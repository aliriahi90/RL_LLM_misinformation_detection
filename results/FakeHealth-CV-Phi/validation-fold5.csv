Lead author Stacey Kenfield, ScD, of UCSF, and a team of researchers at UCSF and Harvard, focused on this variant of prostate cancer to determine if exercise, diet and smoke-free status might have life-saving benefits.\n\nIn the study, published today, Nov. 17, 2015, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the researchers analyzed data from two U.S. studies: the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study that tracked more than 42,000 males ages 40 to 75, from 1986 to 2010; and a second, the Physicians\' Health Study that followed more than 20,000 males ages 40 to 84, from 1982 to 2010.\n\nTo gage the effects of lifestyle habits, the researchers developed a score based on the results of the health professionals survey, then applied it to the physicians\' study. They assigned one point for each affirmative response to questions about regular intense exercise that induced sweating, body mass index (BMI) under 30, tobacco-free status for a minimum of 10 years, high intake of fatty fish, high intake of tomatoes and low intake of processed meat.\n\nTo reduce error, participants had to be free of diagnosed cancer at the start of the study and a four-year lag was imposed to rule out those who unknowingly had lethal prostate cancer, which was determined by evidence of \'prostate cancer death or metastasis to the bones or other organs, excluding the lymph nodes.\' Cases were confirmed through medical records and pathology reports, and cause of death was determined by death certificate and medical record, and secondarily by next of kin.\n\nVigorous activity trumps other lifestyle factors\n\nThe researchers identified 576 cases of lethal prostate cancer in the health professionals\' group and 337 cases in the physicians\' group. Participants with 5 to 6 points in the health professionals\' group had a 68 percent decreased risk of lethal prostate cancer and a 38 percent decreased risk was observed in the physicians\' group for the same comparison. For dietary factors alone, men with three points, versus those with zero points, had a 46 percent decreased chance of developing lethal prostate cancer in the health professionals\' group. In the physicians\' group this decrease was 30 percent.\n\nWhile there were fewer cases and less detailed data collected in the physicians\' study, the score was similar in both populations, indicating the potential benefit of healthy lifestyle habits in warding off lethal prostate cancer, said the authors.\n\n""We estimated that 47 percent of lethal prostate cancer cases would be prevented in the United States if men over 60 had five or more of these healthy habits,"" said Kenfield, assistant professor in the Department of Urology at UCSF Medical Center, and formerly of the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, where the study was initiated.\n\n""It\'s interesting that vigorous activity had the highest potential impact on prevention of lethal prostate cancer. We calculated the population-attributable risk for American men over 60 and estimated that 34 percent of lethal prostate cancer would be reduced if all men exercised to the point of sweating for at least three hours a week,"" Kenfield said.\n\nThe researchers also calculated that lethal prostate cancer among American men over 60 would be cut by 15 percent if they consumed at least seven servings of tomatoes per week and that 17 percent would be spared this diagnosis if they consumed at least one serving of fatty fish per week. Reducing intake of processed meats would cut the risk by 12 percent, they reported. In contrast, the population-attributed risk for smoking was 3 percent, largely because the majority of older American men are long-term nonsmokers.\n\nLifestyle changes also prevent heart disease, diabetes\n\n""This study underscores the ongoing need for more effective prevention measures and policies to increase exercise, improve diet quality and reduce tobacco use in our population,"" said senior author June M. Chan, ScD, from the departments of Urology, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UCSF. ""It takes co-operation and effort from multiple areas, like insurance companies, employers, policy makers and city planners, to figure out how to creatively support and encourage more exercise into most busy adults\' working day. These lifestyle habits align with other recommendations to prevent diabetes and heart disease.""\n\nAbout one man in seven will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime, making it the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the United States, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2015 there will be approximately 220,800 cases of prostate cancer and approximately 27, 540 deaths.\n\n###\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nCo-authors are Erin Van Blarigan, ScD, of the departments of Urology, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UCSF; Howard Sesso, ScD, MPH; Edward Giovannucci, MD, ScD; Meir Stampfer, MD, DrPH, and Julie Batista, ScD, all of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women\'s Hospital; Mary Kathryn Downer and Jaquelyn Jahn both of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and Brigham and Women\'s Hospital.\n\nAbout UCSF:']","Studies tracking older men who participated in vigorous exercise shows they had a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer, but there’s no cause and effect data.","This release summarizes an article in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute which reports that healthy lifestyle habits, including regular vigorous exercise, are associated with reduced risk of death from prostate cancer. The release does a fine job of describing a complex study that actually analyzed two studies and came up with a common scoring system, but could have explained the study limitations and articulated the benefits more clearly for readers. It also overstated the strength of the evidence by suggesting that these habits “save lives” — this study wasn’t capable of demonstrating that.

They noted that dupilumab has also shown the ability to tame atopic dermatitis, or severe eczema, an allergic condition that is not well controlled by current treatments.\n\nResults of the 12-week asthma study are being presented on Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia.\n\nThe medicine, if approved, could hold promise for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled by standard drugs.\n\n“We have been treating asthma with sort of Band-Aid therapies that didn’t get at the underlying causes,” Wenzel said in an interview, adding that dupilumab could be an important step in going to the root of the problem.\n\nThe drug works by simultaneously blocking proteins that have been linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13).\n\nHITS ELUSIVE TARGETS\n\nWenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success.\n\nThe trial recruited patients with high levels of eosinophils, a biomarker that shows immune system cells called type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) associated with allergy and asthma have been activated.\n\nSuch patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment.\n\nAll patients initially stayed on their standard asthma treatments, meaning medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids, as well as long-acting beta agonists. But patients gradually tapered off on those drugs and were no longer taking either of them after 9 weeks.\n\nThroughout the Phase IIa trial, half the patients also received weekly injections of dupilumab, while half received placebo injections.\n\nAfter the ninth week, 25 percent of those on placebos had experienced exacerbations, a catch-all term that included the need to take a beta agonist, a decrease in lung function, the need for an oral or inhaled corticosteroid, or if the patient went to the hospital or emergency room for worsening asthma.\n\n“By end of the trial, after 12 weeks, 44 percent of those in the placebo group had exacerbations, compared with 5 percent of those on dupilumab,” Wenzel said. That represented an 87 percent reduction in exacerbations, which was highly statistically significant.\n\nWenzel said dupilumab was well tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug.\n\nRegeneron and Sanofi said standard drugs are unable to control asthma in 10 to 20 percent of patients. They estimate that inflammation caused by Th2 cells - the type of inflammation among patients they tested - affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and up to 30 million worldwide.\n\nDupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early-stage trials that involved 67 patients with atopic dermatitis. Larger studies are slated to begin later this year.\n\nAtopic dermatitis is inherited and involves patches of highly itchy skin on any part of the body. Patients, many of whom also have asthma and hay fever, have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy.\n\n“This asthma data and the data we already have in atopic dermatitis really raises the possibility the scientific community has finally hit upon the key pathway across all these allergic diseases,” George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s research chief, said in an interview.\n\nTrial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared “compelling” at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.\n\nBut the editorial said effectiveness of dupilumab has been established in just a “limited subpopulation of patients with asthma” because only 21 percent of those screened for enrollment in the study met its criteria.\n\n“We do not know whether dupilumab will be effective in other patient populations,” the editorial said, including patients that stay on their standard therapies and who do not have high levels of eosinophils.']",An adequate summary of this asthma drug trial’s design doesn’t make up for the overly optimistic tone about the drug’s future. A ,"The story provides just about everything you would need to know to decide that this small, short trial had too many problems to prove much of anything. But the story’s reference to this as a “potential game changer,” coupled with quotes from the researchers that are so effusive, and the numbers used to back up the researchers claims are — on the surface — so striking, that most readers will leave this story with the mistaken impression that an massive advance in asthma treatment is just around the corner.

18,story_reviews_00685,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/its-hard-to-know-where-gluten-sensitivity-stops-and-the-placebo-effect-begins/,2015-02-11 11:33:16,It’s Hard To Know Where Gluten Sensitivity Stops And The Placebo Effect Begins,"['Thirty percent of Americans say they’re trying to reduce or eliminate gluten in their diets. But only about 1 percent of the population has an autoimmune response to gluten. Somewhere in that gap, a diet fad is thriving.\n\nThere are two groups of people who should definitely avoid gluten: those diagnosed with wheat allergies and those who have celiac disease. The latter is more common, affecting about 1 percent of the population. The former affects perhaps 0.1 percent of people and is more common in children, who often grow out of it.\n\nWhat is less clear is whether there is another group of individuals whose digestive systems have some “gluten sensitivity” and who would, therefore, benefit from avoiding gluten. The people who think they’re sensitive to gluten are filling the gap between those who should avoid gluten and those who are doing it anyway. But how many people really are sensitive?\n\nGluten, for those of you who have not kept up with dietary fads, is a component of wheat. You eat it in bread, pasta, pizza and so on. Gluten-avoiders are helped by an increasing array of gluten-free breads, pastas and other products. Entire aisles of Whole Foods Market stores appear to be devoted to this trend.\n\nDespite the growing availability of alternative products, avoiding gluten can be a challenge. The satisfying, slightly chewy texture of bread requires gluten. For those of us who care about our health but, let’s face it, like a nice baguette, it seems worth asking: Is there any actual health benefit to gluten avoidance?\n\nThe earliest report on whether gluten could muck with some digestive tracts comes from the late 1970s. Two authors reported on a woman in her early 40s who was experiencing significant “gastrointestinal distress” (bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, etc.) and did not have celiac disease or a wheat allergy. After being put on a gluten-free diet, she improved immediately. When gluten was reintroduced to her diet as a test, the symptoms returned, only to disappear when the gluten was again removed. The authors diagnosed the woman with what they termed “non-celiac gluten sensitivity” (NCGS).\n\nGluten sensitivity fell off the radar for many years, but researchers have returned to it and adopted the same term. In contrast to celiac disease or a wheat allergy, NCGS is not diagnosed through direct testing. Rather, it refers to a condition in which someone experiences some problematic gastrointestinal symptoms that resolve when gluten is avoided. Gastrointestinal symptoms are the hallmark of NCGS — although some people also complain of fatigue or a foggy head.\n\nOf course, it’s difficult to distinguish between someone who is sensitive to gluten and someone who is sensitive to the placebo effect. Since there is no test for gluten sensitivity, “diagnoses” are based on whether people say they feel better when they avoid gluten. But the mind is a powerful thing. If you think avoiding gluten will make you feel better, there is a reasonable chance that it will — even if gluten is irrelevant.\n\nThis effect makes it hard to test for gluten sensitivities even in a randomized controlled trial. If a researcher enrolls people in a standard randomized controlled trial and has some participants eat bread and some not, those who avoid bread may feel better simply because they think they should. The placebo effect may lead a researcher to falsely conclude that avoiding bread is beneficial.\n\nBut that’s not enough. To really get a sense of whether gluten sensitivity is a thing, researchers need to conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which one group eats gluten, another does not, and no one knows which group they are in. That means putting everyone on a gluten-free diet and then directly supplementing some people with gluten protein and others with something that seems similar but has no gluten.\n\nThere have been two small studies like this. They were run by the same team. And, unfortunately for our ability to draw conclusions, they find different results. The first of these, published in 2011, followed 34 people for up to six weeks. The study population was made up of people who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with NCGS.\n\nEveryone participating in the study was on a gluten-free diet. Half had their diet supplemented with a regular muffin and regular bread; the other half received a gluten-free muffin and gluten-free bread. The authors found that 40 percent of patients on the entirely gluten-free diet reported a continuation of symptoms, compared with 68 percent of those who had consumed gluten. The groups also differed on such measures as “satisfaction with stool consistency,” a phrase that I honestly never thought I would write.\n\nThe second study, published in 2013, had a similar set up — 37 people complaining of gastrointestinal problems, randomized into high-gluten, low-gluten and no-gluten groups. This time, rather than using bread and muffins, the authors used gluten and whey protein supplements. They found no difference in symptoms among the groups.\n\nWhy the results of these studies differ is unclear. One possibility is that some participants in the first study guessed which group they were in based on the muffin and bread and therefore the placebo effect became pronounced. Another possibility is simply that given how small the studies were, the differences occurred by chance. Regardless of the reason, we are left with little convincing evidence that gluten avoidance matters.\n\nBut let’s say you take heart in the first of these studies and now believe that avoiding gluten will make some people feel better even though they don’t have an allergy or celiac disease. How many people? Estimates of prevalence of NCGS are based, more or less, on information on gluten avoidance. In the 2009-10 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, about 0.6 percent of people without celiac disease or an allergy say their diet is gluten-free. And in a large Italian study of people who complain of gastrointestinal problems, the authors conclude that NCGS is slightly more common than celiac disease, putting it at a prevalence of a bit above 1 percent of the population.\n\nFor those of you keeping track at home, that means that while 30 percent of Americans are trying to cut gluten from their diet, probably at most only 1 percent of Americans may have NCGS.\n\nIf you don’t have celiac disease or a wheat allergy and are experiencing distressing gastrointestinal symptoms after eating gluten — lack of satisfaction with your stool consistency, for example — there is something like a 1 in 30 chance that the gluten is potentially responsible. If you cut out gluten and it makes you feel better, great. Although it may all be in your head.\n\nIf you are cutting out gluten for any other reason, all that will happen is you’ll feel the same, but without the pleasure of bread that tastes like bread.\n\nCORRECTION (Feb. 12, 11:50 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly state that it is hard to test for gluten allergies. It’s hard to test for gluten sensitivities. The previous version also misstated the probability that gluten is responsible for gastrointestinal distress for those who experience gastrointestinal distress after consuming gluten and who don’t have celiac disease or a wheat allergy. The probability is 1 in 30, not 1 in 100.']","Strong where it counts, this FiveThirtyEight story does a fine job of explaining the research on “non-celiac gluten sensitivity” in simple, clear terms. A couple of minor additions would’ve completed the picture for readers.","“Non-celiac gluten sensitivity” (NCGS) is a condition in which people report gastrointestinal problems related to consuming gluten — even though they do not have either celiac disease or a wheat allergy. The story concludes that, at most, 1 in 30 of the people who have adopted a gluten-free diet to address NCGS actually suffer from it, with the remainder feeling better because of the placebo effect. The story is especially effective at explaining why NCGS is so difficult to study, and why research to date can’t tell us with certainty if the condition really exists.

Prediabetics are at increased risk for developing diabetes, which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels and often leads to cardiovascular disease.\n\nMany people with prediabetes also have untreated sleep apnea, although few of them are aware of it. The most widely accepted treatment for sleep apnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a device that blows a constant pressure of air into the lungs through a tube and face mask during the night. This helps people breathe better while they sleep by keeping the upper airway open.\n\n""Our study showed that CPAP in patients with prediabetes can lower their risk of progressing to diabetes when CPAP is used for eight hours, a full night\'s sleep,"" said the study\'s lead author, Sushmita Pamidi, MD, a former fellow at the University of Chicago who is now on the faculty at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.\n\n""Although eight hours of CPAP per night can be difficult to achieve in real-life, our results should provide a strong incentive for anyone with sleep apnea, especially prediabetic individuals, to improve adherence to their treatment for cardio-metabolic risk reduction,"" she said.\n\nPeople with sleep apnea, which is common among overweight and obese individuals, have repeated episodes where their upper airway closes during sleep. This can disrupt sleep and temporarily lower oxygen levels. It has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and stroke, and may decrease their ability to regulate blood sugar levels. This increases the risk of diabetes.\n\nFor this study, the researchers recruited 39 middle-aged, overweight or obese volunteers with prediabetes and sleep apnea. Two-thirds of them (26) were randomly assigned to two weeks of CPAP treatment. The other 13 received a placebo -- a pill containing no medicine -- to be taken 30 minutes before bedtime. They were told the study would compare the two treatments.\n\nAll participants slept in the sleep laboratory and were closely monitored with all-night sleep recordings during the treatment period. Those assigned to CPAP wore the device for eight hours a night under continuous supervision by a technician. Before and after each treatment period, participants\' glucose metabolism was assessed by oral and intravenous glucose-tolerance tests.\n\nThe researchers also measured the stress hormone noradrenaline in the blood and continuously monitored blood pressure for 24 hours at home. All participants were permitted to leave the laboratory during the day and engage in their routine activities.\n\nAfter two weeks, blood sugar control, as measured by an oral glucose tolerance test, improved for those in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. In addition, the ability of insulin to regulate their blood sugar, estimated by the intravenous glucose tolerance test, was improved in the CPAP group compared to the oral placebo group. The CPAP group had, on average, 27 percent lower levels of the stress hormone, norepinephrine, as well as lower blood pressure than the oral placebo group.\n\n""Despite the demonstrated efficacy of lifestyle interventions and the availability of many drug treatments, the economic and public health burden of diabetes remains enormous,"" said Esra Tasali, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study. ""Assessment of sleep apnea should be considered in patients at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, since our study shows that treatment of sleep apnea can reduce these risks.""\n\n###\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, plus the Diabetes Research and Training Center and the Institute for Translational Medicine at the University of Chicago funded this study. Additional authors include Kristen Wroblewski, Magdalena Stepien, Khalid Sharif-Sidi, Jennifer Kilkus and Harry R. Whitmore from the University of Chicago.']",This is an example of how the careful wording of a published study can get punchier and more aggressive in a news release. A two-week proof-of-concept study can’t tell us whether sleep apnea treatment truly “reduces diabetes risk.”,"This news release outlines a recent paper reporting that a treatment for sleep apnea, called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), could help people with prediabetes who also have sleep apnea to regulate their blood sugar levels. (We have concerns about the release’s use of the term “prediabetes” that we discuss below in the review.) The release says that people with prediabetes and sleep apnea who use a CPAP device for 8 hours overnight have improved blood sugar control, lower levels of the stress hormone noradrenaline, and lower blood pressure. However, it did not, as the headline suggests, show that this approach had any actual impact on one’s risk of developing diabetes. The original study states the findings carefully, but the authors are less cautious when discussing the significance of the findings in the news release (examples below in the review). And while the release does a good job of explaining the study, it could do more to address costs and place its findings in context with past research that found little or no benefit for treating sleep apnea in people with prediabetes.

The paper, The Sternum-Nipple Distance is Double the Nipple-Inframammary Fold Distance in Macromastia, is published Ahead-of-Print online in the Annals of Plastic Surgery.\n\n""Breast reduction is one of the most commonly performed plastic surgery procedures. The long-term appearance after reduction is not optimized 50% of the time using standard reduction techniques,"" notes lead author Dr. Frank Lau. ""At LSU Health New Orleans, we offer an improved technique that preserves more of the critical breast anatomy. This study provides an anatomical foundation for why our technique may yield better, longer-lasting results.""\n\nAbout 50% of patients who undergo the most commonly used breast reduction technique experience pseudoptosis or ""bottoming out"" as a long-term complication. This occurs when breast tissue drops to the lower portion of the breast independent of nipple position.\n\n""We want our patients to have a long-lasting, aesthetically pleasing breast shape,"" says Lau.\n\nBelieving that disruption of the lower suspensory ligaments may be a critical factor because they are stronger than the upper sensory ligaments, the researchers conducted a retrospective review of 208 patients who underwent breast reduction surgery from 2008-2015, studying the results in 400 individual breasts. In all patients, only one reduction technique was performed per patient. Ninety-two percent of the 174 reductions performed with the inferior pedicle technique used a Wise pattern incision, which disrupts the lower suspensory ligaments, and 7.5% used a Boston modification of Robertson technique, which preserves the lower suspensory ligaments. Of the 33 superomedial pedicle reductions, 25 (75.8%) used a Wise pattern incision and 8 (24.2%) used a vertical pattern incision.\n\nBy measuring the sternal notch-nipple distance and the nipple-inframammary fold distance ( proxies for upper and lower sensory ligament strength, respectively), the study found a differential rate of stretch - for every 1 cm in upper sensory ligament stretch, the lower sensory ligament length increases by 0.45 cm. This relationship strengthens the researchers\' hypothesis that the lower pole ligaments stretch at a significantly slower rate than the upper pole ligaments. An anatomic basis for this differential may exist. A horizontal membrane of dense connective tissue originating at the level of the fifth rib that divides the breast into segments at the level of the nipple has been described. This division may signify a transition point in sensory ligament strength. On that basis, the authors recommend that techniques such as the Boston modification of Robertson technique should be preferred by surgeons seeking to avoid pseudoptosis. Other advantages of the Boston modification of Robertson technique include decreased operative time and elimination of the ""triple point,"" the most common site of postoperative incision rupture.\n\n""This study is one of the largest breast anthropometry (measurement) studies ever performed,"" says Lau. ""These results help us provide the best breast reduction outcomes to our patients.""\n\n###\n\nCo-authors include Thomas Steele, a 4th-year medical student at LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine, and Julian Pribaz, MD, of Brigham and Women\'s Hospital, Harvard Medical School.']",The release also neglects to cover cost and any measurable benefits associated with the procedure.,"This news release from Louisiana State Health Sciences Center summarizes results from a retrospective study of two different surgical procedures used in cosmetic breast reduction. The release claims that a modified version of reduction surgery results in fewer cases of breast pseudoptosis, also called “bottoming out” or sagging breasts.
The release adequately notes that the research was a retrospective review (as opposed to a randomized clinical trial) examining the anatomic differences seen in the use of two recognized surgical approaches — and that 92 percent of surgeries performed on 400 breasts (208 patients) used the Wise pattern incision, which purportedly interferes with the lower suspensory ligaments, and just 7.5 percent used a Boston modification of Robertson technique, which preserves the lower suspensory ligaments. No explanation was given for the wide disparity in procedures analyzed.
And it leaves out some other important information from the research. Although the release claims the Boston modification technique is superior to the Wise incision, the published analysis didn’t demonstrate the superiority of the Boston modification procedure. The release didn’t say why the operating surgeon chose one approach over the other. This is important because it may have been based on preference, skill or patient anatomy.

Yet 90% of these patients will be able to return home safely, as no trauma has been detected. Today, the only reliable diagnosis is the CT Scan, which is only available in some hospitals and, in addition to being expensive, exposes patients to radiations. Researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in collaboration with the Hospitals of Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, have developed a small device - Point-of-Care Test (POCT) - that analyses the level of proteins in the blood and allows, using a single drop of blood, to diagnose the possibility of a mild traumatic brain injury. This discovery, described in PLOS ONE, will not only relieve emergency departments, free patients from often long waits, but also save on costly medical examinations.\n\nFalling whilst skiing, tumbling down the stairs or getting hit on the head can cause symptoms such as blurred vision, vomiting, loss of consciousness or memory for about 30 minutes. There is then a risk of mild cerebral trauma, which represents more than 90% of brain injuries admitted to hospitals. But is there really a brain lesion? Or are these symptoms merely the consequence of the violence of the shock, of which will ultimately only leave a bump behind?\n\nToday, the injured patients have to go to the emergency rooms of hospitals equipped with a CT Scan, an expensive examination that sends X-rays to the brain to detect the presence or absence of brain trauma. As their case is not a priority, it often takes a long time for the majority of patients to return home without risk of sequelae, except for bad memories.\n\nFind biomarkers for light traumas\n\n""We wondered if it was possible to isolate certain proteins whose presence in the blood increases in the event of mild traumatic brain injury,» explains Jean-Charles Sanchez, professor at the Department of Internal Medicine of Specialties and the Biomarkers Centre of the Faculty of Medicine of the UNIGE. ""Our idea was to find a way to do a quick examination that would allow, during a boxing or American football match for example, to determine whether the athlete can return to the field or if his condition requires hospitalization. The opposite of the CT Scan, an exam that lasts a long time and cannot be done anywhere,"" he adds.\n\nDuring a shock on the head, some brain cells are damaged and release the proteins they contain, increasing their level in the blood. Scientists at UNIGE and Spanish hospitals then compared the blood of patients admitted for mild traumatic brain injury but diagnosed as negative with that of patients actually suffering from a brain lesion. Using proteomic analyses, which can quantify thousands of proteins simultaneously and observe variations in their levels in the blood, they gradually isolated four molecules indicating the presence of a brain injury: H-FABP, Interleukin-10, S100B and GFAP. ""We have noticed that the H-FABP level alone makes it possible to confirm that there is no risk of trauma in one third of patients admitted after a shock,"" enthuses Jean-Charles Sanchez. The rest of the patients will have to undergo a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTBIcheck, the light brain trauma detector\n\nIt was still necessary to develop a device that could be used everywhere, quickly and simply, and that could be available in pharmacies or sports halls. ""When a person has an accident in the mountain, few practices can do a CT Scan,"" notes the Geneva researcher. His team has developed a rapid diagnostic test (POCT) called TBIcheck, inspired by the principle of pregnancy testing: by placing a single drop of blood on the well of a small 5cm plastic case, the patient knows within 10 minutes whether there is a risk of mild trauma, namely whether or not his H-FABP level is higher than 2.5 nanograms per millilitre of blood.

The goal is to avoid unnecessary medical exams and CT scans. The research behind the device, which is similar to a pregnancy stick test, was published in PLOS One. The news release relates that the test will be marketed next year and allows that the test is not 100% reliable. However, it oversimplifes how concussions are diagnosed, doesn’t give cost data, and relies on some sensational language. Most importantly, it skirts the lack of evidence that patients who use this device will have better outcomes or lower costs than those who don’t.

About 25% of all women who become pregnant have a first-trimester loss. But for some women, every pregnancy results in a loss. The researchers studied the effects of micronized plant-derived progesterone in 116 of these women who had experienced two or more pregnancy losses.\n\nTo determine whether a woman\'s endometrium (uterine lining) is healthy and can sustain the embryo, the research team used the endometrial function test (EFT®), which was created by study co-author Harvey J. Kliman, M.D., director of the Reproductive and Placental Research Unit in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine. An abnormal EFT is associated with pregnancy failure, while a normal EFT is associated with pregnancy success. Kliman and the team focused on the nCyclinE molecular marker as a way to assess patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.\n\nWomen in the study with an abnormal nCyclinE level were prescribed progesterone two days after ovulation, when the uterine lining matures in preparation for a possible pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers believe that the progesterone caused the patients\' endometrium to produce more endometrial secretions. ""The endometrium feeds the baby up until the eighth week of pregnancy. Then at 9 to 10 weeks the mother\'s blood takes over to feed the embryo,"" said Kliman.\n\n""In this subset of women experiencing multiple early miscarriages, we assume that their embryos were literally starving to death,"" Kliman added. ""They attached, but they were not getting enough food. When we give progesterone back to these women, the endometrium makes more nutrients and prevents their pregnancy loss.\n\nKliman said he initially created the Endometrial Function Test (EFT®), which uses the nCyclinE marker, to identify women with infertility. ""This study has shown that the EFT can also be an important tool for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss,"" he said.\n\nKliman worked with lead author Mary Stephenson, M.D., the Dr. Theresa S. Falcon-Cullinan Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and director of the University of Illinois Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Program.\n\n""We are very pleased to find that these results reinforce the evidence that progesterone could be a very beneficial, inexpensive, and safe treatment for many women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss,"" said Stephenson. ""The positive results show us that next we need to study progesterone as a treatment for recurrent pregnancy loss with a prospective randomized trial to validate the findings.""\n\n###\n\nOther authors on the study included Dana McQueen, M.D., and Michelle Wintes, M.D.\n\nCitation: Fertility & Sterility doi:10.1016/j.fertnstert.2016.11.029']",It’s not clear from the release if it’s touting progesterone or a patented test for determining which women might benefit from such therapy.,"This is a somewhat confusing news release that contained very few of the most important details from the study — effectiveness, safety and cost, for example — that anyone would want to know if they were interested in preventing miscarriage. The confusion arises around what is being tested: is it the progesterone, the nCyclinE molecular marker or the Endometrial Function Test (EFT) used in this experiment to identify a subset of women who would benefit from progesterone? Our reviewers were baffled and readers likely will be, too.

Just under a third of women taking flibanserin got over their sexual distress and/or lack of sexual desire (vs. about a fifth of women taking placebo pills). But the difference was important to the women, says study researcher Michael L. Krychman, MD, medical director of sexual medicine at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, Calif.\n\n""The absolute number of women who had remission of sexual distress was clinically significant, but equally important to them was how it improved their lives,"" Krychman tells WebMD.\n\nNearly half of women taking flibanserin (and nearly a third of women taking placebo) reported at least minimal improvement in ""bothersome decreased sexual desire.""\n\nFlibanserin is taken nightly at bedtime. However, it\'s not an on-demand treatment. Data suggest that the drug begins to affect sexual satisfaction after four weeks of continuous treatment.\n\nIn the 24-week ""Bouquet"" studies (each of the Boehringer Ingelheim-funded studies is named after a flower), there were few drug-related side effects. Those most commonly reported were daytime sleepiness, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, dry mouth, nausea, and insomnia. Some 15% of women on flibanserin, and 7% of those on placebo, stopped treatment due to side effects.\n\nUpdated reports on data from the North American ""Daisy"" and ""Violet"" studies were made by Krychman and other researchers at this week\'s annual meeting of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in San Francisco.\n\nKychman is an advisor to Boehringer Ingelheim and serves on their speakers\' bureau, services for which he is compensated.']","A story that early and often reminds readers of the controversies surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of so-called hypoactive sexual desire in women.  Unfortunately the headline promotes the tired old ""female Viagra"" label.

The next goal is to test it in children.\n\n“What we are working on now is to see if we find the same results in younger people,” research leader Declan Murphy, professor of psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, said in an interview.\n\n“We would hope that it would work just as well ... there is no reason why not.”\n\nTREATMENT\n\nThe ability to base a diagnosis on an objective biological test, rather than having to rely on personality traits, should mean patients get treatment more quickly, he added.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy and educational treatment can be highly effective for some patients and the impact of a more certain prognosis would be especially beneficial for children.\n\nMurphy and colleagues, who published their findings in the Journal of Neuroscience, studied 20 healthy adults and another 20 individuals previously diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which also includes Asperger syndrome.\n\nThe accuracy of the scan in predicting autism was so high that the results were strongly significant, despite the small number of patients involved.\n\nExperts not involved in the research applauded the research but cautioned further study was still needed.\n\n“Although this method is not ready for normal diagnostic situations, any step to easier diagnosis is welcome,” said Terry Brugha, professor of psychiatry at the University of Leicester.\n\nMurphy said he envisaged that in future autism specialists would use a scan alongside interviews, in much the same way as doctors monitoring diabetes look at blood test results alongside patient histories.\n\nThe new system works by analyzing variations in the shape and structure of brain regions linked to language and social behavior, using standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines made by companies like General Electric, Siemens and Philips.\n\nThe speed of the test makes it some 20 times cheaper than traditional tests, which can take a team of doctors four to eight hours to conduct. The actual brain scan costs around 100 pounds ($157.5).\n\nAutism spectrum disorders are diagnosed in one percent of the population in Britain and the United States, and the condition affects four times as many boys as girls. Researchers agree there is a strong genetic component.']",A story that was flawed at its core – treating the outcome of not-yet-done studies in children as a fait accompli.  The three-star score is deceptively high. ,"The enthusiasm this story effuses about a new brain scanning technology to diagnose autism may well be warranted. But it fails to give more than the most cursory of cautions about the early stage of this research and the tough road that lies ahead. The story makes it sound like we are a slam dunk away from seeing this test at the local radiology clinic. In reality, much larger studies with a much greater range of patients will be needed to tell whether the scan is effective enough to be widely used.

Some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen (also an NSAID), and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo, he told Reuters Health.\n\n“I tell my patients, ‘buyer beware,’” Shepard said in an email. “I tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature. I tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it, then keep taking it.”\n\nIf chondroitin doesn’t work for them, he suggests taking an NSAID “periodically,” and to be aware of the side effects.\n\n“If you are going to stay on an NSAID for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor,” Shepard cautioned.\n\nDr. Rachel Wolfe of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that chondroitin is “reasonable to try” for some people, especially those with contraindications to NSAIDs.\n\n“However, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. It should be used in conjunction with these measures,” said Wolfe, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\n“Chondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,” Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. “Studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.”\n\nThe study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2rcPLh0 Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, online May 22, 2017.']","This story wisely makes it clear that when it comes to chondroitin supplements, the jury is still out.","This story does a good job putting a new study on chondroitin for knee pain in context of previous findings, informing readers that it adds to the mixed results, with some studies reporting positive results and others reporting no effect.

The drug, known as 10-1074, may also offer a new way to prevent viral infection in people who are at high risk to acquire HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nThe drug belongs to a class of molecules called broadly neutralizing antibodies, which are naturally found in HIV-infected people whose immune systems have a rare ability to fight off the virus. These antibodies are a major area of study in the laboratory of Rockefeller University investigator Michel Nussenzweig, who is Zanvil A. Cohn and Ralph M. Steinman Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology. Marina Caskey, an Assistant Professor of Clinical Investigation, leads clinical studies on these antibodies.\n\n""This was the first human trial of 10-1074,"" says Till Schoofs, an Instructor in Clinical Investigation in Nussenzweig\'s lab. ""The antibody binds to a different part of the virus than the other antibody we\'ve studied. In addition, it\'s one of the most potent broadly neutralizing antibodies described to date.""\n\nToday, HIV is typically treated with antiretroviral therapy, a drug regimen that became available in the 1990s. Although it has been a lifesaver for people infected with the virus, antiretroviral medications have significant drawbacks: they can cause severe side effects, and patients have to take them for life. This is why researchers continue to look for other ways to control the virus--and broadly neutralizing antibodies could prove to be part of an alternate treatment strategy.\n\nThe study of 10-1074, an early-stage clinical trial, included 19 individuals who were infected with HIV and 14 who were not. The purpose was to determine whether the antibody was safe and whether it had antiviral activity in humans. The majority of the people in the trial were enrolled at The Rockefeller University Hospital, while some of the HIV-1 infected participants received the antibody at the University of Cologne, in Germany. ""It has been challenging to find trial participants with high levels of the virus here in New York,"" Caskey says, ""so our collaboration with the University of Cologne has been very valuable.""\n\nThe investigators found that among 13 HIV-infected people who received the highest dose of 10-1074, 11 showed a rapid decline in the amount of virus. Although these patients were found to have some resistant virus in their blood, further research in the lab showed that those viruses were still sensitive to other broadly neutralizing antibodies, including 3BNC117, that target different parts of the pathogen. The results were published in January in Nature Medicine.\n\nCaskey, Schoofs, and their team also analyzed the uninfected participants\' blood samples, and found that 10-1074 may be an effective way to prevent infection in people who are exposed to the virus. Currently, people who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk of getting it--because they have multiple sexual partners, for example, or an HIV-infected partner--can receive antiviral medications to prevent disease, a strategy called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). But just like the antiviral medications used to treat infection, PrEP can have severe side effects and must be taken daily to be effective, which poses significant challenges to adequate compliance.\n\n""Based on our findings we think these types of antibodies could be a viable substitute for the drugs currently used in PrEP,"" says Caskey. ""But to clearly demonstrate that these antibodies have an advantage over the pill that\'s currently used, we would need to test them in large numbers of people and show that they remain active for a prolonged period of time in the body.""\n\nIn an effort to accomplish this, the investigators are looking into modified variants of the antibodies with prolonged activity, so that they would need to be given less often in the PrEP setting. And they are already moving forward with new clinical studies using 10-1074 together with 3BNC117, with the hope that combining two antibodies targeting different parts of HIV will be more effective than either antibody on its own.\n\n###']",But it does include perhaps over-eager suggestions that this new drug could replace standard pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).,"While this study of a clinical trial of a new biologic agent called 10-1074 is understandably exciting for HIV researchers — it involved just 33 people (19 individuals who were infected with HIV and 14 who were not) — and lacked important detail which would have made it more meaningful for the rest of us.
We give the release credit for acknowledging that the biologic drug is still preliminary and needs to be tested in a larger trial, but that caution seems overshadowed by the other premature projections made in the release.
The stated purpose of the research was “to determine whether the antibody was safe and whether it had antiviral activity in humans” but the news release didn’t tell us the actual results of the trial and what this might mean in the larger context of HIV treatment.

It turns markings on a page or a screen into coherent thoughts. It’s a complicated process: The eyes see a procession of letters, and the brain turns them into words.\n\nThe reading process is challenging for people with dyslexia. The disorder isn’t well understood, but there seems to be a communication breakdown between the eyes and the brain. Some people with dyslexia have trouble associating letters with sounds and words. Others say that words and letters look blurry, distorted or jumbled.\n\nChromaGen Vision says it can help restore order to the written word. The company offers glasses and contact lenses with a special tint that supposedly help people with dyslexia read faster and more accurately.\n\nVisitors to the ChromaGen website are asked to complete a seven-question survey to see if the lenses may be right for them. If they answer yes to questions like “Do you notice that words or sentences are blurry or wiggly during reading?” they are encouraged to make an appointment with a certified practitioner, usually an optometrist. A list of providers is on the website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lenses come in 16 shades, all of which look neutral gray when viewed on someone’s face. Practitioners mix and match them to come up with the pair of lenses that works best for each client. Prices vary, but a set of glasses, complete with the exam, typically costs a bit less than $1,000. A fitting for a pair of contact lenses costs about $500, but you would have to replace them every six months.\n\nThe claims\n\nAccording to the company website, ChromaGen essentially works by slowing down the visual processing of letters and words, giving the language center of the brain time to catch up. A video includes testimonials from children who say the lenses stopped words from jumping or wiggling around on the page.\n\nThe website claims the lenses can help about 50% of people with dyslexia, but ChromaGen Chief Executive Ted Edwards in Kennett Square, Pa., says the true rate is probably much higher. “It’s a life-changing aid,” he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Politzer, an optometrist in Brentwood, Tenn., who has prescribed about a half-dozen pairs of ChromaGen lenses, says that he’s seen “great results with properly screened patients.” He notes that there are different types of dyslexia, and only people who have trouble with visual distortions while reading are likely to benefit.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nDyslexia is a complex and controversial condition. Edwards says he’s well aware that many experts consider dyslexia a problem of language processing, not of vision, and that they tend to scoff at the notion that tinted lenses could help dyslexic people read.\n\nAnd indeed, that’s the stance taken by Dr. Sheryl Handler, a pediatric ophthalmologist in Encino. “Dyslexia is not a visually based disorder,” says Handler, who led a 2011 report on dyslexia in the journal Pediatrics. “There is definitely no evidence that the lenses will improve dyslexia.”\n\nThat view is shared by Deborah Giaschi, a professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who has conducted MRI studies of the brains of people with dyslexia. “There’s really no scientific basis” for ChromaGen lenses, she says. In her opinion, the claim that the lenses slow down visual processing doesn’t make sense. Even if the lenses had that effect, she doesn’t see how that would help anyone read.\n\n“Parents are desperate to help their kids, and this company is taking their money,” Giaschi says.\n\nA search of the medical literature found a single, company-funded study suggesting that ChromaGen lenses could improve the reading skills of people with dyslexia. The study of 47 dyslexics, led by optician and lens inventor David Harris, found that ChromaGen lenses worked significantly better than placebo lenses.\n\nGiaschi says the study is unconvincing and the results have never been confirmed by other researchers. She adds that the lack of follow-up studies in the last decades is a clear sign that dyslexia researchers don’t take the approach seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Chase, a professor of optometry at Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, who has investigated the role of visual disturbances in dyslexia, agrees that the current scientific evidence for ChromaGen lenses is slim. But he said that if a person has trouble focusing on words and letters, tinted lenses could potentially help eyes work together to clear up the picture. In such cases, ChromaGen “could be worth a try,” he says.\n\nBut Giaschi has a different suggestion. “It would make more sense to spend your money on something that’s proven to help.

But when CBS News met her this spring, she was a patient who was about to undergo same-day hip replacement surgery.\n\nThe 61-year-old had been having hip pain for the past two years because of arthritis. She had heard a lot of positive feedback from people who had undergone hip replacement surgery at her hospital. A big attraction for her was the possibility of going home right after the surgery.\n\n""The option to go home the same day and have that family around me was something that I wanted to do,"" said Spina.\n\nShe believed she would be able to recuperate more comfortably at home and get back on her feet faster.\n\nAt most hospitals, hip replacement patients can expect a one- to three-night hospital stay. Total hip replacement surgery is increasingly common, with more than 300,000 procedures done every year in the U.S. The surgery is meant to restore range of motion and help relieve arthritic pain. The procedure consists of removing the patient\'s worn out ball and socket joint and inserting an artificial socket. On the femur side, a stem is inserted into the bone and a ball is on the tip of it.\n\nNYU Langone Medical Center said it became the first academic medical center in New York City to implement a same-day hip replacement program, in 2015.\n\nDr. Roy Davidovitch, director of NYU Langone\'s Hip Center, said he performs around 400 hip replacements a year and approximately 40 percent of those patients will go home the same day.\n\nDavidovitch said patients are happier going home sooner. ""Nothing beats the comfort of your own home for recovery. And to be quite honest, if the pain is controlled and the patient is healthy and medically completely stable there is no reason for them to be in the hospital. It really doesn\'t make sense.""\n\nDebbie Spina doing pre-hab at NYU Langone Medical Center. CBS News\n\nThere are two common surgical approaches for a total hip replacement: anterior, which involves entering surgically through the front of the hip, and posterior, or entering surgically through the side or buttocks.\n\nAccording to research done by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, there are no significant differences between either approach in recovery outcomes six months after surgery.\n\nDavidovitch favors the anterior approach, which he believes has a faster and less painful recovery period in the short term because doctors don\'t have to cut through muscles or tendons to get to the hip like in the posterior approach. He does agree that in the long term, both procedures have the same outcomes for patients.\n\nThe anterior approach to hip replacement may result in a quicker short-term recovery, but over the long run patients\' outcomes are the same. CBS News\n\nBut it\'s not the surgical approach alone that allows some of his patients to go home the same day -- it\'s a combination of what happens before, during and after surgery.\n\nAt NYU Langone patients have to do what\'s called pre-hab. Before the surgery they work with an occupational and physical therapist to learn information on the procedure, learn exercises to do after the surgery and how to properly move around while they are recovering.\n\nDuring the surgery, Davidovitch uses a short-acting spinal anesthetic that lasts about 2 ½ hours, and when closing the wound he injects ""a cocktail of medications"" to help with the inflammation and pain.\n\nPatients can be up and walking usually within three hours after the surgery.\n\nBut they must have someone around the first night they are spending at home post-surgery.\n\n""The people who are against the whole idea for same-day discharge for hip replacement are concerned about the very rare instances where somebody could develop a blood clot that goes to the lung, or a fracture of some sort,"" said Davidovitch. ""The rates of blood clots or pulmonary emboli is exceedingly low. And in general, if a patient is identified as a high risk or a higher risk we don\'t send them home the same day.""\n\nDr. Davidovitch and his surgical team performing a hip replacement. NYU Langone Medical Center\n\nDavidovitch makes it clear that this kind of surgery is not one-size-fits-all. Patients are screened first to make sure they don\'t have risk factors like obesity, chronic liver disease or cardiac problems. Those who have risk factors must plan on staying overnight in the hospital, not going right home.\n\nHowever, not every surgeon is embracing the same-day trend. Douglas E. Padgett, M.D., chief of the joint replacement service at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, is a lot more conservative about who he believes is the optimal patient for going home the same day.\n\n""The number of patients that are going home at this point in time in our institution is somewhere between one and two percent. So it\'s a relatively small percentage of patients that are going directly home,"" said Padgett.\n\nPadgett has seen an increase in the number of hip replacement patients and a decrease in their age -- some are as young as their 40s and 50s. He said his department performs the most hip replacements of any institution in the U.S., doing about 5,000 a year. While he is not against patients going home the same day, he cautions that total joint replacement is a major procedure and doctors need to be careful to avoid sending patients home too soon.\n\n""While I recognize there is no place like home, should there be the need for urgent or medical care the question is will that be available to the patient when they\'re in the setting of their own home,"" Padgett said.\n\nDebbie Spina met all the requirements to go home the same day. Her surgery lasted about an hour, which is the average time for her type of procedure. After the the operation she was able to move around but felt dizzy and nauseous. The occupational and physical therapists waited until evening to try and get her to go up and down steps and walk around, which patients must be able to do before they are discharged. But Spina didn\'t feel well enough, so she actually ended up spending the night.\n\nEven though her same-day discharge didn\'t go as planned, Spina felt good the following morning and was able to do her exercises and leave the hospital.\n\nAfter her recovery is complete, she has a few goals she\'d like to reach. ""I had walked prior to this four miles every morning -- I\'d like to do that. And I\'d like to improve my golf game if possible,"" Spina said while smiling.\n\nDavidovitch\'s goal is for patients to return to their normal level of activity as quickly as possible. And with many people wanting to maintain active lifestyles well into their 70s and beyond, he expects to see even greater demand for hip replacement surgery and the same-day option. ""In general I see this growing to about 60 percent of my practice,"" he said.']","The story includes important cautions from a skeptical surgeon, but the prominence of the surgeon and institution that are actively marketing this procedure results in a story that implies greater benefits and fewer risks than there is evidence to support.","This is a story about “same-day” hip replacement surgery. The story gives readers the impression that a few pioneering institutions are offering patients a superior procedure, when the reality is that hospital stays after hip replacement have been steadily shortening for many years, to the point that it is not unusual for some otherwise healthy patients to go home without spending a night in the hospital.
The story includes important cautions from a skeptical surgeon, but the prominence of the surgeon and institution that are actively marketing this procedure results in a story that implies greater benefits and fewer risks than there is evidence to support.

Now, 22 years later, a drug that tries to compensate for the genetic defect might be nearing the market.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals announced Wednesday morning that the drug, VX-770, improved lung function in people with cystic fibrosis in a late-stage clinical trial. The drug also reduced the frequency of disease exacerbations that required treatment with antibiotics.\n\nThe caveat is that VX-770 is designed to counter one specific genetic mutation that accounts for about 4 percent of cases of cystic fibrosis. Vertex is working on another drug for the most common mutation, but that one is further behind in development.\n\nStill, the news is expected to be greeted favorably by doctors and patients and by Wall Street.\n\n“I’ve been doing clinical trials for 30 years in C.F. and these are amazing results,’’ Dr. Bonnie W. Ramsey, a lead investigator in the trial, said in an interview.\n\nDr. Ramsey, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington, was briefed on the results by Vertex.\n\nThe results were announced by a press release and have not been peer reviewed by experts.\n\nAbout 30,000 Americans and 70,000 people worldwide have cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by defects in a gene responsible for the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes. People with the disease tend to have very thick mucus in their lungs, which leads to infections and lung damage. Many do not live past age 40.\n\nTwo inhaled antibiotics and one drug that loosens mucus are approved to treat cystic fibrosis, but nothing that directly improves chloride ion transport.\n\n\n\nIn the trial, those who received VX-770 gained 10.6 percentage points more on a lung function test after 24 weeks than those getting a placebo, a difference that statistically was highly significant. Patients continued to take either drug or placebo for another 24 weeks and the improvement was sustained. Lung function, the primary endpoint of the trial, was measured by how much a person could exhale in one second, a standard test.\n\nInvestors had been expecting around a 5 percentage point improvement. In a note to clients Tuesday evening, before the results were known, an analyst at ISI Group, Mark Schoenebaum, said that an improvement of 10 percent would be a “home run’’ that could lead to $600 million in annual sales for the drug.\n\nDr. Ramsey, who has received research grants from Vertex, said that some patients could perceive a 10 percentage point change in lung function. She said other results of the trial were encouraging.\n\nThese included fewer exacerbations of the disease in those who got the drug, fewer self-reported respiratory symptoms, and a gain in weight, which is good for people with cystic fibrosis, who often have digestive problems. The saltiness of their sweat — a measure used to diagnose the disease — was markedly reduced, suggesting that the drug was having an effect on chloride ion transport.\n\nThe trial involved 161 people age 12 and older, all with at least one copy of the particular mutation, known as G551D. The main side effects, Vertex said, were headache, upper respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion, rash and dizziness.\n\nVertex said it hoped to apply in the second half of the year for approval of VX-770 in the United States and Europe. The company is awaiting results of a second trial of the drug, this one in younger children.\n\nVertex has not said how much it will charge for VX-770. But since there are only about 1,200 Americans who are candidates for the drug, the price is likely to be tens of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nVertex, based in Cambridge, Mass., was founded in 1989, coincidentally the same year the cystic fibrosis gene was discovered. It has not yet had a big commercial success and had a $2.5 billion net loss in the last five years.\n\nThe company is hoping that by late May it will win approval to sell a new type of drug for hepatitis C, which analysts expect will be a blockbuster.\n\nThe long time needed to develop a drug for cystic fibrosis is a lesson for those expecting a quick payout from the sequencing of the human genome, which was completed a decade ago. It is not enough to know the gene behind a disease. It can take years of research to determine how a mutation actually causes a disease and then to design a drug that corrects the problem.\n\nVertex received $75 million in financial support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, one of the first nonprofit disease groups to give money to companies.\n\n“These results are highly encouraging,’’ Robert J. Beall, president of the foundation, said in a statement Wednesday. “They provide scientific evidence that support our long-standing belief that targeting the underlying defect of C.F. may have a profound effect on the disease.’’']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">An excellent article overall.

The release doesn’t say.,"This news release focusing on a small study of acupuncture treatment adherence published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine does a good job framing what the study can and cannot tell us — for the most part. However, it strays a bit when it says the study should give parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) a “hopeful sign” and states it measured the effects of the intervention on the children’s behavior, ability to pay attention, sleep, and parenting stress — but shared none of these findings.  There is no mention of quantified benefits, cost or potential harms.
According to the release, the study was designed to determine whether young children, ages 3 to 10, with autism were able to complete an eight-week regiment of acupuncture treatment. The key finding appears to be the fact that all 10 children completed the therapy, which was performed twice weekly over eight weeks. The release would have been improved had it included more details and some data from the study on those aspects of the things that were measured — the children’s behavior, attentiveness and sleep. Or, since this was such a tiny study whose results are likely to be unreliable anyway, perhaps those aspects should have been left out of the release entirely.

The hospital was one of 117 medical centers in the United States and Canada to participate in a National Institutes of Health clinical trial between 2000 and 2008.\n\nThe 2,500 participants were used to compare carotid endarterectomy, a surgical procedure to clear blocked blood flow, to carotid artery stenting, a newer and less invasive procedure that involves threading a stent and expanding a small protective device in the artery to widen the blocked area and capture any dislodged plaque. The trial compared the safety and effectiveness of the two procedures in patients with or without a stroke history.\n\n""Earlier studies were done for patients who had a high risk for surgery, were over the age of 80 and had previous heart attacks or other high risk factors for strokes,"" said Dr. Harish Shownkeen, an interventional neuroradiologist and co-medical director of the stroke and neurovascular program at Central DuPage Hospital.

For patients with moderate to severe cirrhosis (decompensated cirrhosis), Epclusa is approved for use in combination with the drug ribavirin. Epclusa is a fixed-dose combination tablet containing sofosbuvir, a drug approved in 2013, and velpatasvir, a new drug, and is the first to treat all six major forms of HCV.\n\n“This approval offers a management and treatment option for a wider scope of patients with chronic hepatitis C,” said Edward Cox, M.D., director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\nHepatitis C is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to diminished liver function or liver failure. There are at least six distinct HCV genotypes, or strains, which are genetically distinct groups of the virus. Knowing the genotype helps inform treatment recommendations and the duration of treatment. Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1; 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3; and a small numbers of patients are infected with genotypes 4, 5 or 6. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HCV infection becomes chronic in approximately 75 to 85 percent of cases. Patients who suffer from chronic HCV infection over many years may have complications, such as bleeding, jaundice (yellowish eyes or skin), fluid accumulation in the abdomen, infections, liver cancer and death.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Epclusa for 12 weeks was evaluated in three Phase III clinical trials of 1,558 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (mild cirrhosis). Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infections had been cured. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa was also evaluated in a clinical trial of 267 subjects with decompensated cirrhosis (moderate to severe cirrhosis), of whom 87 subjects received Epclusa in combination with ribavirin for 12 weeks, and 94 percent of these patients had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment.\n\nThe most common side effects of Epclusa include headache and fatigue. Epclusa and ribavirin combination regimens are contraindicated for patients for whom ribavirin is contraindicated.\n\nEpclusa carries a warning for patients and health care providers that serious slowing of the heart rate (symptomatic bradycardia) and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is used with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct-acting antiviral. Co-administration of amiodarone with Epclusa is not recommended. Epclusa also carries a warning not to use with certain drugs that may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which could lead to reduced efficacy of Epclusa.\n\nEpclusa was reviewed under the FDA’s priority review program, which provides for an expedited review of drugs that treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvement in safety or effectiveness.\n\nEpclusa is manufactured and marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., of Foster City, California.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency is also responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###\n\nInquiries Media: Theresa Eisenman 301-796-2969 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA\n\nRelated Information']",Some background on the clinical trials that led to approval of a new hepatitis C drug and where they can be accessed would make this release more complete.,"This release announces the approval by the FDA of a new pill, Epclusa, for patients with chronic infections with Hepatitis C virus, also known as HCV. The tablet combines an existing drug, sofosbuvir, with a new drug, velpatasvir, and is the first single therapy for all six major forms of the virus. Patients can be infected with different forms and require different treatments.

REUTERS/NIR ELIAS\n\nThe pain reduction was “modest” - less than 1 point on an 11-point scale for the strongest marijuana - and patients reported no overall difference in their quality of life based on what they smoked.\n\nThe results support a limited number of trials that have suggested marijuana may be helpful for people suffering from chronic pain, but that it also has its limitations.\n\n“This offers another potential tool in the tool box for treating chronic neuropathic pain,” Dr. Mark Ware, a neuroscientist at the McGill University Health Center in Montreal and the study’s lead author, told Reuters Health. But there are still questions about marijuana’s long-term safety as a pain reliever, he said.\n\nWare and his colleagues recruited 21 adults who were suffering from chronic neuropathic pain after an injury or surgery. Three times a day, for five days, participants took a 25 milligram hit of one of four treatments: marijuana that was 2.5 percent, 6 percent, or 9.4 percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or a 0 percent placebo. All patients rotated in random order through the four different treatments, with a nine-day break between each one.\n\nDuring each treatment, participants were asked about their pain, sleep patterns, mood, and overall quality of life.\n\nPatients smoking 9.4 percent THC marijuana reported lower pain scores than when smoking the placebo - on average, 5.4 versus 6.1 on a scale from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain”). They also reported that they slept better, and were less anxious and depressed than when they were on the placebo.\n\nWhen smoking marijuana with moderate doses of THC, participants generally reported improved symptoms, but there was no significant difference in their relief from these doses compared to relief from the placebo treatment. There was also no difference in the quality of life or mood scores that participants reported when they were on any of the four treatments.\n\nThe highest dose of THC produced the most side effects, which included headaches, dry eyes, and a burning sensation in the regions where patients had pain.\n\nIn the second, third and fourth rounds of treatment, most - but not all - patients were able to tell when they had been on either the highest THC dose or the placebo. Most patients did not report feeling “high” at any point during the study.\n\nAbout 1 to 2 percent of adults in the U.S. suffer from chronic neuropathic pain - pain that occurs when nerve fibers are damaged by injury or disease, and lingers even after the original wound has healed. The condition is treated with a range of different medications, including drugs usually intended for people with depression and epilepsy. But these don’t work for all patients, and some also have uncomfortable side effects.\n\n“A lot of the treatments that are used for neuropathic pain ...might also be associated with disruptions in sleep,” Dr. Andrea Hohmann, who studies marijuana and pain at the University of Georgia and was not involved with the current study, told Reuters Health. For that reason, the finding that marijuana may actually help improve patients’ sleep, she said, is “particularly noteworthy.”\n\nThe cannabinoid family, which includes marijuana, is “emerging as an interesting new class of drugs for pain management,” Ware said. But, “we also know that treating chronic pain of any kind requires more than just (drugs),” he said. No matter what kind of medication they’re on, these patients should also be getting behavioral and physical therapy, he said.\n\nThe study’s five-day treatment sessions also leave questions about patients with chronic conditions who might need treatment for months or years. “The trial did not last long ... so the authors cannot really say whether any response would be sustained,” Dr. Henry McQuay, who studies pain and pain relief at the University of Oxford, wrote in an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nWare agreed that more research is needed. “What about long-term safety issues?” he asked. “These need to be considered before the drug becomes prescribable.”\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/pyd77n Canadian Medical Association Journal, online August 30, 2010.']",Better than the ,"The story did a great job evaluating the evidence, providing outside voices, discussing alternatives to marijuana smoking, and presenting both the benefits and the potential harms. It could have done a better job discussing possible costs, availability and conflicts of interest.

""Women need to become educated about the risk factors, especially those they can control, and then adjust their lifestyle accordingly.""\n\nNot all women with breast cancer experience the same warning signs of the disease. Symptoms of breast cancer may include:\n\nA lump in the breast or armpit.\n\nSwelling or thickening in part of the breast.\n\nDimpling or irritation of the skin on the breast.\n\nPain in the breast that doesn\'t go away.\n\nRedness or flaky skin on the breast or nipple.\n\nUnusual nipple discharge.\n\nA change in the size or shape of the breast.\n\nIn some cases, women never develop any of these symptoms, Evers noted.\n\n""All women should know how their breasts look and feel so they can recognize any changes in them.

Is an app-based self-care program particularly attractive to young women? These questions addressed in a new study by researchers from Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, the results of which have been published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology*.\n\nApproximately 50 to 90 percent of young women experience pain during their periods. While this pain primarily manifests itself as lower abdominal cramping, other symptoms include headache, backache, nausea and diarrhea. Acupressure is a technique derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. Rather than using needles, this technique involves massage or pressure being applied to specific points on the body.\n\nThe researchers wanted to evaluate whether in a group of women suffering from severe menstrual pain, aged between 18 and 34, self-acupressure would be more effective at achieving a sustained reduction in menstrual pain than usual care alone (e.g. pain medication and hormonal contraceptives). A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which received a study app and short introduction. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. One advantage of an app-based intervention is its ability to provide visual descriptions of the pressure points users need to target in order to achieve the desired effect. It can also send regular reminders. Additionally, the app was used to collect all study-related data.\n\n""Initially, we simply wanted to conduct a study on the use of self-care techniques for menstrual pain. However, the women who were involved during the planning stages, all of whom were affected by menstrual pain, wanted an app,"" reports the study\'s principal investigator, Prof. Dr. Claudia Witt of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points.\n\nAfter three months, 37 percent of participants in the acupressure group reported a 50 percent reduction in pain intensity. After six months, this proportion had increased to more than half of the women in this group (58 percent). Only 25 percent of women in the control group reported a similar reduction in pain intensity at both the 3-month and 6-month marks. Women in the acupressure group also used less pain medication than women in the control group and reported lower levels of pain overall.\n\n""We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure. So far, research into the clinical effectiveness of apps has been limited, and only a few have been tested using randomized controlled trials,"" says Dr. Daniel Pach of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. He adds: ""We were able to show that apps can be evaluated in a clinical trial setting. However, despite our experience with conventional clinical trials, there was a lot for us to learn - something we found both exciting and eye-opening.""

The release does a reasonable job of describing the study outcomes, how researchers went about conducting a randomized controlled trial using a “self care” app, and in describing statistically significant pain reduction over six months in some women.
Careful readers will likely come away with the idea that acupressure — essentially massage and manipulation applied to certain parts of the torso — is not the final answer to menstrual pain.

They can’t see or recognize anything on one side of their body.\n\nThis condition often occurs after a stroke on the right side of the brain and is typically treated with a combination of physical therapy and brain retraining or mental tasks using a pen and paper or computer. This is often not enough to make a meaningful improvement.\n\nNow new research in Neurology suggests that stimulating the nerve cells in the brain with magnet therapy may aid recovery. During transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a doctor places a large magnetic coil against the patient’s scalp, which creates electric currents to stimulate nerve cells.\n\nAfter a stroke, one side of the brain can become overactive and its circuits can get overloaded. Enter TMS. This therapy may restore balance between the two sides of the brain.\n\nAnd according to the new study, it helps.\n\nTen out of 20 people who faced this problem following a stroke received the magnet therapy daily for two weeks. The other 10 received a fake treatment. All participants also did standard brain retraining.\n\nEveryone took tests that measured their abilities after the study and then again two weeks later.

""It\'s pretty amazing. It\'s potentially huge.""\n\n""This is something we\'ve been waiting to see,"" he continued.\n\n""This directly interferes with the genetic mechanisms that promote cancer to stop the production of a particular protein,"" added Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ""This is one step away from getting into the actual DNA.""\n\nAs reported online March 21 in Nature, this is the first time the process, known as RNA interference (RNAi), has been shown to work in humans.\n\nThe process of RNA interference involves putting two strands of RNA together to form so-called ""small interfering RNAs"" (siRNAs) and inserting them into cells. Once there, these interlopers cut the messenger RNA (mRNA) that is ordinarily used to make specific proteins. This discovery won the Nobel Prize in 2006.\n\nBut the work that nabbed the prize was done in worms -- a far cry from humans.\n\nAnd there were other challenges, not the least of which was how to get the siRNAs into the appropriate cell and then make sure they did what they were supposed to do.\n\nThis team, from the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), devised a super-small nanoparticle system that, when injected into the body, would make its way to the tumor, deposit the siRNAs into the tumor cell and leave them to their assigned task.\n\nThis early-phase clinical trial involved actual patients with melanoma, a particularly virulent form of skin cancer.\n\nThe experiment proceeded just as planned, as biopsies later showed.\n\nThe researchers injected the cargo-laden nanoparticles into the patients, much as you would administer a flu or any other type of shot. They did not inject directly into the tumor as many other researchers have done.\n\nThe nanoparticles made their way smoothly to the target -- the tumor cell -- and cleaved the mRNA in just the right place, stopping production of the culprit protein.\n\nThe precision of the process is crucial to limiting side effects, the researchers said.\n\n""Now you can go selectively at proteins involved in the disease and not have off-target effects,"" explained Mark E. Davis, lead author of the paper, and professor of chemical engineering at CalTech in Pasadena. ""Normally when you make drugs, it\'s hard to say \'attack only that protein.\' In this particular case, I\'m going to go in at the genetic level and eliminate that one protein I want to eliminate.""\n\nAnd unlike conventional gene therapy -- where the offending gene is replaced by a new one or overridden -- this therapy is reversible, said Adams.\n\n""This will run its course. Ultimately, it will restore itself,"" he said.\n\nThe authors believe the same system could provide a highly targeted, selective way to reach many different genes and affect tumors that have untll now eluded drug therapy.\n\nObviously, the process will have to be refined and optimized before it\'s actually used for treatment.\n\n""This is the first qualitative \'yes, we can do it\' publication and it really has to be kept in that perspective,"" Adams said.\n\nMore information\n\nThere\'s more on RNA interference at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.']","Should we be calling something a ""breakthrough"" after evidence from tests on three tumor samples? ","Yes, it could lead to a breakthrough, but, after tests on just a few tumor samples (something not disclosed in the article), it could also lead  to something far less than a breakthrough. 
The story fell victim to over-enthusiastic language (""…this is the first time the process, known as RNA interference (RNAi), has been shown to work in humans"").  To the average reader this would suggest that there was a treatment effect and that is a far cry from what actually was seen.

If a man has any type of damage to the prostate, his PSA level can go up. ""More often than not, the damage is due to benign (noncancerous) conditions such as enlarged prostate"" -- a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, Groskopf tells WebMD.\n\nThis often triggers unnecessary biopsies and, sometimes, unnecessary surgery.\n\nThe PCA3 test isn’t a replacement for PSA testing.

Spinning blood samples in a centrifuge, researchers found they could break open those sacs and readily detect a protein called glypican-1, which is overexpressed in breast and pancreatic cancers.\n\nThe finding “offers the possibility for early detection of pancreatic cancer and help in designing potential curative surgical options,” the authors of the new research wrote. For a cancer that has already metastasized in four of five patients newly diagnosed, earlier detection holds a strong promise of improving pancreatic cancer’s dismal survival rate, they added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPancreatic cancer is the deadliest of all common cancers in the United States. An estimated 44,000 are diagnosed with the malignancy each year in the country, usually when it has reached a very advanced stage and few treatment options are effective.

Although she said its findings need to be replicated in much larger groups, she hailed the finding as “clinically important.”\n\nUC San Francisco cancer physician Alan Venook cautioned, however, that much more needs to be known about the telltale sign of cancer explored in the new research before its lifesaving properties can be established.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The issue is, can you detect these in patients that don’t have advanced cancer?” Venook said. “The answer is, we don’t know.” The numbers tested by the MD Anderson researchers -- 251 patients with pancreatic cancer (five of whom had very early lesions), 32 with chronic pancreatitis and 120 healthy controls -- aren’t nearly large enough to draw such conclusions.

These imaging findings can help spur beneficial lifestyle changes in patients to reduce risk for Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\nThe concept that cognitive decline can be identified early and prevented by applying quantitative brain imaging techniques is the focus of ""Hot Topics in Research: Preventive Neuroradiology in Brain Aging and Cognitive Decline,"" a review published online in American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR). Author Cyrus Raji, M.D., Ph.D., of UCLA and an international team suggest a framework in which neuroradiologists work as part of a team of clinical neuroscientists (neurologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, etc.) to apply quantitative neuroradiology towards prevention of cognitive decline in populations at high risk for dementia -- namely those with lifestyle, genetic, and other associated risk factors.\n\n""I believe neuroradiology, and especially quantitative MRI technology, will have a huge impact in the future of diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer\'s disease, since there is compelling evidence for the baseline size of hippocampus as a key determinant of risk for future cognitive decline, and since many lifestyle factors can cause atrophy or expansion in the volume of this critical brain structure,"" says neurologist Majid Fotuhi, M.D., Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSuch work is already happening at UCLA and other institutions that meld these approaches into novel ways to improve patient care. ""We are working closely with neuroradiologists to redefine how we can reduce risk for Alzheimer\'s with quantitative neuroimaging that helps us pinpoint symptom-relevant volume loss in the brain and subsequent targets for tracking our lifestyle-based interventions,"" says Dr. David Merrill, a geriatric psychiatrist at UCLA Medical Center.\n\n""Recent advances have improved the ability to characterize imaging markers along the trajectory of Alzheimers disease, starting in the pre-clinical phase. These markers, including structural, functional, and molecular imaging are being used in the AD diagnositc criteria [AA/NIA], (1)"" says Howard Aizenstein, M.D., Ph.D., a psychiatrist at University of Pittsburgh.\n\nFotuhi sees imaging findings as a unique motivator for patients to make positive lifestyle changes. ""Patients seem to enjoy reviewing results of their imaging studies, more so than reading the results of their blood tests or other clinical evaluations. For example, they can see with their own eyes whether there are any strokes or atrophy in their brain. This can have a powerful impact on them and on their determination to make changes in their lifestyle in order to improve their brain health,"" he adds.\n\nAmong the lifestyle and risk factors that can be altered to potentially prevent cognitive declines are obesity, diet, sleep, hypertension, diabetes, depression, supplementation, smoking and physical activity. It is estimated that as many as 3 million cases of Alzheimer\'s dementia worldwide can be prevented with as little as a 10% reduction in the burden of preventable lifestyle.

NSAIDs also include prescription medicines called COX-2 enzyme inhibitors, such as Celebrex (celecoxib).\n\n""Our study showed that users of common painkillers, known as NSAIDs, have a lower risk of the three major types of skin cancer, [including] malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma,"" said study lead author, Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir, at the department of clinical epidemiology at Aarhus University Hospital in Aarhus, Denmark.\n\n""The greatest effect,"" she noted, ""was found for squamous cell carcinomas and malignant melanoma, especially when [these painkillers were] taken frequently and over a long time period.""\n\nThe study appears in the May 29 online issue of the journal Cancer.\n\nThe authors noted that prior work supported the notion that NSAIDs may offer some measure of protection against cancer (most notably colorectal cancer), by specifically impeding the cancer-causing activities of COX-2 (cyclooxygenase) enzymes.\n\nHowever, the team suggested that past investigations into how NSAIDs may affect skin cancer risk, in particular, had key design problems that undercut efforts to nail down any NSAID-skin cancer connection.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers analyzed prescription databases and health information registries including the Danish Cancer Registry and the Danish Civil Registration System.\n\nThe team focused on diagnostic and death records concerning nearly 2,000 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, about 13,300 cases of basal cell carcinoma and nearly 3,250 cases of malignant melanoma diagnosed between 1991 and 2009 when the patients were at least 20 years old.\n\nIn turn, prescription histories were gathered for both the cancer patient group and almost 179,000 healthy Danes. Records covered the use of both low- and high-dose aspirin (ranging from 75 milligrams to 500 milligrams), so-called ""nonselective"" NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen [Advil] and naproxen [Aleve]), and both older and newer types of COX-2 inhibitors. Researchers noted the number of prescriptions issued per patient and their length of use, with short-term use defined as fewer than seven years.\n\nThe result: The relative risk for squamous cell carcinoma was found to have dropped by 15 percent among those Danes who had filled more than two NSAID prescriptions, compared to those who had filled two or less.\n\nSimilarly, malignant melanoma risk fell by nearly as much (13 percent) among those filling more than two NSAID prescriptions.\n\nHowever, the same dynamic was generally not seen with regards to basal cell carcinoma. But taking NSAIDs for long periods of time, and at relatively high doses, was associated with a reduced risk (between 15 and 21 percent), specifically for basal cell cases that manifested in skin regions that typically experience relatively little sun exposure (areas other than the neck or head).\n\nOn that front, long-term users and those who took NSAIDs at relatively higher doses appeared to benefit from the strongest protective effect, suggesting that when it comes to skin cancer risk reduction, more NSAID use is better.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that the NSAID-cancer connection could be affected by a range of lifestyle factors they did not account for, such as an individual\'s specific skin type or sun exposure patterns.\n\nBut Johannesdottir added that ""we hope that our finding will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention. Also, the potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use,"" she noted.\n\nHowever, ""other studies need to detail the association further and to examine benefits versus risks,"" she cautioned. ""Meanwhile, the most important prevention against skin cancer remains sun protection.""\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. William Ting, a private practice dermatologist in San Ramon, Calif., praised the study despite agreeing that many factors are at play when it comes to skin cancer formation.\n\n""Now we have a better understanding that inflammation also plays a significant role in cancer formation and even skin cancers,"" he said.\n\nAnd, ""this exciting article gives physicians and consumers a relatively simple way of diminishing one\'s risk of skin cancer by doing what most of us are doing already for heart health,"" Ting added. Ting also advised that people consult with their doctor before starting on any blood thinner.\n\nWhile the study found an association between skin cancer risk and NSAIDs, it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on NSAIDs and cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']","Four stars but with some notable flaws. This story pumps up the notion that “more NSAID use is better” for skin cancer prevention, but doesn’t mention well known harms – and – except for the final line, inappropriately uses cause-and-effect language throughout.","This is another one of those stories that will leave readers’ heads spinning. In the opening sentence, we learn that takings NSAIDs “appears to significantly lower the risk for developing several major forms of skin cancer.” And throughout the story, there is reinforcement of the message that higher-dose users “appeared to benefit from the strongest protective effect.” But then in the last sentence, the story seems to take it all back by claiming that the study “did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship” between NSAIDs and cancer.
So which part of the story should we believe — the part that consistently uses cause-and-effect language to describe the relationship between NSAIDs and skin cancer, or the out-of-context line at the end that tells us there was no such relationship? The message would have been a lot clearer if the story had avoided using cause-and-effect language– “may help prevent”…”lowers risk”…”appeared to benefit” — throughout.
The absence of discussion of harm is a second major drawback.

Hot flashes, night sweats, moodiness, foggy thinking — all can be part of the menopausal package.\n\nAt first blush, the solution seems obvious: Take extra hormones, and the symptoms of menopause should vanish. Over the decades, millions of women have taken some form of hormone therapy to relieve symptoms of menopause or to prevent the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis. The treatment typically included Premarin, estrogen isolated from the urine of pregnant mares, combined with Provera, a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone.\n\nBut when a six-year study of more than 16,600 postmenopausal women that was part of the Women’s Health Initiative found that the combination of Premarin and Provera seemed to increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke and heart disease, doctors and patients suddenly had to consider other options.\n\nSoon after the WHI made headlines, some pharmacies, alternative health clinics and a few outspoken doctors started heavily promoting so-called “bioidentical hormones” for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Unlike Premarin or Provera, bioidentical hormones — which are produced in laboratories using yam and soy phytoestrogens as a starting point — exactly match the hormone made by human ovaries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved several prescription-only drugs that contain bioidentical hormones, including Estrace pills, Estrasorb topical cream and the Alora patch. But many health clinics and pharmacies also sell non-approved creams that contain bioidentical estrogen and/or progesterone. These creams are often custom-made — or “compounded” — for each patient, sometimes based on the results of a saliva test that measures a woman’s hormone levels.\n\nDr. Kent Holtorf, a physician and proponent of bioidentical hormones who offers the treatments at his Holtorf Medical Group clinics in Torrance and Foster City, Calif., says a month’s supply of a compounded estrogen costs about $25, about one-sixth the cost of an FDA-approved prescription cream.\n\nNon-prescription bioidentical creams are also sold online. Better Health Naturally sells a 2-ounce jar of its Menopause Moisture Cream for $21. Users are instructed to apply 1/4 teaspoon of cream twice a day to the skin for 25 days straight, take a break for three to five days, then start the cycle again.\n\nClaims: The website for Holtorf’s clinic says that women using bioidentical hormones “feel great” without suffering any of the side effects of “synthetic hormones,” said to include fatigue, depression and weight gain, along with the increased risk of breast cancer and heart disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a phone interview, Holtorf said that bioidentical hormones are more effective and safer than traditional treatments. “Over and over, women have told me that they feel much better” after taking the bioidentical hormones, he says.\n\nThe Better Health Naturally website says that its menopause cream will treat hot flashes, night sweats, depression, lack of sex drive and fuzzy thinking. The site emphasizes that the cream doesn’t contain “risky synthetic estrogens and progestins.”\n\nThe bottom line: Bioidentical hormones have an obvious appeal to women seeking relief for menopausal symptoms, says Dr. Nanette Santoro, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver and vice president of clinical science for the Endocrine Society. After all, it just seems to make sense that anything that exactly mimics a woman’s own hormones must be better than mare’s urine or a man-made compound that doesn’t exist in nature.\n\nBut Santoro says there is no proof that bioidentical hormones are any safer or more effective than traditional treatments. “All of the evidence that we have suggests that all of these hormones should be painted with the same brush,” she says.\n\nShe has many concerns about bioidentical hormones that don’t have FDA approval. For one thing, she says, it’s impossible to know if unapproved creams have the promised amounts of hormones. “I’ve seen patients on these compounds actually losing bone mass because they were getting an insufficient dosage,” she says. “Why take that chance?”\n\nDr. Cynthia Stuenkel, clinical professor of medicine at UC San Diego and president of the North American Menopause Society, shares this concern. “Some progesterone creams may contain little or no progesterone, while others contain so much that they definitely should be available only with a prescription,” she says.\n\nTaking hormones without the careful guidance of a doctor is risky business, Stuenkel says. Among other things, too many hormones can potentially cause blood clots and endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor to uterine cancer.\n\nHoltorf says there is strong evidence that bioidentical hormones are superior to other hormone treatments. In 2009, he published a review article in the journal Postgraduate Medicine that described dozens of studies of bioidentical hormones, many with positive results. And he notes that a survey of 176 postmenopausal women published in 2000 found that 65% said that bioidentical progesterone worked better than the hormone found in Provera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Nothing is ever proven in medicine,” he says. “You just try to look at the evidence and find the best treatment for your patient.” (He adds that he’s not yet convinced that the saliva tests offered at many clinics are a good measure of a woman’s hormonal needs.)\n\nHoltorf claims that doubters of bioidentical hormones are generally either slow to accept change or are tainted by funding from the pharmaceutical industry. But Stuenkel counters that she and other physicians are simply following the evidence. Although some FDA-approved bioidentical hormones may, in fact, be improvements over traditional treatments, she says, the unapproved products have never been carefully studied. She points out that the biodentical progesterone used in the 2000 survey was almost certainly an FDA-approved product, not a compounded hormone put together in some clinic or pharmacy.\n\nStuenkel says that doctors paid close attention to the results from the Women’s Health Initiative, a powerful study with a huge size and scope. By using smaller doses and different methods of delivery, they are continuing to give women safe relief from menopause symptoms without resorting to unapproved and untested treatments, she adds. “We have women’s best interest at heart,” she says.\n\nhealth@latimes.com\n\nCurious about a consumer health product?

","Bio-identical hormone therapy is a poorly-defined term for using a set of hormones that are molecularly identical to natural hormones in the body. Proponents of this treatment claim that bio-identical hormones are safer and more effective than conventional hormone therapy for treating the symptoms of menopause, however there is no evidence to support these claims. Furthermore, hormones are expected to have the same risk and benefits as approved drugs for which there is an evidence base as well as extensive research and regulation. Many medical organizations, both in the US and internationally, have issued statements raising concerns about the claims made about bio-identical hormones.
This story does a good job of raising awareness about this issue, although it should have noted that many women don’t experience symptoms in the same way and that treatment with bio-identical hormones or traditional hormones should only be used by women who are bothered by their symptoms and not if they are trying to prevent heart disease.
The story could have been greatly improved by coming down harder on the proponents of bio-identical hormones. While the story includes a debate on whether there is evidence to support the use of bio-identical hormones, in doing so, it gives the impression that there really is a debate. Bio-identical hormone supporters claim that there have been dozens of clinical trials showing a benefit. However, a 2007 systematic review found ""a dearth of scientific evidence to support these claims"". The story should have been more critical of the evidence base to support the use of bio-identical hormones.

The first version arrived in 2007, developed by the namesake company in Fremont, Calif. A second-generation commercial version came out in October 2009.\n\nA recent morning found Moore gearing up for his twice-weekly, 25-minute workout on the machine during his regular therapy session at The Suites at Holly Creek, a retirement community and assisted-living facility in Centennial where he spent several weeks before returning to his practice.\n\nHe was assisted by Jennifer Lo, Holly Creek’s director of rehabilitation.\n\nAt $25,000, the AlterG is expensive, but the technology is simple. Compressed air is pumped into a plastic chamber over the treadmill, creating “lift.” The patient is sealed from the waist down inside the chamber, and a computer panel allows patients to take up to 80 percent of their body weight off their joints.\n\nSo a 200-pound man can wind up effectively feeling like he weighs only 40 pounds — a real boon when you’re trying to rehab shattered shins, as Moore is.\n\nGearing up\n\nAt first glance, Moore looked like he was gearing up for a deep-sea dive.\n\nStep 1 was getting into a pair of neoprene shorts topped with a stiff reinforced fabric that encircled his waist. This ring contained a zipper that, when Moore stepped onto the treadmill, was attached to another zipper, forming a seal.\n\nAir was pumped in, and Lo programmed the AlterG to let Moore walk at 68 percent of his 205-pound body weight. His legs were effectively supporting a 139-pound man. Moore, who still limps badly 9 1/2 months after the accident, started walking with alacrity — no trace of hobbling at all.\n\n“The thing about this machine is that when patients get in here and offload their weight by 30 or 40 percent, they can resume their normal gait,” Lo said. “And they’re not just working their legs, they’re getting a cardio workout too.”\n\nAs Moore walked on the treadmill, he marveled at what it allows him to do.\n\n“I’m walking as fast as I did before the accident,” said Moore, 66. “I’m walking as normal as I did a year ago.”\n\nWhen his session ended, the machine’s whirring stopped and the plastic bubble encasing his lower body deflated. Moore stepped onto the carpeted floor and took a few halting steps toward the leg brace he wears.\n\n“Now here I am back in real life,” he said.\n\nThere are only a few of the 750-pound units in the area.\n\nThe Suites at Clermont Park uses them. Ditto for Mountain View Physical Therapy in Evergreen, Azura Senior Living in Boulder and the Life Care Center of Littleton. Mountain View’s AlterG is available to the general public, and athletes sometimes rent time on it to do speed work and interval training.\n\nKnee, back rehab\n\n“We use it a lot for patients doing post-surgical rehab for their knees and backs,” says Valerie Gluth, a physical therapist and Mountain View’s owner. “It lets people walk with a normal gait so they don’t develop bad habits that lead to other orthopedic problems. A limp is easy to develop and hard to get rid of.”\n\nElite distant runners such as Dathan Ritzenhein and Shannon Rowbury have used the AlterG, and professional sports teams such as the Los Angeles Lakers and England’s Manchester United soccer club have used the machines. They’re also used at Walter Reed Army Medical Center to treat injured soldiers and at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.\n\n“The AlterG treadmill is an excellent rehabilitation device,” Rowbury said. “It was a huge asset to me when I was recovering from a stress fracture in my hip because it allowed me to reintroduce running in a safe, low-impact environment. I could gradually build up my strength so that when my bone was healed enough to tolerate full-body- weight running, my muscles were strong enough to support me.”\n\nThe machines are also used to help obese patients — not just for training, but in giving them incentive by showing them how their feet and knees would feel better if they lost, say, 100 pounds.\n\n“I think they’re going to be everywhere with rehab units, and with recreational and elite athletes too,” said Lo, who is a trail runner and competitive ultra- marathoner in her off hours.\n\nWilliam Porter: 303-954-1877 or wporter@denverpost.com']","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">This story glorifies a high-tech weight-supporting treadmill used by people recovering from injuries or surgery without subjecting it to any sort of critical evaluation.<br/>

 The story doesn’t compare the new gee-whiz technology to alternatives, such as exercising in a swimming pool – leading oneline news reader to comment, “You can do the same thing in any swimming pool and get a better workout.” The story misrepresents the available research evidence. It is vague about benefits and silent about potential harms. It mentions cost, but not in a way that is useful to readers. The story invokes the NASA-linked origins of the concept underlying the Alter-G device, but it is like a report that extols the wonders of Tang without acknowledging the existence of orange juice.

All are probably still viable treatment options, but what we don\'t know is what each particular patient will need,"" Bronfort said, adding that it\'s possible a combination of treatments might be helpful, too.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Jan. 3 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. Funding for the study was provided by the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\n\nNeck pain is an extremely common problem. About three-quarters of adults report having neck pain at some point in their lives, according to background information in the study. Neck pain is responsible for millions of health care visits each year, and it can have a negative impact on quality of life.\n\nSpinal manipulation is one type of treatment that\'s offered for neck pain, and it can be administered by chiropractors, physical therapists, osteopaths and other health care providers, according to the study.\n\nBut, there isn\'t much evidence for treating neck pain with spinal manipulation. There also isn\'t a great deal of information on how effective medications or home exercise programs are for treating neck pain, the researchers noted.\n\nBronfort and colleagues thought that spinal manipulation might prove to be more effective than medications or home exercise therapy. To test their hypothesis, they recruited 272 people between the ages of 18 and 65 who had neck pain. Their neck pain had no known cause, such as a trauma or pinched nerve, and the patients been experiencing the pain for between two and 12 weeks when the study began.\n\nThe study volunteers were randomly selected for one of three treatment groups. One group received spinal manipulations over a 12-week period. Each individual was allowed to choose the number of spinal manipulations they felt they needed.\n\nThe second group received medications, both over the counter and prescription, depending on their needs. First-line medications included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or acetaminophen (Tylenol). If people didn\'t get relief from these drugs, narcotic pain medications and muscle relaxants were offered.\n\nThe third group was assigned two one-hour sessions of home exercise. The goal of the home-exercise program was to improve movement in the neck area. Participants were instructed to do the exercises six to eight times per day.\n\nAt the 12th week, 82 percent of people receiving spinal manipulation reported at least a 50 percent reduction in pain, compared with 69 percent of those on medication and 77 percent doing home exercises. Also at week 12, of people receiving spinal manipulation, 32 percent reported feeling a 100 percent reduction in pain, compared with 13 percent on medications and 30 percent doing home exercises.\n\nAt one year, 27 percent of those receiving spinal manipulation said they felt a 100 percent reduction in pain versus 17 percent of those on medications and 37 percent of those doing home exercises.\n\n""For me, as an ER doctor, this study offers an interesting perspective,"" said Dr. Robert Glatter, an attending physician in emergency medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""It\'s a small study, but it found that home exercises and spinal manipulation were effective. So, should we be referring to physical therapists, osteopaths or chiropractors from the ER?""\n\n""This study shows that basically neck pain will get better on its own,"" said Dr. Victor Khabie, chief of the departments of surgery and sports medicine at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. ""It would\'ve been good if they had a no-treatment group, too,"" he added.\n\n""Everyone heals differently. There are different pathways to healing, and whether you feel you\'re better off with chiropractic, home exercises or medications, this study shows that all three are basically just as effective. Whatever your pathway to healing, in about six to eight weeks, you should start to feel better,"" said Khabie.\n\nHe also noted that it\'s important for anyone receiving spinal manipulation to know that there are rare, but serious risks that can occur with neck manipulations.\n\nAll three experts said anyone experiencing neck pain needs to have it evaluated to make sure there isn\'t a serious or correctable cause of the pain. This is especially true if you\'ve been in a car accident, or if you have any neurological symptoms, such as repeatedly dropping things, or if you have pain radiating down your arm.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about neck pain, its causes and treatment from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']",This story about a neck-to-neck comparison of treatments clearly states the main findings. It includes good context and independent sources.,"When researchers randomized 272 neck pain patients to receive either spinal manipulation, medication, or instructions on home exercises, they found some differences that were statistically significant. But the big picture is that all the patients tended to get better and those who got manipulation or home exercise instructions fared about the same. And that the bottom line message that readers get from the news story.

Less obvious symptoms include depression, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.\n\nNeurological disorders that mimic the symptoms of Parkinson\'s disease are called atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nMany doctors cannot tell whether a patient has Parkinson\'s disease or atypical parkinsonism.\n\n""This can be very challenging, especially during the early stages of the diseases and if the responsible doctor is not a neurologist specialized in movement disorders,"" said Dr. Oskar Hansson, lead author of the new study, a neurologist and an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nNon-specialists ""do not really know exactly what questions to ask the patient and the special signs to look for,"" Hansson wrote in an email. Yet patients with atypical disorders ""usually have a much worse prognosis, with faster disease progression, (with) more disabling symptoms"" than Parkinson\'s patients, so early identification is crucial.\n\nThe correct diagnosis is also key to treatment since ""most patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders do not respond well to dopamine-targeting medications"" that are usually prescribed for Parkinson\'s patients, Hansson said.\n\nValidating a new biomarker\n\nHansson and his colleagues developed a blood test that is, essentially, a variation on an existing test capable of detecting neurofilament light chain protein in spinal fluid. This protein is a component of nerve cells, and when these cells die, it can be detected in both spinal fluid and blood.\n\nBecause spinal fluid is not easily obtained by a primary care doctor, this diagnostic test is not very useful, so Hansson developed a blood test and investigated its accuracy in the new study.\n\nWhen validating a new biomarker for disease, ""one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible,"" said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics.\n\nAll told, a total of 244 people with Parkinson\'s and 79 healthy volunteers serving as a comparison group participated in Hansson\'s study, along with 181 patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nOf these, 88 patients had multiple system atrophy, which impairs the body\'s involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.\n\nSeventy patients had progressive supranuclear palsy, which affects movement, walking, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, mood and thinking.\n\nAnd 23 patients had corticobasal degeneration, which causes decreased movement on one side of the body, muscle rigidity, tremor and a disconnection between thought and action.\n\nTesting these participants, the researchers found that nerve protein levels ranged higher in people with atypical parkinsonism and lower in patients with Parkinson\'s disease as well as the healthy volunteers. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose.\n\nBlood test accuracy is defined based on sensitivity, the percentage of positives that are correctly identified, and specificity, the percentage of negatives that are correctly identified. In Sweden, the blood test had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 91%, while in the United Kingdom, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 90%. For early-stage study participants, generally, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 80%.\n\nOverall, the blood test showed equal accuracy as the spinal fluid test when diagnosing Parkinson\'s or an atypical parkinsonism disorder, in both early and later stages of disease.\n\nHansson imagines that blood-based tests will be used in the future ""in the diagnostic work-up of patients with parkinsonism by most doctors who are not very specialized with these movement disorders."" He also believes the test will be used by specialists for Parkinson\'s patients who ""do not exhibit a very typical symptomatology"" or do not respond as expected to treatment.\n\nMisdiagnosis is common\n\nThe prevalence of Parkinson\'s in the general population increases from about 1% at age 60 to 4% by age 80, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . ""Atypical parkinsonism disorders are not as common as Parkinson\'s disease,"" said Dr. Jeff Bronstein, a professor of neurology and director of movement disorders at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He was not involved in the new study.\n\nUsually, patients are first diagnosed with Parkinson\'s, and only later do their doctors discover that they have one of the more rare neurodegenerative atypical parkinsonism disorders, which are most likely to affect people in their 50s and 60s and represent approximately 10% to 20% of all cases originally diagnosed as Parkinson\'s\n\nThough atypical parkinsonism conditions look very similar to Parkinson\'s at first, they ""have a different underlying molecular cause,"" according to Bronstein, and so it is important to recognize them early in order to treat them properly. ""Disease-specific therapies are now in trials, so accurate diagnosis is essential in determining if these new treatments work,"" he said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases.\n\n""A lot of time, people come in and say they or a family member has a tremor, and they believe it\'s Parkinson\'s disease,"" said Wright, who also was not involved in the study. This early assumption may impede diagnosis of a less recognized atypical parkinsonism condition.\n\nOr a patient has ""horrible blood pressure fluctuations,"" Wright said, and no obvious tremor or rigidity symptoms, so a doctor suspects a heart condition. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.\n\nAn accurate blood test, then, would be good news in these situations.\n\n""It\'s a lot more reassuring to a patient to say \'we\'re just going to take a blood test to check for a few things,\' "" Wright said. ""It\'s much easier and less anxiety-provoking for patients than taking a spinal tap.""\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nUp until now, many diseases have been diagnosed based on symptoms, with patients asking, ""How do you know I have this?"" Meanwhile, doctors are not always correct, Wright said. This is true even of Parkinson\'s, which is diagnosed based on symptoms, a patient\'s history, neurological exams, a patient\'s response to medicine and, in some cases, brain imaging tests.\n\nStill, Wright is hopeful and believes a biomarker test for Parkinson\'s ""will be down the line. ... In general, researchers are looking for biomarkers of disease.""\n\nSpecialists and sub-specialists are available only in big cities, Wright said, and access to a simple blood test would enable a correct diagnosis in a primary care office.\n\n""We always assume there\'s luxury,"" Wright said. ""But that\'s not really what\'s real in most of the country.""']","Readers of this story will be given a mostly thorough, non-hyped account of what a new study found.","This CNN story describes the results of a newly published study designed to see if a protein that can be measured in a blood sample accurately distinguishes between Parkinson’s Disease and a group of a rarer — but generally more rapidly disabling — disorders with similar neuromotor symptoms.
The article earns good marks for efforts to educate readers about the challenges of correctly diagnosing movement disorders and what the stakes are for patients who may get inadequate or overzealous treatment for the wrong condition. It also was detailed about the false-positive and false-negatives rates for the test–an important detail not often included in stories about screening tests.

Results from MERCURY PE, which evaluated the benefits of treating patients with low-risk PE with XARELTO® and discharging them early from the emergency department to complete treatment at home, were published in Academic Emergency Medicine.\n\nClick to Tweet: New study shows out-patient use of Janssen #bloodthinner results in cost savings and reduces time in hospital for low-risk PE patients https://ctt.ac/RZ2ka+\n\n""Every year, U.S. health care systems spend more than two billion dollars to manage patients with pulmonary emboli,"" said principal study investigator W. Frank Peacock, MD, FACEP, FACC, Associate Chair and Research Director, Emergency Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. ""By avoiding hospitalizations that are not clinically necessary and transitioning patients with low-risk PE to out-patient treatment with XARELTO®, we\'ve seen significant cost savings, which could help alleviate the burden on health care systems.""\n\n\n\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in a deep vein, and PE, a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot travels to the lung. Of the approximately 900,000 Americans who experience a VTE each yeari, more than 250,000 are diagnosed with PE in the emergency departmentii. Hospitals across the United States have varying protocols for managing PE, but standard of care typically requires people to be admitted for treatment, which drives up costs and substantially increases hospital-acquired conditions and infectionsiii,iv. While people with more severe PE have higher mortality rates, the 30-day mortality rate of low-risk PE is less than one percentv.\n\nClick to Tweet: Patients taking Janssen blood thinner say in a new study that out-patient treatment is less burdensome than the standard of care https://ctt.ac/W41cS+\n\nMERCURY PE met its primary efficacy endpoint, with XARELTO® leading to significantly reduced time in the hospital due to VTE or bleeding within 30 days after randomization compared with the standard of care (mean duration of 4.8 vs. 33.6 hours, respectively; 95% CI; p<0.0001). The mean difference of length of stay between the two groups was 28.8 hours. Of note, there was no recurrence of VTE or VTE-related death or any significant differences in the bleeding-related hospitalizations or physician visits within 90 days from randomization in either group, though this outcome should be interpreted with caution, as the study was significantly underpowered to detect any such differences.\n\n""We\'re proud to have pioneered this groundbreaking research, which was the first prospective randomized trial to confirm the benefit of discharging patients with low-risk PE early from the hospital and completing treatment at home,"" said Paul Burton, MD, PhD, FACC, Vice President, Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC. ""We expect that this XARELTO® study will prompt physicians to reconsider how patients with low-risk PE are managed.""\n\nAbout MERCURY-PE\n\nPatients with low-risk PE were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to open label XARELTO® or standard of care within 12 hours of diagnosis. Patients randomized to XARELTO® were discharged from the emergency department within 24 hours and were instructed to take XARELTO® 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, then XARELTO® 20 mg once daily until the study was completed. Patients randomized to standard of care were treated per local hospital protocol, which could include hospitalization and any U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anticoagulant strategy, including XARELTO®.\n\nResearchers also made the following observations about XARELTO® in this setting:\n\nThe mean length of initial and subsequent hospitalizations for any reason was shorter for patients who were discharged early on XARELTO ® within 90 days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care (p=0.024; 19.2 hours vs. 43.2 hours, respectively).\n\nwithin 90 days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care (p=0.024; 19.2 hours vs. 43.2 hours, respectively). There was no major bleeding in either group within 90 days from randomization, although two patients reported clinically relevant non-major bleeding, one in each group. There were no deaths due to bleeding in the study.\n\nOverall, early discharge on XARELTO® was markedly less expensive than standard of care. The cost associated with the emergency room visit and any subsequent hospitalization at the time of PE diagnosis and the total costs were $2,638 (p<0.001) and $2,496 (p<0.001) less with XARELTO®.\n\nMERCURY PE builds on prior research, including a June 2015 study published in Academic Emergency Medicine showing that 106 patients with low-risk PE or DVT, when prescribed XARELTO® and immediately discharged, had no recurrent events while on therapy. Additionally, no major or clinically relevant bleeding events were observed. A companion study found patients with low-risk PE or DVT who were prescribed XARELTO® had significantly lower medical costs than those admitted and given standard treatment.\n\nThe clinical and economic benefits demonstrated in the MERCURY-PE trial have been confirmed in more than 3,100 U.S. patients in a real-world study, showing that XARELTO® resulted in a significant one-day reduction in hospital length of stay and significantly lower total healthcare costs (approximately $2,000).\n\nMERCURY PE Patient Satisfaction Results\n\nPatient satisfaction, both with out-patient and in-patient care, was also analyzed using Likert scales and the Anti-Clot Treatment Score (ACTS). On the Likert scales, most patients in both groups indicated they were ""very satisfied"" with their care, but numerically more patients taking XARELTO® preferred to receive outpatient care (50 percent) compared to slightly less than half of patients receiving in-patient standard of care (47.5 percent). The ACTS measured the patient\'s perspective on the burden of treatment, with more patients taking XARELTO® reporting it was ""not at all"" burdensome compared to those receiving standard of care (64.4 percent vs. 54.4 percent).\n\nAbout MERCURY PE\n\nMERCURY PE was a randomized, open label, parallel-group, multicenter trial conducted at 35 hospitals across the U.S. Adult patients who arrived at the emergency department with confirmed, low-risk PE (defined by the absence of any Hestia criteria) were eligible for enrollment. Of the 114 patients randomized, 99 completed the study (44 in the XARELTO® group and 55 in the standard of care group). Patients who did not complete the study were mainly lost to follow-up or adverse events. Analyses were conducted by intention-to-treat basis, regardless of the anticoagulant used.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome was the total amount of time spent in the hospital (in hours) for VTE or bleeding events in the 30 days after randomization. Hospital readmissions for reasons unrelated to VTE were excluded. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding within 90 days. Secondary efficacy endpoints included 90-day rates of new/recurrent VTE, VTE-related death, unplanned hospital or physician office visits for VTE or bleeding, total length of initial or subsequent hospitalizations for any reason, patient-reported satisfaction, and total costs of care. A secondary safety endpoint was clinically relevant non-major bleeding based on International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definitions.\n\nMERCURY PE also had a few limitations, including sample size (study enrolled 114 of a planned 300 patients), exclusion bias based on subjective evaluation of hemodynamic stability and ability to adhere to protocol, and potential bias due to inability to blind patients to their admission status.\n\nAbout EXPLORER\n\nMERCURY PE is part of the EXPLORER program, which is unmatched by any oral anticoagulant in the Factor Xa inhibitor class in its size, scope and ambition. A collaborative effort between Janssen and its development partner Bayer, EXPLORER seeks to generate important clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of XARELTO® and its potential role in addressing critical unmet medical needs. A number of the studies in the program are designed to seek additional indications or expand the label for XARELTO® to benefit more patients in need of additional therapies for their cardiovascular disease. By the time of its completion, more than 275,000 patients will have participated in the EXPLORER clinical development program, other completed and ongoing clinical trials, investigative registries and non-interventional studies.\n\nWHAT IS XARELTO®?\n\nXARELTO® (rivaroxaban) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. For patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how XARELTO® and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.\n\nXARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months.\n\nXARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had knee or hip replacement surgery.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWhat is the most important information I should know about XARELTO® (rivaroxaban)?\n\nFor people taking XARELTO® for atrial fibrillation:\n\nPeople with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO® lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO®, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.\n\nDo not stop taking XARELTO® without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO® increases your risk of having a stroke.\n\nIf you have to stop taking XARELTO®, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.\n\nXARELTO® can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. This is because XARELTO® is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that reduces blood clotting. While you take XARELTO® you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.\n\nYou may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO® and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:\n\nAspirin or aspirin-containing products\n\n\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\n\n\nWarfarin sodium (Coumadin ® , Jantoven ® )\n\n, Jantoven )\n\nAny medicine that contains heparin\n\n\n\nClopidogrel (Plavix ® )\n\n)\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\n\n\nOther medicines to prevent or treat blood clots\n\nTell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.\n\nCall your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding:\n\nUnexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:\n\nNosebleeds that happen often\n\n\n\nUnusual bleeding from gums\n\n\n\nMenstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal, or vaginal bleeding\n\nBleeding that is severe or you cannot control\n\nRed, pink, or brown urine\n\nBright red or black stools (looks like tar)\n\nCough up blood or blood clots\n\nVomit blood or your vomit looks like ""coffee grounds""\n\nHeadaches, feeling dizzy or weak\n\nPain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites\n\nSpinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma): People who take a blood thinner medicine like XARELTO ® , and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis).

The news release is about a study that explores if patients with pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in the lungs, who are at low risk for complications can be sent home from the emergency department early rather than be admitted to hospital. The patients were divided into two groups: One group of patients were sent home early while taking rivaroxaban (Xarelto), a type of blood thinner, whereas the “usual care” group could get any blood thinner of their physician’s choosing, including rivaroxaban, and hospitalization.
The study findings suggest that early discharge of low-risk patients was safe and feasible and also resulted in cost savings because of less time spent in hospital. Unfortunately, the news release seemed to suggest that it was the use of rivaroxaban that resulted in cost savings–rather than the strategy of sending low risk patients home early. The news release failed to state was that over half the patients in the comparison group who got usual care also received rivaroxaban.
In other words, the news release implies that rivaroxaban was being compared to other anti-coagulants when what was actually being compared was an early vs. late discharge strategy.

REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn\n\nSmokers who took the pill, sold as Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere, were much more likely to quit after cutting back on cigarettes than smokers who didn’t use the drug, the study found.\n\n“This allows us to reach a much broader population of smokers who aren’t willing to quit abruptly or set a quit date, and it shows that people can quit without going cold turkey,” said lead study author Dr. Jon Ebbert, a professor in primary care and internal medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “This is very strong support for changing clinical practice to include gradual reduction aided by medication.”\n\nSmoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And tobacco kills one in 10 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nQuitting can reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus and bladder. Ten years after quitting, the risk of lung cancer drops by half, according to the CDC.\n\nTo see if Chantix, which is manufactured by Pfizer, could help smokers quit without going cold turkey, Ebbert and colleagues randomly assigned 1,510 people at 61 centers in 10 countries to receive either the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks.\n\nThey asked study participants to reduce cigarette use by 50 percent by the fourth week, and by 75 percent by the eight week, with the goal of quitting by week 12.\n\nBy the last ten weeks of treatment, weeks 15 to 24, the group taking the pill had significantly higher abstinence rates than the group on placebo.\n\nThis held true even after treatment stopped. For weeks 21 through 52 of the study, 27 percent of the people who had previously taken the drug successfully avoided smoking, compared with less than 10 percent of those who received the placebo.\n\n“This is the first study of its kind to enroll a group of smokers who are not traditionally enrolled in clinical trials because they are not ready to quit,” said Dr. Caryn Lerman, professor of psychiatry and deputy director of the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\n\n“It offers compelling evidence that gradual reduction should be considered to facilitate quitting,” she said.\n\nBut even though the approach helped some hard-to-reach smokers, the majority of them still failed to quit, noted Lerman, who wasn’t involved in the study. Other treatments, such as nicotine patches and gum, can also help some smokers cut back gradually, she said.\n\nWhile the study shows that Chantix, which is known generically as varenicline, can be effective for some smokers, the group taking the pill also experienced more side effects such as nausea, abnormal dreams, insomnia, constipation, vomiting, and weight gain.\n\nPrevious research has linked Chantix to side effects including suicidal thoughts, erratic behavior and drowsiness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration placed a black box warning - its most severe and restrictive warning - on the product in 2009, highlighting the drug’s adverse neuropsychological effects.\n\nPeople with a history of major depressive or anxiety disorder, suicidal behavior, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, or psychosis were excluded from the study, published in the American Medical Association’s journal JAMA.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/19t0acc JAMA, online February 17, 2015.']","This story carefully characterized the participants enrolled in a Pfizer-sponsored smoking cessation study that involved the drug Chantix. And for that reason, we’d give it a slight edge over ","The story is an overview of a recent study that found the use of the smoking cessation drug Chantix (varenicline) increased the likelihood that smokers would be able to quit smoking, even if the drug treatment regimen was begun before the smoker had set a “quit date” for when they would stop smoking. The story is exceptionally strong at addressing both the quality of the evidence and the potential side effects of the drug. We wish it had addressed costs, delivered a truly independent perspective, and discussed similar medications that have been shown to offer some benefit.

There is evidence in the literature of some clinical testing of phosphatidic acid, a natural phospholipid, or fatty acid derivative of soy lecithin, used as a carrier for some experimental drugs, but it is the only active ingredient mentioned on the product website – and not at all in the release — and there is precious little information about other ingredients or costs anywhere.

(NASDAQ: ORMP), today announced positive top-line results from its Phase IIb study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its oral insulin capsule (ORMD-0801) in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study\'s primary objective, a significant reduction of weighted mean night-time glucose, was successfully achieved.\n\n""This demonstration of safe and effective oral insulin delivery represents a transformative event in the treatment of type 2 diabetes,"" said Nadav Kidron, Oramed CEO. ""We are delighted with the results and look forward to moving into Phase III trials.""\n\nThis US based double blind, 28 day, randomized study of 180 adult type 2 diabetic patients showed a statistically significant decrease in the primary endpoint, pooled night-time glucose mean percentage change of 6.47% from run-in, between placebo and active cohorts (p=0.0268). The study additionally demonstrated a good safety profile with no drug related serious adverse events.\n\n""These are very impressive results that confirm the efficacy of orally delivered intestinally absorbed insulin,"" said Dr. Michael Berelowitz, Head of Oramed\'s Scientific Advisory Board. ""The promise of this more physiological delivery system for insulin is the inhibition of hepatic glucose production, which was clearly demonstrated via the significant reduction in night-time glucose levels in patients who received ORMD-0801.""\n\nThe Company plans to present and publish more comprehensive data in the future.\n\nConference Call today, May 18, at 11:00 am Eastern Time\n\nOramed will host a conference call to discuss the study results.\n\nInterested parties may access the call at: +1-866-254-0808 (US) or +44-145-254-1003 (UK). Conference ID: 8327230\n\nAbout the Phase IIb Oral Insulin Study\n\nThe double-blind, randomized Phase IIb study of 180 patients with type 2 diabetes was initiated on June 30, 2015 and was conducted at 33 clinical sites in the United States under an IND that was approved by the FDA. The study was designed to generate data to assess the safety and efficacy of multiple oral bedtime doses of ORMD-0801 in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are inadequately controlled with diet and metformin. The study was comprised of three arms: placebo, ORMD-0801 16mg and ORMD-0801 24 mg. Patients were dosed before bed-time, and their night-time glucose levels (6 hours post dose) were continuously monitored.\n\nFor more information on the study, which does not form a part of this press release, see: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02496000?term=oramed&rank=5\n\nAbout ORMD-0801\n\nORMD-0801 has the potential to create a new paradigm in the treatment of diabetes by oral delivery of insulin at an earlier stage of treatment, potentially slowing disease progression and delaying or even eliminating late-stage complications. Orally administered insulin is expected to enhance patient compliance. In addition, intestinally absorbed-oral insulin mimics insulin\'s natural location and gradients in the body by first passing through the liver before entering the bloodstream.\n\nAbout Oramed Pharmaceuticals\n\nOramed Pharmaceuticals is a platform technology pioneer in the field of oral delivery solutions for drugs currently delivered via injection. Established in 2006, Oramed\'s Protein Oral Delivery (POD[TM]) technology is based on over 30 years of research by scientists at Jerusalem\'s Hadassah Medical Center.

He added it could lead to better and earlier detection of colon polyps.\n\nVirtual colonoscopy screening uses CT scans to create color, 3D images of the colon, the final portion of the large intestine. Special computer animation enables a doctor to view the organ in remarkable detail. Regular colonoscopy physically examines the colon by inserting a lighted probe into the intestine and requires a sedative. Both have made early detection and treatment more precise.\n\nThis next step in virtual colonoscopy, called ""immersive colonoscopy,"" projects 3D images of the colon large enough to fill the walls of a room. Doctors can then ""walk through"" the colon and explore many different angles.\n\n""We have the side view and the back view,"" said Kaufman. ""This will allow the physician to view 100 percent of the surface including lesions, which are hidden behind folds maybe seen on the side and back walls.""\n\nSuch highly specific screening may allow doctors to detect more abnormal growths, called polyps, when they are as small as .10 mm, so they can be removed before they become full-blown cancer tumors.\n\nFor the patient, a virtual colonoscopy is low risk but does involve additional exposure to radiation. It may need to be followed with the physical colonoscopy later, as well.\n\nColonoscopies are recommended for adults age 50 and over to help detect early signs of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death among the combined group of men and women who have cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe CDC says colonoscopy may also be recommended for people experiencing stomach pain, aches or cramps that don\'t go away, unexplained weight loss and blood in the stool. More routine DNA tests and stool sampling, which show signs of bleeding caused by irregular growths, can also help detect colon polyps and indicate that the need for a full colonoscopy.\n\nThe CDC says colonoscopy could reduce the number of colorectal cancer cases by as much as 60 percent. This new wave of radiology-based colonoscopy could improve those odds further.']","With sweeping, unsupported statements about the benefits of 3-D colonoscopies, this report reads more like a news release from a device company rather than an objective piece of health journalism.","A story on virtual colonoscopy — especially a colonoscopy that projects images on the wall so that the doctor can “walk through” your intestines — makes for a great television news segment because of the colorful, 3-D imagery accompanying flashy computer animations. But what’s missing from the CBS news report (and the accompanying video segment) is any evidence backing up the headline claim that this technology could “detect cancer earlier” or that it will reduce the number of colorectal cancer cases. It doesn’t cite any studies or solicit the opinions of independent experts. Instead, the only source in this piece is the inventor of the technology. There also isn’t any mention of costs or any discussion on the limitations of the procedure.

These infections are the most common reason why children are given antibiotics, the University of Pittsburgh researchers noted.\n\n""Given significant concerns regarding overuse of antibiotics and increased antibiotic resistance, we conducted this trial to see if reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment would be equally effective along with decreased antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse reactions,"" Dr. Alejandro Hoberman said in a university news release. Hoberman is chief of the general academic pediatrics division at Children\'s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.\n\nThe study included 520 youngsters with ear infections. The children ranged in age from 9 months to 23 months, and were randomly selected to receive either a standard 10-day course of antibiotics or a shortened five-day course of antibiotics followed by five days of placebos.\n\nThe risk of treatment failure was 34 percent in the five-day group and 16 percent in the 10-day group. What\'s more, the children in the five-day group didn\'t have a lower risk of antibiotic resistance or of side effects such as diarrhea or diaper rash.\n\n""The results of this study clearly show that for treating ear infections in children between 9 and 23 months of age, a five-day course of antibiotic offers no benefit in terms of adverse events or antibiotic resistance,"" Hoberman said.\n\n""Though we should be rightly concerned about the emergence of resistance overall for this condition, the benefits of the 10-day regimen greatly outweigh the risks,"" he added.\n\nThe study was published Dec. 21 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has more about ear infections in children.']","The more useful way to report on this study is not in isolation, but rather, by taking a step back and answering: How does it fit into the vast body of already published studies of antibiotic treatments of otitis media (ear aches)?","This news story about a study measuring longer versus shorter courses of antibiotics for younger children with ear infections lacks important detail, because it’s mostly just a shortened rehash of the news release.
For one, it doesn’t make it clear that research indicates that antibiotics seem more effective in younger kids versus older kids, and that’s why this study was focusing on this younger age group. Without this detail, it’s likely to leave parents with the wrong impression that treating all ear infections with longer courses of antibiotics is the right thing to do.
The story also didn’t adequately discuss the potential harms in prescribing antibiotics to children who don’t need them, as well as the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.

Sometimes the situation is truly life-threatening. But often the problem is that labor simply isn\'t progressing. That was the case for Valerie Echo Duckett, 35, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. After receiving an epidural for pain, Duckett\'s contractions stopped. By late evening she was told she\'d need a C-section to deliver her son, Avery. Duckett says she has vague memories of being wheeled into the operating room, strapped down and shaking from cold.\n\n""They were covering me up with warm blankets,""she says. ""I kind of slept in and out of it."" Her only memory of meeting her newborn son for the first time was from some pictures her husband took.\n\nI felt that I hadn\'t earned the right to say I gave birth to him.\n\nThis is the experience many women have. The cesarean section is the most common surgery in America — about 1 in 3 babies is delivered this way. But for many women, being told they need a C-section is unpleasant news. Duckett says she felt like she missed out on a pivotal moment in her pregnancy.\n\n""It took me a long time even to be able to say that I gave birth to Avery,"" she says. ""I felt like I didn\'t earn the right to say I gave birth to him, like it was taken from me somehow, like I hadn\'t done what I was supposed to do.""\n\nDuckett\'s reaction to her C-section is unfortunately a common one, says Betsey Snow, head of Family and Child Services at Anne Arundel Medical Center, a community hospital in Annapolis, Md.\n\n""I hear a lot of moms say, \'I\'m disappointed I had to have a C-section.\' A lot of women felt like they failed because they couldn\'t do a vaginal delivery,"" says Snow.\n\nNow some hospitals are offering small but significant changes to the procedure to make it seem more like a birth than major surgery.\n\nIn a typical C-section, a closed curtain shields the sterile operating field. Mothers don\'t see the procedure and their babies are immediately whisked away for pediatric care — a separation that can last for close to half an hour. Kristen Caminiti, of Crofton, Md., knows this routine well. Her first two sons were born by traditional cesarean. She was happy with their births because, she says, it was all she knew. Then, just a few weeks into her third pregnancy, Caminiti, who is 33, saw a post on Facebook about family-centered cesarean techniques catching on in England.\n\n""I clicked on the link and thought, \'I want that,\' "" she says.\n\nThe techniques are relatively easy and the main goals simple: Let moms see their babies being born if they want and put newborns immediately on the mother\'s chest for skin-to-skin contact. This helps stimulate bonding and breast feeding. Caminiti asked her obstetrician, Dr. Marcus Penn, if he\'d allow her to have this kind of birth. He said yes.\n\nWhen Caminiti told Penn what she wanted, his first thought was it wouldn\'t be that difficult to do. ""I didn\'t see anything that would be terribly out of the norm,"" he says. ""It would be different from the way we usually do it, but nothing terrible that anyone would say we shouldn\'t try that.""\n\nIt was the most amazing and grace-filled experience to finally have that moment of having my baby be placed on my chest.\n\nFamily-centered cesareans are a relatively new idea in the U.S., and many doctors and hospitals have no experience with them. Penn and the staff at Anne Arundel Medical Center quickly realized the procedure would require some changes, including adding a nurse and bringing the neonatal team into the operating room.\n\nAnd there were a bunch of little adjustments, such as moving the EKG monitors from their usual location on top of the mother\'s chest to her side. This allows the delivery team to place the newborn baby immediately on the mother\'s chest. In addition, Penn says, the mother\'s hands were not strapped down and the intravenous line was put in her nondominant hand so she could hold the baby.\n\nAt the beginning of October, Caminiti underwent her C-section. She was alert, her head was up and the drape lowered so she could watch the delivery of her son, Connor. Caminiti\'s husband, Matt, recorded the event. After Connor was out, with umbilical cord still attached, he was placed right on Caminiti\'s chest.\n\n""It was the most amazing and grace-filled experience to finally have that moment of having my baby be placed on my chest,"" Caminiti says. ""He was screaming and then I remember that when I started to talk to him he stopped. It was awesome.""\n\nAnd the baby stayed with her for the rest of the procedure.\n\nChanges like this can make a big difference, says Dr. William Camann, the director of obstetric anesthesiology at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston and one of the pioneers of the procedure in the U.S. At Brigham and Women\'s, their version of the family-centered cesarean is called the gentle cesarean. Moms who opt for it can view the birth through a clear plastic drape, and immediate skin-to-skin contact follows.\n\nCamann says the gentle C-section is not a replacement for a vaginal birth; it\'s just a way to improve the surgical experience. ""No one is trying to advocate for C-sections. We really don\'t want to increase the cesarean rate, we just want to make it better for those who have to have it,"" he says.\n\nSo why has the procedure been slow to catch on? Hospitals aren\'t charging more for it — so cost doesn\'t seem to be a major factor. What\'s lacking are clinical studies. Without hard scientific data on outcomes and other concerns like infection control, many hospitals may be wary of changing their routines. Betsey Snow of Anne Arundel Medical Center says the family-centered C-section represents a cultural shift, and her hospital is helping break new ground by adopting it.\n\n""It is the first time we have really done anything innovative or creative with changing the C-section procedure in years,"" she says.\n\nKristen Caminiti says her hope is that these innovations become routine. She says she\'d like nothing more than to know that other women having C-sections are able to have the same amazing experience she had.']","The family-centered or “gentle” cesarean is an interesting concept and newsworthy for its innovation. This engaging NPR piece conveys much of what readers would want to know, but leans a bit too heavily on the opinions of advocates for our liking.","This NPR story was a pleasure to listen to, as well as read. It was full of color, anecdotes and scenes, at least in the audio piece. But the two mothers who are proponents of so-called family-centered C-sections ran the whole show, and there were no counter-arguments to put their experiences into perspective. One comes away from this story wondering whether there are any disadvantages at all to family-centered cesareans. For example, is it possible that watching the procedure could be traumatic for some mothers? Seeking out the perspective of an independent expert — perhaps an ob/gyn who who routinely performs standard C-sections — would’ve been a good way to balance the enthusiasm of proponents with a more objective viewpoint.

New technology helps women revitalize sex life after menopause,"['Like many breast cancer survivors, 34-year-old Lisa Elliot was prescribed tamoxifen, a hormone therapy drug used to prevent the disease from returning. But after a year on the anti-estrogen medication, she started experiencing menopause-like side effects.\n\n“One of the symptoms that was the worst for me, that nobody ever mentioned, was the vaginal atrophy part of it,” Elliot told FoxNews.com. “That was really detrimental to my life, way more so than hot flashes were.”\n\nVaginal atrophy often occurs after menopause when a woman\'s estrogen levels decrease, which leads to a thinning of the vaginal wall. Some studies estimate it can affect up to 60 percent of postmenopausal women. Symptoms include vaginal dryness, irritation, itchiness, painful intercourse, and frequent urination.\n\nElliott’s symptoms started to impact her day-to-day life to the point where sitting in a chair felt extremely uncomfortable. Sex with her boyfriend also became terribly painful and even caused disputes in her relationship, she said.\n\n“It was probably one of the reasons why that relationship didn\'t continue. To be in your late twenties, early thirties and say to your partner, ‘I\'m sorry we can\'t ever have sex-- ever again, it’s just too painful,’ there\'s a lot of distrust that develops,"" Elliott said. “It was a question of, ‘Well are you not attracted to me? Is there somebody else?’ And that wasn\'t the case at all.”\n\nDespite the dire conditions, only 20 to 25 percent of postmenopausal women seek treatment. Estrogen replacement therapy is commonly used to cure the condition, but it is not recommended for all patients. Since many breast cancers are fed by estrogen, these drugs are not safe for women like Elliott.\n\nDoctors may also propose vaginal moisturizers and lubricants to help, but when these over-the-counter options were ineffective for Elliott, her doctors suggested the MonaLisa Touch, a laser treatment.\n\n“This is a unique fractional carbon dioxide laser that\'s been utilized for many many years in the face, and in the neck to revitalize that skin,” Dr. Mickey Karram, the director of urogynecology at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati Ohio, told FoxNews.com.\n\nThe therapeutic laser has been available in Italy for several years, but it was only recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n“The skin becomes more lubricated; the actual skin surface thickens, becomes less sensitive, and becomes more pliable. It basically restores everything that you would see in that vaginal canal when the woman had normal circulating estrogen,” Karram, who authored the first U.S. clinical trial on the treatment, said.\n\nDuring the procedure, the laser probe is inserted into the vagina and releases photon energy to the skin to stimulate the production of collagen.\n\n“It initiates a process that starts to produce more cells that are important for that skin to be revitalized. And most of that is around collagen, and a material called glycogen, and these fibroblasts that get circulated,” Karram said. “Once the process gets going, within days usually a woman feels there\'s more lubrication.”\n\nThe laser technology is administered by a trained obstetrician or gynecologist, takes about five minutes, and does not require anesthesia. Women receive three laser sessions spaced six weeks apart and once yearly afterward.\n\nSome experts do warn that further long-term efficacy and safety tests need to be done. To date, there has not been a placebo controlled trial or head-to-head trials with any other treatments, but those studies are in the process of being completed, Karram said.\n\nKarram’s initial U.S. studies have shown some encouraging results with patients showing 85 to 90 percent improvement of all symptoms.\n\n“In my 15 patients, 13 were basically cured and felt that all of their symptoms had resolved. Two of the patients had a few residual symptoms, but had significant improvement,” he said.\n\nAfter a session, women may experience some spotting as a potential side effect and doctors do tell patients to avoid sexual intercourse for at least 24 to 72 hours after. The office-based procedure itself, however, is seemingly painless, Karram said.\n\n“The insertion of the laser does hurt a little bit— it\'s like getting a pap smear,” Elliott said. “But the lasering itself doesn\'t. It feels just fine. And in fact, right afterwards you feel fine too, there\'s no residual pain.”\n\nElliott admitted she was skeptical of how effective the laser treatment would be, but after completing her three sessions she is more than happy she tried it.\n\n“I feel amazing. I feel like I did before the atrophy, before the tamoxifen, before all of the bad stuff,” Elliott said. “Today I have a confidence that I didn\'t have for a very long time because I know that I can be sexually active with somebody that I care about and I don\'t have to worry about being broken.”\n\nThe MonaLisa Touch therapy can cost up to $3,000 and it is not covered by insurance.\n\nFor more information visit SmileMonaLisa.com.']","In national news that felt more like advertising, this story reports on a sample of 13 women “basically cured” of vaginal atrophy symptoms. But we don’t learn anything about those women – except the success story anecdote of one.  This is not a model for how to report on new laser treatments.","The article anecdotally describes the wondrous benefits of a fractional carbon dioxide laser marketed as MonaLisa Touch designed to decrease  vaginal dryness and tissue shrinkage in women given certain drugs for the treatment of breast cancer, and presumably other women who are perimenopausal. For whatever reason, FoxNews chose to profile one MD and his series of 15 patients.   Few details are given about the clinical research upon which the device’s many claims are based. Because the procedure is very new (it was introduced in the United States in December 2014), nothing is known about long-term benefits or harms from the procedure. This is an example of a story that is digestible without being very useful.

Behavior and quality of life also improved.\n\nBut surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\n“What the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,” senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nNot only “does it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,” she said, it demonstrates that surgery “should be done as early as possible” once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.\n\nAbout 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can’t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.\n\n“This is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,” said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.\n\n“The results are impressive,” he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. “The study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It’s documentation that these techniques really work.”\n\nAlthough 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.\n\nWhen all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.\n\nSuccess rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child’s particular brain abnormality.\n\nSurgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn’t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and “that may be too soon to see a noticeable change” in the intelligence quotient.\n\nPost-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.\n\nThe weakness “is significant,” Dr. Tripathi said. “The child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.”\n\nOther side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.\n\nIn contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.\n\nThe surgery “had a transforming effect on how they get along in life,” Dr. Tripathi said. “Many could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.”\n\nBut a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.\n\nRather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.\n\n“Studies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,” he said. “I hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2gVClQv The New England Journal of Medicine, online October 25, 2017.']",The story also discusses the potential hurdles in getting insurance coverage for the procedure.,"This article describes results of a randomized trial of neurosurgical procedures designed to eliminate seizures in children under 18 years of age whose epilepsy is resistant to drug therapy.

The research was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research\'s special conference, Colorectal Cancer: Biology to Therapy.\n\nScreening for Colon Cancer: Back Story \'\'One in every 17 of us will have colon cancer in our lifetime,"" says David Ahlquist, MD, professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who presented his findings on the new colon cancer screening test. Although colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for men and women in the U.S., many adults don\'t undergo the screenings once they reach age 50 (or earlier for those with a family history), Ahlquist told a news conference. Estimates of how many adults undergo screening vary, but Ahlquist says probably only 40% adhere to the screening schedule over time. One screening test, the colonoscopy, in which a flexible, lighted tube with a video camera is inserted to examine the colon, requires dietary restriction and preparation of the colon. Patients must often take time off work and need transportation home from the procedure.']","There were many ways we saw journalists hype this study.  (One journalist wrote to us that the news was “PR-driven hooey” and “frothy.”) Instead of framing this as “A new, consumer-friendly test for colon cancer” that “could persuade more Americans to undergo screening,” this story could have provided more meaningful context.","Framing – and placement of components within a story – can make such a difference.  There was good balance and independent perspective in this story – such as this quote: “The (test’s) performance may decrease considerably when the test is used in a large population of healthy individuals.”  But it came late, long after the story had led with the cheerleading sentence above.

Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.\n\nThe combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available.\n\nAlthough men have sometimes received a bad rap for not being willing to assume responsibility for birth control, Dr. Joseph Alukal, an assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City, thinks this reputation may be somewhat undeserved.\n\n""I think [men] would use it more than is realized,"" said Alukal, who was not involved in the new research. ""Plenty of guys are concerned about unwanted pregnancy, almost as much as women.""\n\nUnfortunately, condoms and vasectomy have remained the only commercially available contraception options for men.\n\nThe results of the study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, were presented at the recent Endocrine Society annual meeting, held in Houston.\n\nAccording to Wang, the gel was applied in two spots -- the testosterone component on the arm and the progestin component on the abdomen. The gels were applied every day for six months.\n\nThe study, conducted in conjunction with the University of Washington, involved 56 men who were assigned to receive one of three types of gels: one gel containing both testosterone plus a gel containing one of two doses of the synthetic progestin; or a gel containing testosterone on its own plus a ""placebo"" gel with no progestin.\n\nUp to 89 percent of the men who received the combination formulas saw their sperm concentrations plunge to less than 1 million sperm per milliliter, versus just 23 percent of those receiving only testosterone.\n\nNormal sperm concentration is more than 15 million sperm per milliliter, according to the Mayo Clinic\'s website.\n\nUp to 78 percent of men receiving the drug combination in the study saw their concentrations drop to no sperm at all, versus only 23 percent of men taking testosterone alone.\n\nThe testosterone/progestin combination works by shutting off the hormones that control production of sperm in the testes, Wang explained.\n\nOne important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be.\n\nThe answer, said Wang, is ""We just don\'t know.""\n\nThat\'s apart from mild-to-moderate acne or an increase in acne, which was seen in about 21 percent of participants.\n\nA new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated.\n\nAnother question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said.\n\nIn addition to planning more studies on this combination protocol, Wang is also in early phases of testing the male hormone dimethandrolone, which is more potent than testosterone.\n\nBecause the new study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThere\'s more on contraception at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.']","This story about a birth control gel for men left some key questions unanswered, giving readers a less-than-complete view of how “promising” this contraceptive really is.","A generally cautious and informative piece, but this story didn’t quite measure up on several key benchmarks, including the explanation of benefits and harms, and the evidence quality evaluation.

But just as rust slowly eats away at a nail, oxygen can age your body. As your cells use this vital element, they produce free radicals — unstable molecules that can damage your tissues and add wear and tear to your entire body, including your skin.\n\nMany anti-aging products promise younger-looking skin through the power of antioxidants, compounds that help neutralize free radicals before they can do any harm. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C and beta carotene show up in a lot of sunscreens and lotions. But if you want your antioxidants to go more than skin deep, you might be interested in oral supplements.\n\nProleva, a supplement from Allmera Nutraceuticals, contains antioxidants from several different sources, including green tea, acai berries, goji berries and resveratrol, a compound found in grape skins. Users are instructed to take two capsules once a day. You can buy a bottle of 60 capsules on the company website for about $60.\n\nVivida, a supplement from Lifes2Good Inc., contains astaxanthin, an antioxidant that’s extracted from algae, along with vitamin C. Other ingredients include silica, from the horsetail plant, and a “marine extract” from cod and other ocean fish. Users are instructed to take one tablet in the morning and one in the evening. A bottle of 60 tablets costs about $50.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims\n\nAccording to the company website, Proleva is a “fountain of youth” that can give users “youthful, glowing skin.” The site adds that “healthy vibrant skin comes not from a cream but from within.” (The site also says that the supplement will improve memory, enhance the immune system and speed healing, but those are claims for another time.)\n\nRon Slavick, the managing director of Allmera Nutraceuticals, says many Proleva customers boast of their softer, younger-looking skin. “You can’t treat skin with lotions and potions,” he says. “Healthy skin is a reflection of the health of the body.” He believes that the natural plant extracts in Proleva work better than the artificially produced antioxidants found in most multivitamins.\n\nThe website for Vivida says that the product “nourishes skin from the inside” to make it “smoother, firmer, and healthier.” Lifes2Good President Mark Holland says that antioxidants help “take impurities away from the skin” while softening fine lines and wrinkles. According to Holland, the antioxidants work together with the marine extract to keep the skin moist and supple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bottom line\n\nOver the years, scientists have largely dashed the hopes that antioxidants could be the secret to good health and longer lives. Studies have failed to show that antioxidant supplements such as vitamin E and beta carotene can prevent heart disease, cancer or other major diseases. There’s still some hope that antioxidants can help the skin, but the results likely aren’t as dramatic as the companies suggest, says Dr. Patricia Farris, a fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology who has a cosmetic dermatology practice in Metarie, La.\n\n“These products are over-hyped,” Farris says. “Only a few studies show that you can improve the appearance of skin with any type of supplement.”\n\nAccording to Farris, some but not all studies suggest that antioxidants can help protect the skin from sun damage, one of the major causes of wrinkles. But she notes that this would only prevent signs of aging, not fix any problems that a person already has. “I tell patients that antioxidants might help protect the skin, but they won’t repair the skin,” she says.\n\nProponents of antioxidants can point to a few studies with encouraging results. For example, a German study of 36 adults published in 2006 in the journal Skin Pharmacology and Physiology found that volunteers taking supplements containing the antioxidants lutein, selenium and lycopene (among other things) had measurably smoother skin after 12 weeks. There were no such benefits for the subjects taking a placebo. The changes were assessed with a scanning device, and it’s unclear if any benefits were visible to the naked eye.\n\nIn an unpublished, company-funded study provided by Holland, 83 women who took Vivida reported generally positive results. After 12 weeks, 74% said that their skin looked smoother and softer. These results weren’t confirmed by a dermatologist or anyone else, and there was no control group for comparison.\n\nPlant-based nutrients deserve more study, but the field is still in its infancy, says Dr. David McDaniel, an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at Eastern Virginia Medical School who runs a cosmetic dermatology clinic in Virginia Beach. Because products vary widely in their ingredients and their doses, he can’t recommend any particular product without evidence to back it up.\n\n“Without well-designed, statistically valid trials, I’m a skeptic,” he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurious about a consumer health product?

Everyone from pro athletes to stroke survivors are benefitting from aquatic exercise that combines walking or running against the natural resistance of the water to help build strength and endurance.\n\nRunning and walking in water is an excellent form of physical therapy for people rehabilitating from hip, knee and back injuries and surgeries. It’s also an easy-on-the joints form of exercise for seniors and others who suffer from arthritis, and a recent study shows it can speed recovery from stroke faster than using a traditional treadmill.\n\nIt’s just an all-around good aerobic conditioner for athletes, too, sports medicine expert Dr. Naresh Rao, told CBS News. Rao is the Olympic Team USA Water Polo Physician for the 2016 Summer Games.\n\n“We’ve been using hydrotherapy to help decrease any sort of gravity that can affect joint function,” said Rao, who is also with the department of family medicine at Plainview Hospital in Plainview, New York. “I personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues.”\n\nHydrotherapy uses a water-friendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool. Another method involves a specially designed treadmill tank.\n\nMatt Johnson, a physical therapist at St. Luke’s Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, told CBS News that the tank is basically a freestanding tub, about six feet long by three feet wide, with a motorized belt. The water height can be adjusted to the patient’s abilities. The buoyancy of the water helps someone who’s been injured to walk and run a little sooner than they’d be able to do on dry ground, he explained.\n\n“In water, we can teach them sooner. They can really work on their gait, walk without pain, do exercises in water that you wouldn’t be able to do on land,” said Johnson.\n\nA physical therapy patient at St. Luke’s in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, participates in water therapy in a Hydro Track system by Conray Incorporated. Physical Therapy at St. Luke's Hospital, Bethlehem, Pa.\n\nHe uses a HydroTrack Underwater Treadmill System – professional sports teams including the New York Yankees and the Miami Dolphins, have used it, too. The nice thing about it, said Johnson, is that people can step right into the tank at ground level and then the water fills up around them. It works like a lock on a canal, he said. So, even older patients with limited mobility and balance don’t have to negotiate getting down into a pool.\n\nJohnson starts off recuperating athletes and patients in water somewhere between waist and chest height. The treadmill speed can be set anywhere from 0.3 to 7.1 miles per hour depending on how much resistance a person can handle.\n\n“At waist height, it’s at about 50 percent of body weight. At chest height, it’s about 30 percent of body weight,” Johnson said, noting, for example, that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waist-high water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee.\n\n“Taking some of that pressure off the knee helps them tolerate that knee injury longer,” said Johnson.\n\nA recent study in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation showed that water workouts might benefit stroke survivors. Researchers asked 21 patients who’d had a stroke within the past two months to undergo two treadmill exercise tests – one submerged in water and one on a regular treadmill. They gradually increased walking speed and slope over time until the patients couldn’t go any further. Walking on the underwater treadmill produced better measures when it came to maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), a reflection of heart and lung function during exercise, and metabolic equivalents, a measure of energy use.\n\n“The study proposes a different, very innovative approach” to rehabilitation after stroke, said Dr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, director of geriatric education at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York.\n\nWolfe-Klein told CBS News she has tried water workouts and said you don’t even feel like you break a sweat even if your heart rate is up. “It’s a very pleasant way of achieving exactly what you’re trying to do – allowing a cardio-respiratory response,” Wolfe-Klein told CBS News.\n\nShe noted that medicine’s veterinary counterparts have been using water therapy for years with injured racehorses.\n\nMichael Phelps, Simone Manuel make history in Rio\n\nBudd Coates, training director at Runner’s World magazine, said runners don’t just plunge into water\u200b therapy when they’re injured; it’s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes, too. Some recreational swimming pools and homeowners with backyard pools have manual treadmills that are water-safe and can be plunked right in the water.\n\nAn alternative to a water treadmill: Some pool companies will install a water flow system you can work out against.\n\n“It creates a water force and helps keep you jogging in place,” said Coates.\n\nFor those without access to a water treadmill, you can purchase a foam vest specifically designed for water jogging or use foam barbells to help keep you afloat. Some pools may loan them out, too.\n\nOr, Coates suggested, just try it freeform with waist- or chest-high water to start. If you have trouble getting in out of a recreational pool, look for one that has a slanting beach-style entry into the water, or one with a robotic chair lift. Ask a pool lifeguard or certified swim instructor to help you.\n\nIf running’s not your thing, but the water looks inviting, Coates said there are also spin bikes that can be used underwater.\n\nCoates said the beauty of water running (or even walking) is that it’s great for any age and any level of ability, from elderly stroke survivors to Olympic athletes.\n\nGalen Rupp, the 2016 Rio Olympics\u200b men’s marathon bronze medalist, relies on it as part of his training.\n\n“He and some of the other guys on the Nike team, it’s well known they take advantage of the anti-gravity treadmill and the aqua track,” Coates said.""]","The story highlights several reasons why water-based therapy may be appealing, but provides no evidence to say that the outcomes mentioned are actually improved.","This story offers a general overview of the potential benefits of running or walking underwater, either using a specially-designed underwater treadmill or in a pool. The story notes that this reduces stress on a patient’s joints, and refers to a relatively recent study showing possible cardiovascular benefits for stroke patients.
The story highlights several reasons why water-based therapy may be appealing (leading to “health experts gushing” over it), but provides no evidence to show that people get better using this therapy, or that it works better than standard physical therapy.  And that’s important to discuss, considering the presumed higher price tag and lack of availability compared to standard PT–though the story doesn’t discuss these points, either.

""And that print can tell us a lot about a person, what they\'ve been exposed to and what disease they have,"" he added.\n\n""That\'s what makes the new field of breath testing so promising, because it is non-intrusive, so there is no risk involved,"" Dweik said. ""And you can do it anywhere, in a clinic, in a hospital, anywhere.""\n\nThe findings were published March 25 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\n\nThe study authors pointed out that the most common reason American patients are admitted to a hospital is when there is a suspicion of heart failure -- a tough-to-treat condition in which the heart\'s pumping action grows gradually weaker over time.\n\nCurrently, a diagnosis of heart failure comes from a variety of factors, according to the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. These include medical history and symptoms, and a physical exam in which a doctor will listen to a patient\'s heart and lung sounds, and check ankles, feet, legs and abdomen for signs of fluid buildup. Blood tests and an electrocardiogram can help confirm that heart failure exists.\n\nIn the new study, to gauge how well the noninvasive breath test could identify heart failure, the team collected exhaled breath samples from 41 patients who had been admitted as in-patients to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nOf those, 25 had been admitted with a primary diagnosis of ""acute decompensated heart failure"" while another 16 patients had shown no signs of heart failure but did have other cardiovascular issues. A single breath sample was obtained from each of the patients within 24 hours of admission, as well as from an additional 36 patients with acute decompensated heart failure as an independent point of comparison.\n\nWithin two hours of collection, all the samples were subject to the breath test analysis, which relied upon ""mass spectrometry"" technology to scan the samples for their molecular and chemical compound content. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure.\n\nThe result: The breath test correctly identified all the patients with heart failure, clearly distinguishing them from those cardiac cases where heart failure was not an issue.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor\'s office or clinic than in the hospital.\n\n""If it is clear that it is highly reliable and specific and sensitive, then yes, it would be a welcome advance,"" he said. ""But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it\'s most challenging to identify heart failure. Today a diagnosis in that environment is based on a patient\'s history and exam, but symptoms for heart failure can easily overlap with a lot of other diagnoses. And the blood work that would be taken in a doctor\'s office might not come back until the next day, delaying identification,"" he noted.\n\n""So a breath test would be most useful in that kind of challenging situation,"" Fonarow said. ""But in an emergency room, while there are challenges as well, bedside blood tests are much more readily drawn and quickly analyzed so you can often get the results in minutes. So there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting.""\n\nStudy author Dweik added that the test is ""theoretically cheap. But of course we\'re still early in the process of exploring its potential. This study is really a proof of concept. There is much more work that needs to be done to get it to the point where it would become widely available.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on heart failure, visit the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.']","News editors should have taken a hint from the editors of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology who gave this research space for only a brief report, not thinking it worthy of a full-length article. The story exaggerates the importance and mischaracterizes the results of the study.","It is interesting that our breath can contain clues to the condition of our hearts. And the idea of a breath test complementing blood and other tests for heart failure is fascinating. But by highlighting “100% accuracy,” this story goes beyond simply describing a tantalizing concept and misleads readers about the status of this line of research. It muddles the real matter, proper diagnosis of patients with suspected heart failure, with the separate question asked in this research: are trace components in the breath of patients with known heart failure distinct from those with other known heart problems? In the end, the story merely reaches an obvious conclusion that better tests would be better… without really assessing whether this sort of breath test might really be better.
This study shares the flaw of many diagnostic accuracy studies – spectrum bias; when you enroll groups of “known to have” and “known not to have” the test performs better.

Unlike some other organs in the body, such as the liver or skin, the brain does not regenerate new connections, blood vessels or new tissue structures. Tissue that dies in the brain from stroke is absorbed, leaving a cavity, devoid of blood vessels, neurons or axons, the thin nerve fibers that project from neurons.\n\nTo see if healthy tissue surrounding the cavity could be coaxed into healing the stroke injury, Segura engineered a gel to inject into the stroke cavity that thickens to mimic the properties of brain tissue, creating a scaffolding for new growth.\n\nThe gel is infused with molecules that stimulate blood vessel growth and suppress inflammation, since inflammation results in scars and impedes regrowth of functional tissue.\n\nAfter 16 weeks, stroke cavities in mice contained regenerated brain tissue, including new neural networks - a result that had not been seen before. The mice with new neurons showed improved motor behavior, though the exact mechanism wasn\'t clear.\n\n""The new axons could actually be working,"" said Segura. ""Or the new tissue could be improving the performance of the surrounding, unharmed brain tissue.""\n\nThe gel was eventually absorbed by the body, leaving behind only new tissue.\n\nThis research was designed to explore recovery in acute stroke, or the period immediately following stroke - in mice, that is five days; in humans, that is two months. Next, Carmichael and Segura are determining if brain tissue can be regenerated in mice long after the stroke injury. More than 6 million Americans are living with the long-term outcomes of stroke, known as chronic stroke.\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Carmichael and Segura, other authors of the paper are Lina Nih and Shiva Gojgini, both of UCLA.\n\nThe study was supported by funds from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nLeigh Hopper, Senior Public Information Officer\n\nlhopper@mednet.ucla.edu\n\n310-308-0405']","Compared to many news releases we review that have to do with rodent research, this one was more cautious with its language than most.","The news release summarizes a study on whether a gel — introduced into stroke-damaged areas of mouse brains — can stimulate the regrowth of neurons and blood vessels.
The findings suggest that it can. But that’s a far cry from proving that this regrowth can function as normal brain tissue and, therefore, be “stroke-healing” in humans. Still, the news release is one of the better releases we’ve seen in terms of  making it clear that the study was in mice. Mice is referenced in the headline and throughout.
Compared to many news releases we review that have to do with rodent research, this one was also more cautious with its language than most. A more substantial discussion of the harms and benefits of this experimental treatment would have made the release even stronger.

Aside from helping to prevent the metabolic syndrome– a cluster of risk factors for heart disease and diabetes- a new study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology says, the diet can have positive global effects on the individual risk factors: low HDL (""good"") cholesterol, high triglycerides, high blood pressure and a high blood sugar rate, as seen by your doctor through a blood test. In addition, waist size is a risk factor- a waist more than 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men is of concern.\n\nThe syndrome is present when someone has three of those five risk factors.\n\n""[The study is] one of the first studies that evaluated the role of Mediterranean diet on metabolic syndrome, and revealed a beneficial association- quite a big influence, taking into account that the Mediterranean diet is a non-pharmacological mean,"" said study author Demosthenes Panagiotakos, from the Department of Science of Dietetics-Nutrition at Harokopio University of Athens in Greece.\n\nTake this test to see how well you\'re managing your diabetes\n\nThe researchers looked at over half a million people from 50 previous studies on the Mediterranean diet, which included people in Spain, Greece, the U.S., France, Sweden, Italy and Australia, among other countries.\n\nThey found the beneficial effects from diets rich in fruits and vegetables, olives and olive oil, low-fat dairy products and whole grain cereals. Other components included: a moderate daily intake of alcohol with meals- mostly from red wine; eating fish, poultry or tree nuts (like walnuts or cashews) weekly; and limiting eating red meat to about twice a month. The researchers say what\'s responsible are the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nPanagiotakos added that the diet includes all main food groups, but in a balanced way. The study notes physical activity is also an important part in preventing the risk factors for the metabolic syndrome.\n\nTips for managing your diabetes\n\nThe Mediterranean diet isn\'t just a little extra olive oil, noted Dr. Robert Eckel, an endocrinologist and past president of the American Heart Association.\n\n""It\'s all these other components,"" Eckel said.\n\n""I think the health professional needs to recognize that people that meet the criteria for the metabolic syndrome are at higher risk [for heart disease and diabetes] and we strongly recommend that lifestyle intervention is used to prevent the syndrome and also to modify its prevalence,"" he said.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, data from 2003-2006 shows a third of adults age 20 and older met that criteria. And just a few years earlier, over 9 percent of adolescents ages 12-19 were classified as having the syndrome. That translates into 2.9 million young people.\n\nBut it\'s not only in the U.S.\n\n""This is a global epidemic,"" Eckel emphasized. ""This is not simply America. It\'s occurring throughout Mexico, Central and South America, Southeast Asia, Australia and around the world.""\n\nEckel said obesity is by far the largest issue responsible for the metabolic syndrome. According to the World Health Organization\'s 2008 figures, at least one in three of the world\'s adult population is overweight, and almost one in 10 people is obese. For children, the numbers are also sobering: 20 million kids under age 5 are overweight.\n\nPanagiotakos concludes that this pattern of eating can be easily adopted by people of various cultures and populations.\n\n""The macro-environment we are living promotes obesity in all age groups of people... the choice of a healthy diet, like the Mediterranean diet, is on our hands. Better eating (from childhood to older life) contributes to better quality of life,"" he said.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Slightly inferior to <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3701"" target=""_blank"">Wall Street Journal story</a> on same study.

And this strategy … could potentially be used,” said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMolina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.\n\n“I don’t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,” Molina said. “But if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.”\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine.

Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nRates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 — 8.7 cases per 100,000 people — was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.\n\nMolina’s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics — the drug doxycycline — to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.\n\nThe men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn’t cure gonorrhea.\n\nThere was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can’t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.\n\nThe results can’t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nSpellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts — their own gut flora — to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.\n\n“You’re causing friendly fire injury,” he said.\n\nThe full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.\n\nMolina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.\n\nA commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.\n\nAuthors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia’s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.\n\nLaxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. “I certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,” he said.\n\nBut he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.""]","On the plus side, readers who stick with the story to the end are given many warnings from the researchers and independent sources.","Getty Images
This is a story about a test of using antibiotics right after sex to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men and use no condoms.
On the plus side, readers who stick with the story to the end are given many warnings from the researchers and independent sources about the risks of deploying such a strategy. In that respect this is a very thoroughly reported story.
However, the story implies the results may be relevant to the general population even though the people included in the study have a risk of syphilis, for example, that is more then 1,000 times higher than the general population. All men in the study were also taking antiviral prophylaxis against HIV infection.
Much of our concern about the story stems from the overly broad headline, and we’re the first to acknowledge that reporters often have little control over that key aspect of their work. Nevertheless, we think it’s something that needs to be addressed if readers are to receive an accurate picture of the research and its relevance.

Cleared by the FDA, CoolSculpting works by gently cooling targeted fat cells in the body to induce a natural, controlled elimination of fat cells without affecting surrounding tissue, and the treated fat cells are gone for good. Millions of CoolSculpting treatments have been performed in more than 80 countries. CoolSculpting is available through a network of CoolSculpting Centers worldwide. Dermatologists, plastic surgeons and aesthetic specialists that offer CoolSculpting can be found at www.coolsculpting.com.\n\nIn the U.S., the CoolSculpting procedure is FDA-cleared for the treatment of visible fat bulges in the submental area, thigh, abdomen and flank, along with bra fat, back fat, underneath the buttocks (also known as banana roll), and upper arm. It is also FDA-cleared to affect the appearance of lax tissue with submental area treatments.\n\nDuring the procedure you may experience sensations of pulling, tugging, mild pinching, intense cold, tingling, stinging, aching, and cramping at the treatment site. These sensations subside as the area becomes numb. Following the procedure, typical side effects include temporary redness, swelling, blanching, bruising, firmness, tingling, stinging, tenderness, cramping, aching, itching, or skin sensitivity, and sensation of fullness in the back of the throat after submental area treatment. Rare side effects may also occur. The CoolSculpting procedure is not for everyone. You should not have the CoolSculpting procedure if you suffer from cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria.

Please stop.,"This news release by the Irish pharmaceutical company Allergan covers a recently FDA-cleared fat reduction technology to treat double chins. CoolSculpting is claimed to be the first of its kind to be cleared by the US regulatory agency.
However, we found that not to be entirely true, since other non-surgical, FDA-approved fat reduction technologies like injectable Kybella already exist on the market. Kybella is also made by Allergen. Whereas Kybella uses acid to induce cell breakdown, CoolSculpting crystallizes the cells. While Kybella and other technologies reduce double chin, they do not deal with lax skin in the area. Only the Cool-Sculpting technique claims to treat lax skin.
It needs to be highlighted that when a product is “cleared” by the FDA (as this one was) it is not the same as an “approval” which is what Allergan received for Kybella. As outlined in our toolkit primer, a device that is cleared may not go through the same testing nor be required to show the same level of evidence that an earlier product may have.
The news release also doesn’t disclose many details regarding the procedure, costs and corresponding clinical trials leading to FDA approval. Benefits data are given in relative terms, and study design and limitations are not really discussed. The release cites results from a survey that found 73% of patients are bothered by chin fat. The suggestion here is that all of these people are candidates for chin fat reduction — something we equate with disease-mongering.
On the plus side, readers do get a good sense of how available the treatment is and where to find CoolSculpting centers from this news release.

Additionally, they demonstrated that the DNA for all three human genes and one viral gene could be successfully extracted from urine, and they could identify such lesions with 75 percent sensitivity.\n\nTwo commercial tests based on markers of DNA chemical changes called methylation, released in Europe last summer, require Pap smears or swabs of cervical tissue, and show 64 percent sensitivity in identifying similar lesions, according to senior investigator Rafael Guerrero-Preston, Dr.P.H., M.P.H., assistant professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and member of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\n""If further studies confirm these findings, we see a significant use of urine screening as a way to quickly and inexpensively determine if a biopsy is warranted, or if physicians can use a \'watch and wait\' approach before intervening,"" says Guerrero-Preston. Typically, he says, a woman who tests positive for HPV and has an abnormal Pap smear undergoes a biopsy to rule out cervical cancer using cells taken directly from cervical tissue. But previous studies suggest more than 50 percent of these biopsies are unnecessary and can result in pain, worry, infertility and higher health care costs.\n\n""Our urine test would serve as a molecular triage,"" he says, ""at times supplementing Pap test information. In developing countries that don\'t have the money, medical infrastructure or cultural approval for Pap test, our test could be used instead.""\n\nThe new study builds on the Johns Hopkins team\'s previously published work, in which investigators identified three genes associated with cervical cancer or abnormal-looking cells known to become cancerous: FKBP6, INTS1 and ZNF516. As abnormalities progress, these genes were more likely to have a chemical methyl group attached to their DNA in certain spots.\n\nThe researchers tested the value of these genes as markers using 214 cervical cell samples collected from women undergoing Pap smears at Hospital Dr. Hernan Henriquez Aravena in Chile. The women ranged in age from 18 to 86. Among the test samples, 34 showed no abnormalities in their cervix; 87 showed one of three types of precancerous, abnormal tissue; and 90 showed clear evidence of cervical cancer.\n\nNext, Guerrero-Preston\'s team isolated DNA from each cervical tissue sample and used advanced genetic sequencing methods to spell out the DNA makeup of cells in the cervical tissue samples. The researchers then compared the number of methyl groups attached to each gene in samples from the 34 healthy women to 53 samples with a specific subset of precancerous markers.\n\nUsing methylation as a value to diagnose malignancy, the three genes together showed a 90 percent sensitivity, meaning that their presence was able to predict a true positive cancer sample this percentage of the time. The test had an 88.9 percent specificity, meaning the percent of time the test correctly identified someone without the disease.\n\nTo further improve the accuracy of the test, the investigators added a new gene marker to the test. This time, rather than using a human gene, they used one from the virus, HPV16-L1, which also becomes methylated in human cells as cancer develops. They did the test again with the four-gene combination on a new population of women from the University of Puerto Rico. The 115 women ranged in age from 21 to 49; 41 participants had healthy cervical tissue, and 74 had one of three types of precancerous cells. Using all four genes, the test now had a sensitivity of 90.9 percent and a specificity of 60.9 percent.\n\n""When developing a new cancer screening test, we want something in the range of 90 to 95 percent sensitivity, which is competitive with the effectiveness of tests developed and now marketed in Europe,"" says Guerrero-Preston.\n\nThe next step, the researchers report, was to verify that the four-gene test worked using freely circulating DNA from blood and urine, rather than DNA taken directly from cervical tissue.\n\nFor this experiment, they tested 40 samples of paired cervical tissue, blood and urine from a subset of the patients from Puerto Rico. Using the DNA from blood, they found the test had an 85.7 percent sensitivity and a 60.9 percent specificity. Using urine, they found a 75 percent sensitivity and an 83.3 percent specificity.\n\nDuring the course of the study, the time to process cervical samples, blood or urine and get a test result took four days. They plan to continue modifying the test to improve the urine sensitivity to that of the cervical tissue samples.\n\nAccording to World Cancer Research Fund International, 84 percent of cervical cancers occur in less developed countries, with the highest rates in Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean. In the United States, cervical cancer used to be the highest cause of cancer deaths among women, but that soon changed when the yearly Pap smear was introduced over 40 years ago. Countries without the infrastructure or cultural acceptance for regular Pap tests have not seen declining cancer rates.\n\nGuerrero-Preston and his colleagues have a research agreement with Cepheid to develop a way to reduce the waiting time for a test result from a maximum of four days in the lab to under three hours in a Cepheid instrument using sealed cartridges to minimize sample handling and contamination.\n\nAdditional authors on the study include Blanca Valle, Anne Jedlicka, Nitesh Turaga, Oluwasina Folawiyo, Francesca Pirini, Fahcina Lawson, Angelo Vergura, Maartje Noorhuis, Amanda Dziedzic, Gabriela Perez, Marisa Renehan, Carolina Guerrero-Diaz, Bruce Trock Liliana Florea and David Sidransky of The Johns Hopkins University; Edgar De Jesus Rodriguez, Jose Rodriguez Orengo, Keimari Mendez and Josefina Romaguera of the University of Puerto Rico; and Teresa Diaz-Montes of the Institute for Cancer Care at Mercy.\n\nThe research was funded by National Cancer Institute grants (U01 CA084986, K01 CA164092 and U01 CA084986).']","Under the best of scenarios, the new test gets it wrong 10 in 100 times. That’s a potential harm that the release didn’t call out.","In an effort to increase the accuracy of cervical cancer diagnoses, a team of researchers is developing a urine test that looks for methylation (a mechanism used by cells to control gene expression) in four genes and, at this early stage, shows evidence of both dramatically improving detection of cancer and enhancing physicians’ ability to determine that a woman does not have cancer.

The release doesn’t give enough attention to the potential downside of the test — a real risk of under-diagnosis — and fails to clearly signal that this diagnostic effort is still at an early stage, making the validity and eventual availability of the test uncertain.

Standard removal procedures for such clots, which involves injecting blood thinning medication throughout a patient’s body, have proved risky and ineffective in the past. But Trellis’ method makes it safer and quicker.\n\n“For years, that condition has not hit a technology that could resolve the problem. I am a physician, so I see what needs to be addressed,” said Dr. Thomas Fogarty, who invented the Trellis device, which the FDA approved in 2005. “I develop things based on what is needed in the field of surgery.”\n\nSunnyvale resident Rose Kirby underwent the Trellis procedure in January after a 10-inch clot formed from the base of her upper arm to her chest. Believing she was having a reaction to a bug bite or a spontaneous allergic reaction, Kirby saw her arm swell to twice its original size.\n\n“I was vacuuming my car, and I was like, ‘This is sort of uncomfortable.’ Within a course of an hour, my arm went from totally normal to a pink balloon,” said Kirby, 22. “I was really lucky that my parents made me go in to the doctor that day.”\n\nLarge clots that form in the veins of arms or legs often cause a condition known as deep venous thrombosis. If left untreated, such a clot could break off and travel to the lungs, which can lead to death. The standard and still preferred treatment of coursing blood thinner throughout the body does not ensure removal of the clot and could lead to internal bleeding.\n\nDeep venous thrombosis causes about 300,000 deaths annually in the United States — more than AIDS and breast cancer combined, according to the Coalition to Prevent Deep-Vein Thrombosis.\n\nEach month, Dr. Tej M. Singh of El Camino Hospital in Mountain View sees about 10 cases of the condition, which can develops during long international flights. People who are older than 60 and are prone to sedentary behavior or women who take birth control pills are especially vulnerable.\n\n“Before, in most hospitals in America, you just were put on a blood thinner, and they said wait it out. So this is the next level of aggressive care,” for the condition, said Singh, the chief of vascular surgery at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. “Hospitals that are trained to do this have an advantage of helping our patients the best.”\n\nWith the Trellis device, doctors navigate a catheter through the vein and into the clot and inflate a balloon on either side of it. In between the balloons, the wire spins, simultaneously releasing the clot-dissolving drug and breaking up the clot, usually within an hour. The patient usually leaves the hospital within a day with a scar as small as a centimeter.\n\nKirby’s clot resulted from the side effects of her birth control pills and was made worse by a rib that was crushing a vein in her arm every time she moved it. A few months after her clot was removed, the recent graduate of the University of Southern California, who majored in cyber warfare, had surgery to remove a portion of her rib.\n\n“The rib removal was much scarier. You undergo full anesthesia, and you wake up with pain,” Kirby said. “My Trellis scar is one dot, and my rib removal scar is seven centimeters.”\n\nThe Trellis is being used at more than 600 hospitals nationwide as physicians, including some at Stanford Medical Center, have started to move away from treating such clots with full-body blood thinners.\n\nSingh said he has used the device eight times.\n\nBecause of the relative newness of the Trellis, Kirby’s mother was concerned about the risks. But with her daughter’s positive outcome, she has become a proponent of the procedure.\n\n“Rose was somewhat of a rare case. I was relieved that we caught it quickly,” said Mary Usher, Kirby’s mother. “The Trellis worked for us. For that, we are happy.”\n\nContact Julie Chang at 408-920-5064.']","Two journalist-reviewers and one physician-reviewer looked at this story for a long time.  The harder they looked, the less they liked it.  Read why.

This story baldly misstates the evidence (or lack thereof) supporting the effectiveness of a device used to dissolve certain blood clots. Indeed, a careful reader would not even have to delve into the medical evidence to realize something is amiss. The story calls the Trellis Peripheral Infusion Device “life-saving,” effective, and safer and quicker than alternative therapies. However, it notes that only a handful of doctors across the country use the device (even though it has been on the market since 2005) and the clinician quoted in the story says he has used it on only eight patients, even though he sees more than 100 similar patients every year. A reader might well wonder, “If this device is so great, why do so few doctors use it and why do even those who do use it prefer to use different treatments for the overwhelming majority of their patients?” The story ignores that glaring inconsistency. 
This story is also an extreme example of disease-mongering. It portrays deep vein thrombosis as a leading killer. However, not only is the death toll figure it uses taken from a misleading statement on a web site sponsored by a pharmaceutical company that sells drugs to treat the condition, the quoted number of deaths is 30 times the estimated toll listed in a recent report from the U.S. Surgeon General.

Michael Brunt, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. ""One repair isn\'t appropriate for all circumstances.""\n\nHernias occur when part of an internal organ, such as the intestines, bulges out through muscle. At issue are the surgical approaches that physicians use when a patient suffers from a hernia in the groin.\n\nThe procedures are designed to reduce the bulge of the hernia and make a patch so it doesn\'t protrude again. ""It\'s as if you had a leak in a tire that\'s ballooned out,"" Brunt said. ""You\'ll patch it to prevent it from continuing to protrude.""\n\nThe study, led by researchers at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, examined two procedures.\n\nOne procedure, known as total extraperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty, is performed under a general anesthetic and uses a laparoscopic approach through a small opening. It was developed in the 1990s, Brunt said.\n\nThe other approach is older and is performed through a 2- to 2.5-inch incision in the groin, Brunt said. It can be done under local anesthesia. The study authors didn\'t examine a third approach, known as ""patch and plug,"" he said.\n\nIn the study, researchers randomly assigned 660 hernia patients to one of the two surgical procedures. Almost all the patients were men, and their average age was around 55.\n\nThe researchers followed up with 75 percent of the patients after an average period of five years.\n\nHernias recurred in 5 percent of laparoscopic and 8 percent of the traditional-procedure patients. Recurrences decreased to 0.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, if the procedures were performed by experienced surgeons.\n\nAfter five years, 28 percent of those who had the traditional procedure reported chronic pain, compared to 15 percent of the laparoscopic group.\n\nThe study ""confirms what a lot of surgeons who do both procedures know already,"" Brunt said. ""There\'s less pain and a bit of a faster recovery from the laparoscopic procedure.""\n\nStill, ""the vast majority of patients do well, regardless of the approach,"" he said.\n\nWhy use the traditional approach if the laparoscopic technique is better in some ways? The traditional approach may be appropriate when it\'s too risky to place patients under general anesthesia, Brunt said, such as in elderly patients and those with multiple health problems.\n\nBrunt said the costs of the two procedures are comparable, although the laparoscopic procedure may cost more.\n\nThe findings appear in the March issue of the Archives of Surgery.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about hernias, try the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']",Overall this story did enough to meet our expectations for quality health journalism. But we couldn’t help wishing for a few more salient details on key questions.,"This study could have easily been reported as a clear case of new technology besting the old way of doing things. Thankfully, this story avoided that simplistic narrative by reaching out to an independent expert, who explained that the traditional approach is still the preferred option for certain patient groups who aren’t good candidates for general anesthesia. We thought the story could have delved deeper into certain issues that are relevant to patients — like how quickly people were able to return to work after undergoing each procedure, and whether everyone with this type of hernia even needs surgery.The story also would have done well to examine some other studies that don’t support the conclusions reached by these researchers.

There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called “dry” macular degeneration that has no treatment. First patients may notice blurriness when they look straight ahead. Eventually many develop blank spots, becoming legally blind.\n\n“These are seniors who are entering their golden years and now they’ve lost the ability to read, watch television, see their loved ones,” said Dr. Rahul Khurana, a retina specialist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\nThe experimental drug, lampalizumab, aims to slow the destruction of light-sensing cells in the retina, creeping lesions that characterize the stage of dry AMD called “geographic atrophy.” When those cells die, they can’t grow back — the vision loss is irreversible.\n\nWhat the research found\n\nIn an 18-month study of 129 patients, monthly eye injections of the drug modestly slowed worsening of the disease when compared with patients given dummy shots. What’s exciting for scientists came next, when researchers from drugmaker Genentech Inc. took a closer look at exactly who was being helped.\n\nIt turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study’s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry — a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place.\n\nThose are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 per cent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that’s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nWhy would an immune-related gene affect aging eyes?\n\nOne arm of the immune system, the complement pathway, helps fight infections by attracting immune cells to attack bacteria.\n\nNormally, there’s a barrier that keeps such cells away from the retina. But that barrier can break down with age, opening sensitive eye cells to harm from the spillover, explained Genentech immunologist Menno van Lookeren Campagne.\n\nNow for the gene connection: Previous studies have linked macular degeneration to gene variations that remove some of that pathway’s natural brakes, so it can become too active.\n\nThe hypothesis: Genentech’s drug, lampalizumab, essentially offers a backup method for tamping down the immune reaction. An antibody, it works by inhibiting a particular enzyme named factor D that helps power the immune pathway.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\n“We try to reinsert the braking ability,” said study lead author Brian Yaspan, a Genentech senior scientist.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWednesday’s study detected no safety concerns, clearing the way for Genentech and its parent company Roche to open two large-scale studies that aim to prove if the drug works. Results are expected later this year.\n\nThe current research sheds light on how that long-suspected immune culprit might be working, and is “the first suggestion that there may be a treatment for geographic atrophy coming up in the future,” said National Eye Institute retina specialist Dr. Wai Wong, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\n“It’s a very, very exciting study,” said Khurana, the ophthalmologist association’s spokesman, who also wasn’t part of the research. “From the basic science perspective, it makes a lot of sense.”\n\nHealth advice for now\n\nGet more of the Star in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Star.

According to the National Eye Institute, it’s less common in people who exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish.\n\nSymptoms often aren’t noticeable early on. But several eye tests can detect signs of macular degeneration, including a dilated eye exam and a tool called an Amsler grid with straight lines that may look wavy if the macula, the centre of the retina, is harmed.\n\nMacular degeneration patients often are advised to take certain vitamin combinations that may help stave off advanced disease. And it’s important for patients to know what type they have. While there’s no treatment for the advanced dry form, the “wet” form occurs when leaky blood vessels grow under the retina — and there are several therapies that can help those patients preserve vision.""]",The article also falls short when describing the method and findings of the study.,"Credit: National Eye Institute
This story discusses research findings about a drug that may slow the progression of geographic atrophy, a type of macular degeneration that leads to vision loss.
The story provides a careful, reader-friendly explanation of the mechanism by which lampalizumab is likely to work, and a concluding section with clear information about what can currently be done for geographic atrophy.

Users are asked to send a saliva sample -- which carries your D.N.A. -- to their lab, where it is analyzed. Results are then sent back to the user online in three to four weeks.\n\nDr. Valerie Montgomery Rice, a women\'s health researcher at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, told ABC News that ""one in eight [women] will get breast cancer in their lifetime.""\n\n""So it\'s very important the women who are high-risk, we want them to have access to the test, and many of us believe [the price] makes it more affordable,"" Montgomery Rice said.\n\nDevon Gant told ABC News that she used the Color test to find out that she tested positive for the BRCA 2 gene mutation.\n\nABC News\n\n""It\'s kind of a black cloud,"" Gant said. ""It\'s this thing that\'s kind of looming in the future.""\n\nGant said that although there were times when she struggled with the test results, ""it\'s not a death sentence.""\n\nWhen her aunt, Lauren Rossi, took a Color test and also got a positive result for a BRCA mutation, doctors sent Rossi for an MRI, she said.\n\nABC News\n\n""That\'s when they found a couple of spots, said they didn\'t really think it was anything,"" Rossi told ABC News. ""And it came back that it was cancer.""\n\nRossi said that when she received the phone call she ""couldn\'t believe it.""\n\nIn part due to the genetic test, and the early detection, Rossi says she is now cancer-free.\n\n""Thank God,"" she told ABC News. ""It would\'ve been a totally different outcome, probably next February, when I went for, you know, for my mammography.""\n\nShe said that she is grateful that both she and Gant were tested for the BRCA gene mutation because it helped doctors detect cancer in her, and it empowers her niece with knowledge about her health.\n\n""Now she knows,"" Rossi said of her niece.

Saxon, chief of the division of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Southern California\'s Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles, said in a news release from the American Heart Association.\n\n""There\'s a lot of good news here,"" she added.\n\nSaxon and her team reported their observations in the Nov. 22 online edition of Circulation.\n\nCrunching the numbers, the authors determined that 92 percent of ICD patients survive one year out from device implantation. The same is true for 88 percent of CRT-D patients, they noted.\n\nFive years out, those figures dipped to 68 percent for ICD patients and 54 percent for CRT-D patients.\n\nAmong those outfitted with CRT devices alone, one-year survival was pegged at 82 percent, while five-year survival came in at 48 percent, the investigators found.\n\nThe poorer prognosis for CRT-only patients was attributed to their older average age (76 years), and the fact that they may be relatively sicker overall. Patients today tend to receive CRT devices with defibrillators.\n\nThe study team also found that patients whose implants were monitored remotely, on a continual basis, by a health facility network were about half as likely to die as patients who only had intermittent in-person assessments.\n\nRemote monitoring via telephone lines and online physician access is available for all ICD and CRT-D devices, the authors noted, and enrollment in such programs is typically free with a cardiologist\'s recommendation.\n\n""It\'s highly likely the reason these patients did better is that they were receiving earlier diagnoses, and they were also empowered to take charge of their own health care more,"" Saxon said. ""I don\'t think there\'s any reason not to put a patient on it.""\n\nDr. Eric N.

But at our facility we think it makes caring for a patient much easier. Physicians knowing things sooner will theoretically give a patient a better chance for quicker access to appropriate care.

They found that AIM2 deficiency causes uncontrolled proliferation of intestinal cells. Surprisingly, they also discovered that AIM2 influences the microbiota -- the population of gut bacteria -- apparently fostering the proliferation of 'good' bacteria that can protect against colon cancer.\n\nThe team, led by Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology, published their findings in a recent issue of the journal Cell. She said that the findings could have important applications for prevention, prognosis and treatment.\n\n'Since reduced AIM2 activity in colorectal cancer patients is associated with poor survival, it might be useful to detect the level of AIM2 expression in polyps taken from colonoscopy and use this as one of the biomarkers for prognosis,' Kanneganti said.\n\nKanneganti and her team believe that it might be possible to prevent the disease or reduce its risk by treating susceptible people to increase AIM2 activity and give them healthy donor bacteria. 'In people who already have colorectal cancer, therapies that boost the expression of AIM2, such as interferons, might reduce tumor progression. Also, transferring healthy microbiota or a group of 'good' bacteria to patients with colorectal cancer at the early stage of disease may prolong survival,' Kanneganti said.\n\nCancer researchers had known that mutations in AIM2 were frequently found in patients with colorectal cancers. And a study by other researchers had found that more than half of small bowel tumors had AIM2 mutations.\n\nHowever, AIM2's established function in the cell was not in the machinery of cancer, said one of the paper's first authors Si Ming Man, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Kanneganti's laboratory. Rather, he said, AIM2 was known to work in the immune system to detect invading bacteria and viruses and help 'alert' the immune system to battle them.\n\n'When we found that the intestine expressed high levels of AIM2, we hypothesized that this gene may also play a role in regulating gut health,' Man said. 'This was how we became interested in AIM2 and colorectal cancer.'\n\nIn their experiments with mice, the scientists used chemicals to trigger the process mimicking the development of colorectal cancer. They found that the mice showed drastically reduced AIM2 function, confirming the finding in humans with the cancer. They also found that mice genetically altered to have reduced AIM2 function, when treated with the chemicals, showed significantly more tumors than normal mice.\n\nThe scientists' studies also showed that AIM2 played a role independent of its immune role, in suppressing abnormal expansion of intestinal stem cell populations. Conversely, malfunction of AIM2 unleashes abnormal stem cell proliferation. Stem cells are immature cells that differentiate into adult cells such as intestinal cells. These cells continuously proliferate to replace old and dying cells in the intestine.\n\n'Many previous studies have indicated that AIM2 contributes to the immune system by acting as a pathogen sensor,' Man said. 'However, our work is the first to identify AIM2's role in controlling proliferation of intestinal stem cells. This work is truly exciting to us because we have found a new role for AIM2 in regulating colorectal cancer, and it does so by inhibiting excessive proliferation of stem cells in the large intestine.' The researchers also pinpointed the specific cellular machinery regulated by AIM2.\n\nThey decided to explore whether AIM2's protective role might involve gut bacteria, based on studies from Kanneganti's lab and others indicating that microbial sensors similar to AIM2 contributed to healthy gut microbiota. Indeed, the comparison of gut bacteria in normal and AIM2-deficient mice showed a different 'microbial landscape' in the two types of mice.\n\nTo test whether gut bacteria might influence the progression of colon cancer, the researchers housed normal and AIM2-deficient mice together, to enable the exchange of gut bacteria. The scientists found a striking reduction in colon tumors in the AIM2-deficient mice and an increase in tumors in the normal mice.\n\n'What this might suggest is that transfer of some of the 'good' microbiota from wild-type mice to replace the 'bad' microbiota from mice lacking AIM2 offers increased protection against colorectal cancer,' Man said. 'We believe that this finding has important clinical relevance because we can potentially prevent or decelerate the progression of colorectal cancer in humans, especially in those who have mutations in the AIM2 gene, by simply giving them 'good' microbiota.'\n\n'We have only scratched the surface of the role of AIM2 in controlling stem cell proliferation and the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota,' Kanneganti said. 'How exactly AIM2 does both of these functions is an exciting research area to pursue.'\n\n###\n\nThe paper's other authors are Qifan Zhu, Liqin Zhu, Zhiping Liu, Rajendra Karki, Ankit Malik, Deepika Sharma, Liyuan Li, R.K.

Patel, a neurosurgeon at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, England, said in a journal news release.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, high blood pressure affects 30 percent of American adults. The condition raises the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\n""It\'s a really interesting paper,"" said Dr. Nicholas D. Schiff, director of the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuromodulation at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. ""I thought it was compelling, though single cases are always questionable"" to generalize.\n\nIn the case study, a 55-year-old man was implanted with a deep brain stimulator to treat severe pain stemming from a stroke. Although the patient was taking four drugs to control his high blood pressure, which was diagnosed at the time of his stroke, his blood pressure had remained high.\n\nThe man\'s blood pressure gradually decreased enough for him to stop taking all blood pressure medications, though the deep brain stimulation failed to control his pain long-term. When researchers tested turning off the stimulator after two years, the patient\'s blood pressure rose significantly.\n\nThe study adds to other recent research focused on neuromodulation, which harnesses the power of electrical impulses in the body for therapeutic benefit. Tactics being tested include renal nerve ablation, a procedure that emits low-power radiofrequency along the nerves next to the kidneys, interrupting signals that trigger high blood pressure.\n\n""In the general sense, neuromodulation for blood pressure is really going to be a revolutionary treatment for chronic [high] blood pressure,"" said cardiologist Dr. Marc Penn, director of the Cleveland Clinic\'s Bakken Heart-Brain Center.\n\n""I think it\'s really interesting physiology,"" added Penn, noting that the results would need to be repeated multiple times before a therapy based on it could be developed.\n\nSchiff, however, was hesitant to predict that deep brain stimulation might become a common treatment for hard-to-control high blood pressure.\n\n""This is a case report, and not a treatment for anything,"" he said, adding, ""There are risks to this procedure and one has to really look at the tradeoffs.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information about deep brain stimulation, visit the American Association of Neurological Surgeons']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">The fact that this story is based almost entirely on a single case is a major flaw that deserves to be flagged.

To its credit, this story did spend some time drawing attention the limitations of this evidence. However, the story failed to provide information on costs and harms that would have provided a counterweight to enthusiastic talk of benefits. The story also didn’t identify financial relationships between the case report authors and manufacturers of DBS devices–information that readers deserve to have as they ponder the merits of these very preliminary findings.

The test had particularly good results for ovarian and pancreatic cancers, though the number of cancers detected was small.\n\nResearchers hope the test will become part of a “universal screening” tool that doctors can use to detect cancer in patients.\n\n“This is potentially the holy grail of cancer research, to find cancers that are currently hard to cure at an earlier stage when they are easier to cure,” said Dr Eric Klein, lead author of the research from Cleveland Clinic’s Taussig Cancer Institute. “We hope this test could save many lives.”\n\nThe study, by a research team that also included scientists from Stanford University, was presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncologists in Chicago.\n\nSimon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said “new techniques” such as cancer blood tests could “unlock enormous survival gains, as well as dramatic productivity benefits in the practice of medicine”.\n\n“Now, as the NHS marks its 70th anniversary, we stand on the cusp of a new era of personalised medicine that will dramatically transform care for cancer and for inherited and rare diseases,” said Stevens.\n\nThe research scrutinised the cases of more than 1,600 people, 749 of whom were cancer-free at the time of the study, with no diagnosis, and 878 of whom had been newly diagnosed with a disease.\n\nThe test was most accurate for diagnosing pancreatic, ovarian, liver and gallbladder cancers, correctly finding the diseases in at least four out of five patients.\n\nThe blood test found lymphoma and myeloma with slightly less accuracy, at 77% and 73%, and bowel cancer in two out of three patients. Lung cancer was detected in 59% of patients. Head and neck cancer was detected in 56% of patients.\n\nResearchers said their results showed promise in the approach of blood screenings for cancer, but noted further “clinical development” was needed.\n\nThe number of patients in whom cancers were detected was small. For example, although the test detected ovarian cancer with 90% accuracy, only 10 ovarian cancers in total were detected.\n\nNevertheless, researchers aim to develop a tool that could be used by for all people regardless of their family history. “Potentially this test could be used for everybody,” said Klein.\n\nProf Nicholas Turner from the Institute of Cancer Research in London described the findings as really exciting and as a possible universal screening tool. “Far too many cancers are picked up too late, when it is no longer possible to operate and the chances of survival are slim,” he said. “The goal is to develop a blood test, such as this one, that can accurately identify cancers in their earliest stages.”\n\nKlein added: “It is several steps away and more research is needed, but it could be given to healthy adults of a certain age, such as those over 40, to see if they have early signs of cancer.”']","The Guardian story not only misleads readers with a grandiose headline, it fails to provide readers with a balanced discussion of the significant limitations and harms that many experts consider salient when it comes to liquid biopsies.","This story is about one of several studies on so-called “liquid biopsies” that were presented at the 2018 annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Liquid biopsies are blood tests for possible markers of cancer in the blood. It’s an emerging technology (we have written about extensively) that has yet to be shown to be as clinically usefully as the current gold standard for confirming a cancer diagnosis: getting a tissue sample.
The Guardian story not only misleads readers with a grandiose headline, it fails to provide readers with a balanced discussion of the significant limitations and harms that many experts consider salient when it comes to liquid biopsies. The cost and availability of these specialized tests are neglected, as is the fact that the study mentioned has yet to be published.
What would have helped this article most of all would have been including an additional independent, critical voice that could speak to these likely reader concerns: Is this technology ready for widespread use? Is it as good or better as existing cancer screening methods? Who should get this test?

Available methods for men include condoms, vasectomies and withdrawal.\n\nBetter birth control options are needed for men. In 2012, 40 percent of all pregnancies worldwide were unintended, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\n""The study found it is possible to have a hormonal contraceptive for men that reduces the risk of unplanned pregnancies in the partners of men who use it,"" said one of the study\'s authors, Mario Philip Reyes Festin, MD, of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. ""Our findings confirmed the efficacy of this contraceptive method previously seen in small studies.""\n\nThe prospective Phase II single arm, multi-center study tested the safety and effectiveness of injectable contraceptives in 320 healthy men ages 18 to 45. The participants had all been in monogamous relationships with female partners between the ages of 18 and 38 for at least a year. The men underwent testing to ensure they had a normal sperm count at the start of the study.\n\nThe men received injections of 200 milligrams of a long-acting progestogen called norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) and 1,000 milligrams of a long-acting androgen called testosterone undecanoate (TU) for up to 26 weeks to suppress their sperm counts. Healthcare professionals gave the men two injections every eight weeks. Participants initially provided semen samples after eight and 12 weeks in the suppression phase and then every 2 weeks until they met the criteria for the next phase. During this time, the couples were instructed to use other non-hormonal birth control methods.\n\nOnce a participant\'s sperm count was lowered to less than 1 million/ml in two consecutive tests, the couple was asked to rely on the injections for birth control. During this period known as the efficacy phase of the study, the men continued to receive injections every eight weeks for up to 56 weeks. Participants provided semen samples every eight weeks to ensure their sperm counts stayed low. Once the participants stopped receiving the injections, they were monitored to see how quickly their sperm counts recovered.\n\nThe hormones were effective in reducing the sperm count to 1 million/ml or less within 24 weeks in 274 of the participants. The contraceptive method was effective in nearly 96 percent of continuing users. Only four pregnancies occurred among the men\'s partners during the efficacy phase of the study.\n\nResearchers stopped enrolling new participants in the study in 2011 due to the rate of adverse events, particularly depression and other mood disorders, reported by the participants. The men reported side effects including injection site pain, muscle pain, increased libido and acne. Twenty men dropped out of the study due to side effects.\n\nDespite the adverse effects, more than 75 percent of participants reported being willing to use this method of contraception at the conclusion of the trial.\n\nOf the 1,491 reported adverse events, nearly 39 percent were found to be unrelated to the contraceptive injections. These included one death by suicide which was assessed not to be related to the use of the drug. Serious adverse events that were assessed as probably or possibly related to the study included one case of depression, one intentional overdose of acetaminophen, and a man who experienced an abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat after he stopped receiving the injections.\n\n""More research is needed to advance this concept to the point that it can be made widely available to men as a method of contraception,"" Festin said.

""I think it was exciting that they were really able to show that stimulating that area was important for a certain kind of learning. It raises more questions, and many more experiments that can be done.""\n\nSeven patients awaiting possible surgery for the seizure disorder epilepsy had electrodes implanted in their brains to pinpoint the origin of their convulsions. The researchers followed them and found they were better able to recognize landmarks and to navigate routes more quickly in a video game featuring a taxi cab, virtual passengers and a cyber city. Patients played the role of cab drivers who picked up passengers and delivered them to one of six requested shops in the city.\n\nStimulation of the entorhinal cortex -- a region considered crucial to transforming daily experience into lasting memories -- produced the improvement, the researchers said.\n\nThe study is published Feb. 9 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDuring the video game task, participants learned their way around a virtual town with and without five-second periods of deep brain stimulation, and were tested for their ability to reach predetermined landmarks. Six patients showed a 64 percent reduction in ""excess path length"" -- the ideal path between destinations, which indicated better performance -- for locations that had been learned during periods of deep brain stimulation.\n\nFor five patients, navigation to each of the three stores learned during stimulation was faster and shorter than navigation to the three stores learned without stimulation, indicating a consistent effect, the study said. Stimulating the hippocampus -- a brain region next to the entorhinal cortex which helps form and store memories -- produced no effect during this experiment, however.\n\n""Critically, it was the stimulation at the gateway into the hippocampus, and not the hippocampus itself, that proved effective,"" senior study author Dr. Itzhak Fried, a professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said in a university news release.\n\n""Our preliminary results provide evidence supporting a possible mechanism for enhancing memory, particularly as people age or suffer from early dementia. At the same time, we studied a small sample of patients, so our results should be interpreted with caution,"" Fried added.\n\nCurrently, deep brain stimulation is used to control the tremors associated with Parkinson\'s, symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and some other psychiatric conditions, including depression.\n\nHaber noted that the brain damage that occurs with epilepsy, which can produce memory problems, is different than that resulting from Alzheimer\'s disease, in which the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are believed to contribute to nerve cell deterioration. So it\'s difficult to generalize this study\'s results to other diseases that affect memory, she said, and the research didn\'t show if effects of temporary deep brain stimulation last beyond the study period.\n\n""In these types of studies you think of things like this,"" Haber said, ""but how real it is, is something we\'re going to have to see. I think just trying to work out that there is some similarity in very simple learning [processes in the brain] is important.""\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about deep brain stimulation, visit the American Association of Neurological Surgeons.']",The readers of this story and the other one we reviewed ,"This story gives readers a good sense of the tentative nature of this research.

Some comparison to the size of the temporary memory boost provided by available drugs would have helped put the results of this test in better context.

""The results of ongoing research to develop more tailored treatment based upon a personalized assessment of risks and benefits is critical before recommending aspirin for preventing cancer,"" she said.\n\nMoreover, patients and their doctors need to consider the potential risks of taking aspirin, including stomach bleeding, Cao said.\n\nHowever, ""if considered alongside the known benefits of aspirin in the prevention of heart attacks and strokes, our data suggest the possibility that long-term regular aspirin use may have a significant benefit in prevention of the two leading causes of sickness and death in the U.S. and much of the world,"" she said.\n\nThe results of the study were to be presented Sunday at an American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia. The data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nFor the study, Cao and her colleagues collected data on 82,600 women enrolled in the Nurses\' Health Study in 1980 and 47,650 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study in 1986. The researchers collected data on aspirin use, risk factors for cancer and diagnoses of cancer.\n\nAfter up to 32 years of follow-up, about 20,400 women and 7,570 men developed cancer, the investigators found. Among men, prostate cancer was excluded.\n\nCao\'s team found that men and women who took a regular dose of aspirin (325 milligrams) two times a week or more had a lower risk of cancer overall than people who did not regularly take aspirin. The reduced risk was largely due to fewer cases of gastrointestinal cancers, including colon cancer, rectal cancer and esophageal cancer.\n\nRegular aspirin use was not associated with a reduced risk of other cancers. Specifically, no link was found between aspirin use and a lower risk of breast cancer, advanced prostate cancer or lung cancer, the researchers said.\n\nMoreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said.\n\nGetting the biggest benefit from aspirin required taking it for at least 16 years. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found. And the study only showed an association between aspirin use and gastrointestinal cancer risk, not a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThe association of aspirin with reduced cancer risk was the same for women and men regardless of race, history of diabetes, family history of cancer, weight, smoking, regular use of other painkillers or taking multivitamins, the study authors added.\n\nEric Jacobs, strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said the new study ""confirms the now well-established link between regular aspirin use and lower risk of developing certain cancers of the gastrointestinal tract -- cancers of the colon, rectum and esophagus.""\n\nSome, though not all, previous studies have indicated that aspirin might slightly lower risk of certain other cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer, he added.\n\n""Although aspirin is recommended for most people who have had a heart attack, and has some benefits for cancer risk as well, at this point the American Cancer Society does not recommend that people use aspirin specifically to prevent cancer because it is not clear that the benefits with respect to cancer outweigh the risks,"" Jacobs said.\n\nWhile not common, aspirin can cause serious, even occasionally fatal, stomach bleeding, even at low doses, he said.\n\n""People who are uncertain about whether they should be using aspirin should talk to their health care provider, who knows their personal medical history and can help weigh their individual risks and benefits,"" Jacobs said.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the U.S. National Cancer Institute for more on aspirin and cancer risk.']","With some wording changes and a few more statistics, this pretty good story about aspirin for cancer prevention would have become demonstrably better.","
This story delivers intriguing information about a study that corroborates a previously reported link between aspirin use and decreased incidence of cancers. It does a nice job in pointing out that the link does not necessarily mean there is a cause-and-effect relationship; however, that uncertainty is not appropriately reflected in the story’s own use of language. (The headline — “Aspirin may help ward off gastro cancers” — suggests a cause and effect relationship.) In addition, the story’s use of statistics will likely leave readers with an inflated sense of the possible benefits, and it missed describing one researcher’s financial ties to an aspirin maker — a potential conflict of interest.

The right dose varies so much that people must get frequent blood tests to adjust it, and even foods like leafy green vegetables can throw it off.\n\nThe new drug is rivaroxaban (riv-ah-ROCKS-ah-ban), already sold outside the U.S. as Xarelto for preventing clots during hip and knee replacement operations.\n\nThe study tested it against warfarin in 14,264 people with atrial fibrillation in 45 countries. Half had already had a stroke and the rest were at higher risk of one because of heart failure, diabetes or other conditions.\n\nAfter about two years\' follow-up, 269 patients in the group given rivaroxaban had a stroke or blood clot versus 306 people on warfarin. But such a small difference in a study this large is a draw, statistically, so the drugs are considered comparable.\n\nPeople on rivaroxaban were less likely to suffer serious bleeding in the brain. Rivaroxaban also didn\'t harm the liver — a problem that doomed an AstraZeneca blood thinner four years ago.\n\nIf approved, the drug would be sold by Johnson & Johnson\'s Ortho-McNeil division in the United States and elsewhere by Germany-based Bayer HealthCare AG. The federal Food and Drug Administration already is weighing whether to approve rivaroxaban for hip and knee surgery patients, and the companies plan to seek approval to sell it for the heart rhythm problem later this year.\n\nIn October, the FDA approved the first warfarin rival — Pradaxa, made by the German firm Boehringer Ingelheim. It costs about $7 a day wholesale compared to less than 50 cents for warfarin. But neither Pradaxa nor rivaroxaban interacts with food as warfarin does, or requires blood tests to adjust the dose. No price has been set for rivaroxaban, which is a daily pill versus twice a day for Pradaxa.\n\nWhich of the warfarin alternatives is better?\n\n""That\'s the inevitable question"" that only a new study comparing them in similar patients can answer, said Duke University\'s Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey, who led the rivaroxaban study.\n\nDuke\'s Dr. Robert Califf, a study co-leader, said his 84-year-old mother, who has struggled with warfarin, likely would switch to one of the new drugs ""because she can afford it.""\n\nThey and other study leaders have consulted for or received research support from the makers of rivaroxaban and other heart drugs.\n\nDr. Elliott Antman, a Brigham and Women\'s Hospital cardiologist who is vice chairman of the heart conference, said patients already are asking about Pradaxa, and that any warfarin alternative will appeal to people ""who want a better quality of life, free of the burden of having to have frequent blood tests.""\n\n""Warfarin is the gold standard,"" and rivaroxaban seems an ""attractive option,"" he said.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nHeart rhythm problem: http://tinyurl.com/25aj85s\n\nHeart Association: http://www.heart.org']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Overall, a solid report.  Could have been improved with more specific information on costs and harms.  And it should have reminded readers about the limitations of drawing conclusions from talks at scientific meetings. </span>","The story is based on a preliminary report presented at a scientific meeting.

For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45.\n\n""Because prostate cancer grows slowly, those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit,"" the society notes on its Web site.\n\nAmbivalence over the test hasn\'t been confined to the United States.\n\n""In Europe, we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get PSA testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge,"" agreed lead researcher Dr. Jonas Hugosson, a professor of urology at the University of Gothenburg.\n\nHowever, he believes that with the results of the new 14-year study, ""it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about PSA and its possibilities. Personally, I would recommend my friends check their PSA,"" Hugosson added.\n\nThe report is published in the June 30 online edition of The Lancet Oncology.\n\nFor the still-ongoing study, Hugosson randomly assigned some 20,000 men to either PSA screening once every two years or no screening. The men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study.\n\nMen whose PSA levels were above normal were offered more tests, such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies.\n\nOver 14 years of follow-up, deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men, compared with unscreened men, the researchers found. Overall, 44 of the men who had PSA testing died from prostate cancer, compared to 78 men who had not had been screened.\n\nAmong screened men, 11.4 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 7.2 percent of unscreened men. Of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study, the researchers noted.\n\nIn addition, men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage. In the screened group, 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared with 87 men in the unscreened group, Hugosson\'s team found.\n\n""Our study has a longer follow-up than previous studies, but shows that in those men invited [to the study], the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group. In men younger than 60 at study entry, the effect was even more pronounced -- only one-quarter of expected deaths occurred,"" Hugosson said.\n\nMoreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. However, since the benefit of PSA screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out, it still seems questionable to test PSA for men over 70, the researchers noted.\n\nDr. David E. Neal, a professor of surgical oncology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and author of an accompanying editorial, believes that, ""PSA testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms. By doing so, it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease.""\n\nThis study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains ""a blunt instrument,"" when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. ""We need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease,"" he said.\n\nIn the United States, PSA testing remains a routine part of most physical exams, according to Dr. Nelson Neal Stone, a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.\n\n""I would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a PSA test,"" he said. ""So it is more or less the standard to care in America to get a PSA done.""\n\nStone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers, which do not need to be treated. ""When we see patients with low-risk disease we don\'t treat them, we observe them,"" he said.\n\n""Younger men benefit most from screening, because they have the greatest risk of dying,"" Stone said. ""This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths.""\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Anthony D\'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston, added that ""people in good health will benefit from [PSA] screening, but people in poor health may not benefit at all."" That\'s because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.']","These are not easy issues to report on, but communicating the difference between all-cause mortality and prostate cancer mortality – and the difference between the number needed to be diagnosed to save one life and the number needed to be screened in order to save a life – is important.  And this story didn’t do that. "," This story reports on the results of one study examining the impact of using PSA testing to screen for prostate cancer.  Two significant factors were not  mentioned in this piece.  
Lastly – the story cast the study being reported on as being important new results about which ‘there has been a lack of knowledge’ when the study results are from just one site of a large multicenter European prostate cancer screening trial that previously (March 2009) reported a survival benefit with screening  – though of a lesser magnitude.

However, this phase 4 trial, which used Avastin (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy in a large population found these problems were minimal.\n\nPhase 4 trials are done after a drug is on the market, to look for any new problems.\n\n""Today we have a new option to treat non-squamous lung cancer, incorporating Avastin in chemotherapy regimens and in maintenance therapy,"" said lead researcher Dr. Lucio Crino, director of medical oncology at S. Maria della Misericordia Hospital in Perugia, Italy.\n\n""The practical implication is the possibility to incorporate Avastin with any chemotherapy regimen in the frontline therapy of metastatic non-squamous lung cancer,"" he added.\n\nThe report, which is funded by the maker of Avastin, F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., is published in the July 20 issue of The Lancet Oncology. The funder was involved in study design, coordination of data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report, the journal noted.\n\nAdvanced non-small-cell lung cancer is a common cancer that kills 1.18 million people every year worldwide, according to background information in the study. Avastin is a so-called monoclonal antibody that works by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor A, which stimulates the growth of the tumor\'s blood supply.\n\nWhen used as an adjunct to chemotherapy, Avastin had already shown cancer-fighting activity in two phase 3 trials, the researchers noted.\n\nFor the study, Crino\'s team studied Avastin in more than 2,200 patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. The patients were treated at centers in 40 countries around the world.\n\nThese patients were given the drug every three weeks along with standard chemotherapy, for up to six cycles. Patients were then treated with Avastin alone until the cancer began to progress (""maintenance"" therapy).\n\nThe researchers reported few clinically significant adverse events, meaning that most were no greater than what one would expect in the general population. One percent of patients experienced bleeding in the lungs and 4 percent had bleeding, Crino\'s group found.\n\nOverall, 3 percent of the patients died due to adverse events associated with Avastin. These included 1 percent who had blood clots and 1 percent who suffered bleeding.\n\nOther serious adverse events associated with Avastin were blood clots in the lungs and nosebleeds, low white blood cell counts, fever along with a low white blood cell count and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), all of which occurred in 1 percent of the patients.\n\nDr. Robert Pirker, from the department of medicine at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that Avastin ""can be safely given when certain precautions are taken.""\n\nHowever, several issues remain to be determined, including the optimal dose and the role of maintenance therapy with Avastin, he said.\n\n""In addition, it is unknown whether bevacizumab [Avastin] increases survival when added to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer,"" Pirker said.\n\nOverall, Avastin, like several other targeted agents have led to therapeutic advances in lung cancer, he added. ""Hurdles in clinical development do occur but -- as shown for bevacizumab -- can be overcome,"" Pirker said.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer at the American Lung Association, and professor of preventive medicine, internal medicine, physiology & biophysics at Stony Brook University in New York, called the study ""very good bread-and-butter clinical research.""\n\nThe efficacy of the drug has been proven previously, he noted, but this study provides an in-depth analysis of Avastin\'s safety profile under ""real life"" conditions, he added.\n\n""Too often this step is shortcircuited in the rush to market of a new drug and we have to await the laborious collection of after-market data to find the real dangers of many new drugs,"" Edelman said.\n\n""So, the researchers and sponsors are to be congratulated for doing this study. They find that there are real deleterious side effects but that they are manageable, and conclude the drug is worth using under the proper circumstances,"" he said.\n\nAvastin is in the spotlight Tuesday for another reason, as well. U.S. regulators could rescind approval of the drug for the treatment of breast cancer, based on follow-up studies reported Friday that failed to show the medication shrank tumors or extended lives, according to published reports.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday will ask a panel of outside experts to review the evidence on the Roche drug, the Associated Press said. It\'s possible the FDA will withdraw approval of Avastin as a breast cancer treatment.\n\nThe drug is also approved for lung, colon, brain and kidney cancer.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on lung cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']",Curious story at a curious time.  The storyline:  Avastin not harmful when used for certain lung CA patients.  Nothing about benefit. Would this have made news if it weren’t in the same week an FDA panel voted to withdraw approval for Avastin for treating breast cancer?,"This is a story reporting on a study which reported on the potential harms associated with the addition of the drug Avastin in patients with an advanced form of a specific type of lung cancer.  What the study showed and was reported in this story was that there were several individuals who experienced bleeding complications with Avastin added to their treatment.  The piece fails to indicate what benefit patients might hope to expect from the addition of this drug to their other treatment regimens.  Although the story was clear about the potential harms associated with this drug, it seems a little odd not to more fully explain that it is not yet known whether the drug will be helpful to patients with metastatic non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer – especially since the FDA announced this week that this drug does not demonstrate benefit when used to treat breast cancer. In the absence of information about the benefits, it is not possible to weigh the risk of harm against the potential for benefit.  This is an issue that should have been addressed in this story.

The research, conducted by scientists at Tohoku University in Japan, suggests that this type of therapy may also benefit humans.\n\nThe team, led by cardiologist Hiroaki Shimokawa, found that applying low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to the whole brain of the mice improved blood vessel formation and nerve cell regeneration without having obvious side effects.\n\n""The LIPUS therapy is a non-invasive physiotherapy that could apply to high-risk elderly patients without the need for surgery or anaesthesia, and could be used repeatedly,"" says Shimokawa.\n\nDementia affects about 50 million people worldwide, with 10 million new cases occurring every year. But there are currently no curative treatments available for vascular dementia or Alzheimer\'s disease, the most common causes of dementia. Also, the cells lining the brain\'s blood vessels are tightly packed, forming a blood-brain barrier that prevents large molecules from crossing into the brain tissue. This limits the types of drugs and cell therapies that could be made available to treat dementia.\n\nShimokawa and his team had conducted previous studies showing that LIPUS improved blood vessel formation in pigs with myocardial ischemia, a condition where there is reduced blood flow to the heart. Other studies have reported that LIPUS increases the production of proteins involved in nerve cell survival and growth, in addition to a role in promoting nerve regeneration. Focusing LIPUS treatment on a region in the brain called the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, has also been found to improve dementia in mice, but the details of how it does this need to be more fully investigated.\n\nThe Tohoku University team wanted to find out if whole-brain rather than focused LIPUS is effective in treating mouse models of dementia, and if it was, what was happening at the molecular levels to achieve this.\n\nThey found that cognitive impairment markedly improved in mice with conditions similar to vascular dementia and Alzheimer\'s disease when LIPUS was applied to the whole brain three times a day for 20 minutes each time. The mice with vascular dementia received the treatment on the first, third and fifth days following a surgical procedure that limited the brain\'s blood supply. The mice with a condition simulating Alzheimer\'s disease in humans received 11 LIPUS treatments over a period of three months.\n\nAt the molecular level, genes related to the cells lining blood vessels were turned on. Also, there was increased expression of an enzyme involved in blood vessel formation and a protein involved in nerve cell survival and growth.\n\nThe researchers conclude that their study, recently published in the journal Brain Stimulation, provides the first experimental evidence that whole-brain LIPUS therapy markedly improves cognitive dysfunctions without serious side effects by enhancing specific cells related to dementia\'s pathology.\n\nThe first clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the LIPUS treatment are already underway.\n\n###']",This news release focuses on a mouse study of an experimental ultrasound therapy for dementia-like condition in mice. It’s also an example of hype over a therapy with no known benefit in humans.,"This release by Tohoku University in Japan promotes a dementia-related study in mice, specifically a technique called low-intensity pulsed ultrasound, or LIPUS. It notes that previous research has looked at focused ultrasound on the brains of mice that were genetically engineered to simulate having Alzheimer’s disease, but notes LIPUS is a whole-brain ultrasound approach.
The research suggests the technique “improved blood vessel formation and nerve cell regeneration without having obvious side effects.” While the release itself was clear that the research was performed on mice, the headline is not; it seems to present as fact the existence of a safe, sound-based “healing” treatment for dementia patients, when this is absolutely not the case. (There currently is no known safe and effective treatment for dementia.) Headlines are extremely important to get right, since many media outlets today are pinched for resources and time and often follow the framing of news releases when publishing stories about studies.
The image accompanying the release is also misleading since it features a young man wearing headphones, when the study was not done in humans.

Similar programs have been used to treat depression, but this may be the first one tested to prevent it, the researchers say.\n\nOnline programs for mental health problems can be as effective as face-to-face treatment and offer some advantages: Low cost, available at any time and customizable. But they\'re not panaceas.\n\nIn this experiment, half of the participants were asked to do six half-hour-long exercises that were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy, which are techniques commonly used for in-person therapy.\n\nIn the cognitive behavioral therapy, participants were asked to identify positive activities they used to engage in and then are asked to actively plan those activities again. At the next session, participants reflect on their experiences.\n\nFor the problem-solving therapy, people were asked to create a list of the things that matter most to them in their lives and brainstorm on how to incorporate those things into daily life. They next were asked to categorize problems and worries into ""manageable"" and ""unmanageable""; the main focus in problem-solving therapy is to tackle those problems that are considered manageable.\n\nBoth cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy are intended to change negative thinking in order to alter mood and behavior.\n\nAfter completing each exercise, participants in the intervention group received written individualized feedback from an online trainer. The trainers did not offer any therapeutic advice, only motivation and encouragement to continue the exercises. Participants also could repeat the online sessions as often as they liked.\n\nThe control group received information about depression but was under no obligation to read it.\n\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers from Leuphana University in Lueneburg, Germany, recruited 406 people with subthreshold depression, which is defined as having some symptoms of depression but not enough to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. It was published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOf the 406 participants that began the study, 335 completed the telephone follow-up at the end of 12 months. Twenty-seven percent in the intervention group experienced depression compared with 41 percent in the control group.\n\nIt is unclear if the people who went on to develop major depressive disorder had experienced it before. Lead author Claudia Buntrock, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Leuphana, says that because the study only tracked participants\' mental health over the course of 12 months, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown.\n\nIt\'s also not clear if this kind of program could be scaled up. It took the trainers about 30 minutes to provide feedback for each session, and they also stayed in touch with participants via instant messaging, Buntrock says.\n\nOther experiments with online therapy have found that people didn\'t continue it if it wasn\'t guided by an actual human. One reason could be that when people are depressed, they can have a hard time getting motivated to do things.\n\n""More studies are needed to evaluate the preventive effects of unguided web-based interventions on the onset of major depressive disorder,"" Buntrock wrote in an email. Still, Buntrock seems pleased with the results, especially since the German insurance company BARMER GEK that sponsored the trial is now providing it to its customers.\n\n""I was surprised by the big response to our study,"" Buntrock wrote. ""And of course, I\'m surprised about what happens now; that a health insurance company offers the intervention to its members. It\'s a success story you might dream of when you start, but it actually seeing to happen is a great feeling.""']","This story includes a clear explanation of the study design and the quantified benefits of an online intervention to prevent depression, but it overlooked an important limitation to the study.","
The story looks at a study published recently in JAMA that found patients who were at risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) were less likely to experience MDD if they engaged in online self-help interventions, within a 12-month timeframe.
The story does a good job of describing the interventions and the bulk of the study design. However, the story doesn’t note that study participants could be on antidepressant medications, nor address whether the use of antidepressants may have skewed the results. The story also would have benefitted from an independent source, and a contextual comparison of this treatment to existing alternatives.

I have a ""mummy tummy,"" also known as ""mommy pooch."" You know, that soft jelly belly you retain after having a baby — it makes you look a few months pregnant.\n\nI\'ve tried to convince myself that the pooch is a valiant badge of motherhood, but who am I kidding? The pooch bothers me. And it turns out it has been causing back pain.\n\nSo when I hear that a fitness coach and doctor have come up with a technique that can flatten the pooch quickly and easily, I think, ""Why not?""\n\nA few weeks later, I\'m rolling out a yoga mat with a dozen other moms and pregnant women in San Francisco.\n\n""We will see a dramatic change,"" says Leah Keller, who leads the class.\n\n""You can easily expect to see 2 inches off your waist in three weeks of time,"" Keller says.

""And we found 100 percent of women achieved full resolution.""\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR Talia Herman for NPR\n\nOK! Wait a second. Two inches off my belly in three weeks? That sounds too good to be true. I decide to do a little digging into the science of mummy tummy and Keller\'s claim.\n\nPutting the six-pack back together\n\nIt turns out the jelly belly actually has a medical name: diastasis recti, which refers to a separation of the abdominal muscles.\n\nAnd it\'s quite common. Last year, a study from Norway reported about a third of moms end up with diastasis recti a year after giving birth.\n\n""This is such a ubiquitous issue,"" says Dr. Geeta Sharma, an OB-GYN at Weill Cornell Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nAnd it\'s not just a cosmetic problem. Diastasis recti can cause another problem for new moms: lower back pain.\n\n""People can start feeling some back pain because the core is weakened,"" Sharma says.\n\nThe Diastasis Recti During pregnancy, the abdominal muscles responsible for a ""six pack"" stretch apart (left) to accommodate a growing fetus. After birth, the muscles don\'t always bounce back, leaving a gap known as the mommy pooch.\n\nHow To Test For Diastasis Recti There\'s a simple way to see whether you have diastasis recti: Lie flat on your back with your knees bent. Put your fingers right above your belly button and press down gently. Then lift up your head about an inch while keeping your shoulders on the ground. If you have diastasis recti, you will feel a gap between the muscles that is wider than an inch.\n\nIn rare occasions, the tissue in the abdomen isn\'t just stretched, but it is also torn a bit. This can cause a hernia, Sharma says.\n\n""If there\'s a defect in a layer of tissue called the linea alba, then the bowel can poke through,"" Sharma says. ""That\'s going to be more dangerous.""\n\nA hernia may require surgery. ""So I will refer patients to a general surgeon to have a CT scan if there\'s really a true concern about a hernia,"" Sharma says.\n\nDiastasis recti arises during pregnancy because the growing fetus pushes the abdominal muscles apart — specifically the rectus abdominal muscles.\n\n""These are the muscles that give you a \'six pack,\' "" says Dr. Linda Brubaker, an OB-GYN at the University of California, San Diego. ""People think these muscles go horizontal across the belly. But they actually go vertical from head to toe.""\n\nThe rectus abdominal muscles should be right next to each other, on either side of the belly button, Brubaker says. ""There shouldn\'t be much of gap between them.""\n\nBut during pregnancy, a gap opens up between the muscles, right around the belly button. Sometimes that gap closes on its own, but other times, it stays open.\n\nThat leaves a spot in the belly where there is very little muscle to hold in your stomach and other organs, a spot that can be 1 to 2 inches wide. That lets the organs and overlying tissue bulge out — and cause mommy pooch.\n\nTo flatten the area, women have to get those abdominal muscles to realign. And that is where the exercises come into play.\n\nIf you search online for ways to fix diastasis recti, you\'ll turn up a deluge of exercise routines, all claiming to help coax the abdominal muscles back together.\n\nBut the quality of much of that information isn\'t good, Brubaker says. ""Some of it is actually potentially harmful.""\n\nEven some exercises aimed at strengthening the abdomen can exacerbate diastasis recti, says Keller, including simple crunches.\n\n""You have to be very careful,"" she says. ""For example, please don\'t ever again in your life do crossover crunches or bicycle crunches. They splay your abs apart in so many ways.""\n\nThat said, there are a few exercise programs for diastasis recti that many doctors and physical therapists support. These include the Tupler Technique, Keller\'s Dia Method and the MuTu System in the U.K.\n\nMost such courses, taught once a week for an hour in New York, San Francisco and at least a few other places, tend to run about four to 12 weeks and cost around $100 to $300. Some places offer online classes and videos, which are much less expensive.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends abdominal exercises for the perinatal period. But the organization\'s guidelines don\'t provide details — such as which exercises work best or how often women should do them and for how long.\n\nPlus, ACOG focuses more on preventing diastasis than on fixing the problem; it recommends strengthening the abdomen before and during pregnancy.\n\ntoggle caption Talia Herman for NPR\n\n""The best way is prevention,"" says Dr. Raul Artal, an OB-GYN at St. Louis University, who helped ACOG write its exercise guidelines for the perinatal period. ""The best way to do that is to exercise during pregnancy.""\n\nBut, as Sharma, the Cornell OB-GYN, points out, no one has really vigorously studied these various exercises to see whether they actually fix diastasis recti.\n\n""There\'s a general knowledge that exercise is going to help,"" Sharma says. ""But no one has really tested them in a standardized way.""\n\nIn fact, the few studies that have been done haven\'t been high enough quality to draw conclusions, researchers in Australia said a few years ago.\n\nSharma hopes to change that. A few years ago, she teamed up with Keller to start to gather some evidence on her technique.\n\n""We did a pilot study to see if the method is helpful for women,"" Sharma says.\n\nThe study was small — just 63 women. But the results were quite promising. After 12 weeks of doing Keller\'s exercise — 10 minutes a day — all the women had fixed their diastasis recti, Sharma and Keller reported at ACOG\'s annual meeting few years ago.\n\n""We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises,"" Sharma says. ""We love to see that there is something we can do to help women.""\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR Talia Herman for NPR\n\nNow Sharma says she is working to put together a larger study to really nail down when the exercise works and how well.\n\nTight and tighter\n\nBack at the class in San Francisco, Keller is taking us moms through the key exercise. It\'s surprisingly simple to do.\n\n""The exercise is a very small, very intense movement that\'s almost imperceptible,"" Keller says. ""OK. We\'re going to do another set.""\n\nSitting on the floor cross-legged, with our hands on our bellies, we all take a big breath. ""Let the belly fully expand,"" Keller says.\n\nAnd then as we exhale, we suck in our belly muscles — as far back as they\'ll go, toward the spine. ""Now we\'re going to stay here near the spine. Hold this position,"" she says.\n\nThen we take tiny breaths. With each exhale, we push our stomachs back further and further.\n\n""Tight, tighter,"" Keller chants, rhythmically.\n\nYou can do the exercise in several different positions, Keller says: sitting crossed-legged, sitting on your knees, standing with knees slightly bent, on all fours or laying on your side in the fetal position.\n\nThe key is to be sure your back is flat, and that you do the exercise 10 minutes each day, changing positions every two minutes or so. For the rest of the time, your belly is pulled all the way back into the spine.\n\n""The fingertips on the bellybutton are really important for this reason,"" she says. ""So you know that you\'re squeezing tight, tighter with the belly, and you\'re never bulging the bellybutton forward.""\n\nThis is our fourth week of class, and we\'ve been doing this same exercise on our own every day for at least 10 minutes. So it\'s judgment day. Time to see whether we\'ve flattened our bellies and resolved the diastasis recti.\n\nKeller pulls out a measuring tape and starts wrapping it around women\'s middles. She also has us lie down on the floor, so she can measure the separation in our abdominal muscles.\n\nOne by one, there is success after success. Several moms completely closed up their abdominal separations. Many lost inches from their bellies.\n\nOne woman had amazing results. ""Oh my goodness, you lost nearly four inches from your belly circumference,"" Keller exclaims. ""That\'s amazing!""\n\nHow did I fare? Well, after three weeks, I didn\'t completely close up the abdominal separation. My separation decreased from 1.2 inches to 0.8 inches.* But I did drop more than an inch from my belly circumference.\n\nAnd I am quite happy with the results. My abs are definitely firmer. And regularly doing this exercise brought a bonus benefit: My lower back pain has almost completely gone away.\n\n*I continued to do the exercises after the class had finished. I checked with in Keller three weeks later to have her measure my diastasis recti. At that point, the separation had dropped down to 0.6 inches, which meant technically I no longer have diastasis recti.']",A few more cautionary details would have helped the piece on this front.,"A reporter shares her personal experience taking an exercise class aimed at flattening what she calls her “mummy tummy,” the abdominal bulge more formally known as diastasis recti, a separation of abdominal muscles after pregnancy.
The story provides a lot of good details and explanations for the science behind the problem. Many sources were consulted for the story, and costs of the treatment were made clear. However, the story didn’t delve into the lack of research quite enough here–it posited one small, pilot study as fairly strong evidence that this method works. That may be the case, but that’s hard to know until more rigorous research is done, especially randomized research with a control group.

Another existing set of guidelines doesn’t call for screening in any children.\n\nScreening all children would “identify a number of children who are of very significant risk of premature heart disease,” said Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University in Morgantown, who led the new study.\n\nNeal said treating youth with cholesterol-lowering drugs, the so-called statins, would curb the risk that they went on to develop heart problems in middle age. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the Western world.\n\nBased on data from West Virginia, Neal and colleagues found that more than one percent of all fifth-graders had cholesterol levels that warranted drug treatment. But a third of those children didn’t have relatives with heart disease or high cholesterol, and so wouldn’t have been screened under the current guidelines, issued by the government’s National Cholesterol Education Program.\n\n“I have gradually become convinced that universal screening in children is not only preferable, but necessary,” said Neal. He added that although universal screening would be expensive, it would save a lot of money later on if heart disease could be prevented.\n\nBut not all scientists agree that screening is a good idea. For example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal expert panel, currently doesn’t recommend routine cholesterol screening in any children.\n\n“Unfortunately, there is no evidence that starting a ten-year-old on cholesterol-lowering drugs will prevent heart disease 40 years later,” said Dr. Michael L. LeFevre, a member of the task force.\n\nHe said statin treatment in children was still controversial, and that no long-term safety data existed.\n\nThe new study tapped into data from more than 20,000 children who had been screened at public schools in West Virginia over five years.\n\nMore than seven in 10 school kids had first-degree relatives with heart disease, and about one percent of those had “bad” cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) levels that might require drug treatment in addition to diet changes and exercise, according to the researchers.\n\nYet among the kids without heart disease in their family, the percentage of children who might benefit from treatment was closer to two percent than to one, meaning that family history didn’t seem to make a difference.\n\n“It is therefore prudent to implement universal screening in the pediatric population independent of family history,” the researchers conclude.\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/tat96m Pediatrics, online July 12, 2010.']","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">This story is a mixed bag. It is the shortest yet the best of the three reports </span>","1clip_filelist.xml""/>



 
 Yet there was still a key oversight. The lead sentence implies that more thorough screening would lead to improved health outcomes, even though the study did not examine that question. On the other hand, this story contains the strongest independent comment pointing out the lack of evidence about the effects of statin treatment on children who may have elevated cholesterol levels, but do not have heart disease.
It would be an interesting research project to have news consumers read all three stories we reviewed and to test their comprehension.

FDA ANNOUNCES NEW AGGRESSIVE DRUG ATTACKING ORIGINATING GENES,"['The age-old answer to inventing a cure for cancer hasn\'t quite happened yet, but science took another large leap forward. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday night it granted accelerated approval to Vitrakvi (larotrectinib), a treatment for adult and pediatric patients whose cancers have a specific genetic feature (biomarker).\n\nThis is the second time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker across different types of tumors rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated.\n\nIn layman\'s terms — it means doctors and researchers can attack cancer at the root of biographical markers in a body, rather than focusing on one point where a tumor originated, like the breast, colon or other cancerous organ.\n\n""Today’s approval marks another step in an important shift toward treating cancers based on their tumor genetics rather than their site of origin in the body,"" said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. ""This new site-agnostic oncology therapy isn’t specific to a cancer arising in a particular body organ, such as breast or colon cancer. Its approval reflects advances in the use of biomarkers to guide drug development and the more targeted delivery of medicine.\n\n""We now have the ability to make sure that the right patients get the right treatment at the right time. This type of drug development program, which enrolled patients with different tumors but a common gene mutation, wouldn’t have been possible a decade ago because we knew a lot less about such cancer mutations.\n\nThe early beginnings of larotrectinib was studied in three clinical trials that included 55 pediatric and adult patients with solid tumors that had an identified NTRK gene fusion without a resistance mutation and were metastatic or where surgical resection was likely to result in severe morbidity, according to the FDA\'s statement. These patients had no satisfactory alternative treatments or had cancer that progressed following treatment.\n\nLarotrectinib demonstrated a 75 percent overall response rate across different types of solid tumors. These responses were durable, with 73 percent of responses lasting at least six months, and 39 percent lasting a year or more at the time results were analyzed. Examples of tumor types with an NTRK fusion that responded to larotrectinib include soft tissue sarcoma, salivary gland cancer, infantile fibrosarcoma, thyroid cancer and lung cancer.\n\nVitrakvi received an accelerated approval, which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need using clinical trial data that is thought to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials are required to confirm Vitrakvi’s clinical benefit and the sponsor is conducting or plans to conduct these studies.\n\n""Using our breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval processes, we support innovation in precision oncology drug development and the evolution of more targeted and effective treatments for cancer patients,"" the FDA stated. ""This is especially true when it comes to pediatric cancers. We’re committed to continuing to advance a more modern framework of clinical trial designs that support more targeted innovations across disease types based on our growing understanding of the underlying biology of diseases like cancer.""\n\nCommon side effects reported by patients in clinical trials receiving Vitrakvi include fatigue, nausea, cough, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, vomiting, and increased AST and ALT enzyme blood levels in the liver.\n\nHealth care providers are advised to monitor patient ALT and AST liver tests every two weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly and as clinically indicated. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Vitrakvi because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Patients should report signs of neurologic reactions such as dizziness.']","This story relies on a news release, and it’s full of holes. Cost, harms, evidence, who might benefit — all go unaddressed.","This story is based on an FDA news release announcing the approval of a drug to treat cancer that springs from an abnormality called neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase, or NTRK, gene fusion.
The story accurately reports that Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) is the second drug approved for use based on a tumor biomarker, rather than where the cancer is located in the body.
However, it omits important information like the drug’s hefty price tag ($400,000 a year), its harms, the lack of evidence to show it prolongs life or improves the quality of patients’ lives, and the fact that it applies to a very small number of patients.
It’s also larded with generic statements extolling the virtues of targeted cancer therapies, with no comments from independent sources.

Cut It Out (Surgically)\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto.com iStockphoto.com\n\nAt 32, it just didn\'t make sense that Daniel Sheiner was exhausted literally from the moment he woke up. ""It didn\'t get any better over the course of the day, and I knew that was not normal,"" Sheiner says.\n\nSheiner is a software designer and programmer. His job suffered as a result of his fatigue.\n\n""I would miss conversations,"" Sheiner says. ""I would ask a question that had already been answered.""\n\nSheiner suspected he had sleep apnea because it ran in his family. But he was not overweight, which is the biggest risk factor for the disorder — some 60 percent to 90 percent of patients diagnosed with apnea have a body mass index, or BMI, over 28.\n\nA sleep study confirmed Sheiner had one of the worst cases of apnea his doctors had ever seen. After trying a number of different treatments, his doctors finally tried a surgery using robots to treat his stubborn apnea — with positive results.\n\n\'Gasping For Breath\'\n\nAccording to Erica Thaler, an ear, nose and throat surgeon at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Sheiner\'s sleep study found that he woke up about 112 times every hour. That meant Sheiner stopped breathing for at least 10 seconds about two times every minute.\n\nSleep apnea is a chronic and common sleep disorder. People with this condition stop breathing while sleeping.\n\nLike Sheiner, they often find themselves suddenly and repeatedly gasping for breath during the night. Their airway is clogged, sometimes because their tonsils and tonsilar tissue in the back of their throat are enlarged.\n\nThis was exactly the case for Sheiner.\n\n""Daniel\'s obstruction was both at the level of the soft palate and at the back of the tongue,"" Thaler says. ""He had very large tonsils, but his tonsil tissue was also enlarged in the palate area and also at the back of his tongue.""\n\nSheiner was put on a nighttime breathing machine. In bed he wore a face mask, which was connected to a tube that was connected to a device that pumped air into his nose and mouth.\n\nThe Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine, or CPAP, as it is often referred to, works for about half of all patients who try it. It can be cumbersome, Thaler says.\n\nBut Sheiner was extremely committed to trying it. In fact, he tried a number of different types of machines, but none of them worked.\n\nHanding Surgery Off To Robots\n\nSo Thaler suggested a type of robotic surgery currently used to remove cancerous tumors at the back of the throat. Thaler was starting to perform it on sleep apnea patients, to remove tonsils and excess tissue.\n\n""What the robot allows you to do is get into a small, confined space without using hands,"" Thaler says. ""Human hands are huge, and robot hands are tiny, and yet they can do exactly the same thing if you control them remotely.""\n\nSo, about a year ago, Thaler performed surgery on Sheiner, removing both his tonsils and excess tissue. Sheiner is one of only about a half-dozen patients to have this robotic surgery for apnea.\n\nAfter surgery, Sheiner says, ""it was a whole new life."" He had energy, an ability to focus and get things done. ""I find myself solving problems much more quickly and more confidently.""\n\nHe\'s exercising at the gym three times a week, lifting weights. He is also starting to experiment with recipes and cooking, something he had absolutely no energy or interest in doing before the surgery.\n\nSurgery Not For Everyone\n\nThe surgery Sheiner had isn\'t right for everyone. Rashmi N. Aurora is a sleep specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. She is also chairwoman of the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\n\n""I wouldn\'t send a middle-age obese man for surgery as their first option,"" Aurora says. ""I would say let\'s lose the weight; let\'s use CPAP and see a nutritionist; let\'s avoid the alcohol and let\'s see how you do."" The apnea can probably be taken care of with these noninvasive techniques, she says, and invasive surgery can be avoided.\n\nBut when she sees a young, thin person with severe apnea, Aurora says, surgery might be the answer.\n\n""The upper airway starts with the nose and mouth and runs down to the vocal chords, so there\'s a lot of room for obstruction to occur,"" Aurora says. Some patients may require surgery to remove the uvula or the tonsils or excess tissue, or all of them, she says. Then, there\'s surgery to remove blockage in the nasal passage.\n\nOftentimes, Aurora says, patients need a series of surgeries to completely treat apnea. And even then, success rates aren\'t high; they\'re effective only 20 to 30 percent of the time.\n\nThe only surgery proved effective more than 90 percent of the time is a significant and highly invasive surgery. Maxillomandibular advancement, or MMA, involves literally slicing the jaw in half and moving it forward in order to widen the patient\'s airway.\n\nFor patients with recessed chins, small jaws and airways narrowed by facial structure, this might be the surgery for them. But it can take nearly a year to recover, and many patients opt not to have it.\n\nThe ""new"" CPAP machines are more sophisticated, Aurora says. They\'re less cumbersome, less noisy and can actually ""sense"" the magnitude of blockage and adjust air pressure being blown into the nose or mouth, she says. Noninvasive measures are always the first lines of defense, she says.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">In general, the story provided a good overview of sleep apnea treatment options.  But, for our taste, too much time was spent on apparently rare robotic surgery – profiled in an extreme example. </span>","Strong points:
The independent expert’s perspective:  “I wouldn’t send a middle-age obese man for surgery as their first option.

Many studies have documented the lower risk of various cancers among people who eat more fresh produce, and avoid things like red and processed meat.\n\nBut the majority of those studies have focused on adults, and it’s becoming clear that many of cancer’s drivers start early in life, with genes and even with childhood exposures to potential carcinogens.\n\nTo investigate this further, Maryam Farvid, a research associate at Massachusetts General Hospital and a visiting scientist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and her colleagues decided to study how diet during adolescence might affect cancer risk. In a study reported in the BMJ, they plumbed the Nurses’ Health Study, a massive survey of nurses who filled out questionnaires on their diet and were followed for various health outcomes, including cancer.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nAbout half of the 90,000 women who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study also answered questions about their typical diet while they were teens. Those who reported eating nearly three servings of fruit a day on average had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who ate half a serving of fruit.\n\nMORE: With Early Breast Cancer Treatment, Less May be More: Studies\n\nCertain fruits seemed to confer the biggest protection against breast cancer — apples, bananas and grapes were associated with the greatest reduction in risk while kale and oranges in adulthood also contributed to reduced breast cancer risk.\n\nFarvid says that apples, bananas and grapes contain fiber, which could help to lower cancer risk; they are also high in flavonoids, which act as antioxidants to combat damage to cells that can trigger abnormal growth. Kale and oranges are high in vitamin C, another antioxidant.\n\nMORE: Mediterranean Diet With Olive Oil Linked to Lower Breast Cancer Risk\n\n“This study underscores the importance of what a young girl eats for her future health,” says Farvid. “This study also has an important message for schools and the need to provide students with the opportunity to consume more fruits and vegetables as part of the school meal program.”\n\nFarvid wasn’t able to document a strong relationship between vegetables and lower breast cancer risk, but says that may be because the study wasn’t powered enough to detect an effect.\n\nThe findings are among the first to look at how diet during adolescence can affect health later, and highlights the importance of establishing healthy habits from a young age, especially since many of the chronic diseases occur over many years and get rooted early in life.\n\nThe results also underscore the importance of eating whole fruit, rather than fruit juice. In the study, Farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk; that may be because fruit’s anti-cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit, which is stripped out of juice. In the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, however, government nutritionists equated servings of whole fruit with fruit juice. “We recommend whole fruit and not fruit juice,” says Farvid, “because maybe one of the most important ways that fruit decreases risk of breast cancer is through fiber, and even natural fruit juice often has no fiber in it.”\n\nGet The Brief.

The added risk of cancer, however, was counterbalanced by a lower risk of heart disease.\n\nTaken together, the results show how critical diet can be in modulating risk of breast cancer.

A healthy diet and breast cancer risk reduction are worthy topics, but the story doesn’t touch on some important points — such as the fact that a previous study in Pediatrics by the same researchers, using the same cohort data, pointed to adolescent dietary fiber intake as a significant factor in reducing breast cancer risk. We also were confused by the data discussion: What does a 25% reduction actually mean? Without absolute numbers, we’re just not sure.

The women completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for 18 years.\n\nDuring the study period, 405 participants had heart attacks. Women who ate the most blueberries and strawberries were 32 percent less likely to have a heart attack, compared to women who ate berries once a month or less. This held true even among women who ate a diet rich in other fruits and vegetables.\n\nThis benefit was independent of other heart risk factors such as advancing age, high blood pressure, family history of heart attack, body mass index, exercise, smoking, and caffeine and alcohol intake. The findings appear online Jan. 14 in the journal Circulation.\n\nThe study can\'t say specifically what about the berries seemed to result in a lower risk of heart attack among these women, or that there was a direct cause-and-effect link between eating the berries and lowered heart attack risk. But blueberries and strawberries contain high levels of compounds that may help widen arteries, which counters plaque buildup, the researchers said. Heart attacks can occur when plaque blocks blood flow to the heart.\n\n""Berries were the most commonly consumed sources of these substances in the U.S. diet, and they are one of the best sources of these powerful bioactive compounds,"" said study lead author Aedin Cassidy. ""These substances, called anthocyanins -- a flavonoid -- are naturally present in red- and blue-colored fruits and vegetables, so they are also found in high amounts in cherries, grapes, eggplant, black currants, plums and other berries.""\n\nMen are likely to benefit from eating berries as well, although this study included only women, said Cassidy, who is head of the department of nutrition at Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, in England.\n\nAlthough more research is needed to confirm these benefits, ""these data are important from a public health perspective because these fruits can be readily incorporated into the habitual diet,"" the study concluded.\n\nDr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, noted that this was a ""huge study that followed women for a long period of time. Women who ate three or more servings of strawberries and blueberries per week decreased their heart attack risk by one-third. This is pretty compelling.""\n\nSteinbaum\'s advice to both women and men is to include berries in their diet, and make them part of their daily fruit and vegetable fill.\n\nOne serving of blueberries or strawberries equals about one cup.\n\nDana Greene, a nutritionist in Boston, regularly tells her patients to consume more fruits and vegetables, including berries.\n\n""They are so good for you,"" Greene said. Besides flavonoids, berries also are loaded with other nutrients, including vitamin C, potassium and folate.\n\n""I tell all patients to make sure that half of their plate is filled with fruits and vegetables, especially richly colored ones like blueberries and strawberries,"" Greene said. ""Berries can also help people lose weight and maintain that loss because they feel fuller faster. There is no downside.""\n\nThe study was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the U.K. Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.\n\nMore informationf\n\nWhat does a heart attack look like in women? Find out at the American Heart Association.']","The HealthDay story failed on many fronts – no mention of the study’s limitations, no mention of harms, and a touting of the benefits of berries without further discussion of the evidence. 2 stars here, 3 for ","The main failures of the story are caution in interpreting observational studies and failure to consider alternative hypotheses, such as that potassium from the berries may have accounted for this finding.
The story never mentioned that such observational studies – based on people keeping a diary of habits and self-reporting – has innate limitations.  And they cannot prove cause and effect – only a statistical association.  These are significant omissions.  We offer a primer on this topic that would help journalists and the public. 
Another limitation that was not discussed in the article was that researchers think that a specific compound called anthocyanin may be responsible for any reduced risk for heart attack that might be at play. But the problem is that they’re not completely sure, since the amount of anthocyanin in the body cannot be measured. They acknowledge that another compound may be responsible.
Then, there were the things that were not mentioned in the story – no discussion of prior research, harms, study limitations and alternatives.

Arthur Barsky, a psychiatrist at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, says patients need to change how they experience symptoms — typically pain, insomnia and anxiety. When patients adopt a more positive attitude, Barsky points out, it often translates into greater confidence and more energy.\n\nA study published this year in the Lancet found that a form of talk therapy, as well as exercise, offered relief for some patients. Researchers from the United Kingdom looked at cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT.\n\nIn the study, over 600 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome were assigned to different treatments. All of them received medical care for symptoms like pain, insomnia or anxiety.\n\nHear Joanne Silberner\'s Report Medical Mystery Of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Returns\n\nOne group got counseled about how to pace activities. Another took part in an exercise program. And a third received the cognitive behavioral talk therapy. The therapy and the exercise group improved the most, reporting less fatigue, insomnia and anxiety.\n\nBarsky says his patients do best when cognitive behavior therapy is also combined with gradually increased exercise. ""People need to begin to push themselves in the face of their fatigue, because if you don\'t, you become deconditioned and you get caught in a cycle which ... makes fatigue worse,"" says Barsky.\n\nBut he cautions against overdoing it. People should start with mild, gentle exercise like clearing the table, doing the dishes, or taking the dog for a short walk. Then, slowly build up to longer and more frequent walks, he says.\n\nLucinda Bateman is a doctor at the Fatigue Consultation Clinic in Salt Lake City who specializes in chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nShe\'s skeptical about the Lancet study, pointing out that patients improved only moderately, and not much more than those who were counseled about pacing themselves. Bateman suggests her patients pace themselves, and try to do only as many activities as they can manage.\n\nShe says some patients get caught in a ""push and crash"" cycle. When symptoms abate and they feel better, they may go all out, exercising, doing errands and socializing. But soon that level of activity often comes to a crashing end and patients can relapse dramatically, even becoming bedridden for several days or longer.\n\nBateman takes also issue with CBT\'s implication that chronic fatigue syndrome is psychosomatic. We still don\'t know what exactly causes the syndrome. And, like most professionals who treat patients, Bateman eagerly awaits the day when science can finally pinpoint its cause.\n\nWith additional reporting from Joanne Silberner']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">There are too many “somes” and not enough sums in this story about a study on cognitive behavior therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome.

Now, it may be good for the brain as well.\n\nA study published in this month's issue of the Archives of Neurology found that the diet might protect against blood-vessel damage in the brain, reducing the risks of stroke and memory loss.\n\nIt's the first study to specifically examine the effects of the diet centered around vegetables, fruits, fish, whole grains, nuts, olive oil and a moderate amount of alcohol, with limited consumption of red meat, sweets and refined grains like white bread or white rice—on the brain's small blood vessels.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested adhering to a Mediterranean-style diet is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn the latest study, researchers, led by a group at the University of Miami in Florida and Columbia University in New York, analyzed food questionnaires filled out by nearly 1,000 people participating in a larger, ongoing Northern Manhattan Study. These participants were categorized into groups based on how closely they adhered to an ideal Mediterranean-style diet, said Clinton Wright, one of the researchers and an associate professor of neurology at Miami's Miller School of Medicine.\n\nResearchers then used magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scans of the brain to look for what are called white matter hyperintensities, which show up as small lesions on the scan and indicate damage to small blood vessels.

Those who consumed more monounsaturated fat, which is found in olive oil, had lower white-matter hyperintensity volumes on their brain scans.\n\nDr. Wright cautioned that the study doesn't prove that a Mediterranean-style diet causes less brain damage and said more study is needed.

Along with obesity, high levels of blood fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems, including diabetes.\n\nThe U.S. government currently recommends screening for high cholesterol in children with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol (with at least one parent or grandparent who has suffered a premature heart event such as heart attack or stroke, or at least one parent with total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL). The guidelines also recommend that youngsters whose parents are not aware of their family history of heart disease be screened. (See how to prevent illness at any age.)\n\nIn the new study, led by Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University, scientists observed a group of more than 20,000 fifth-graders in West Virginia and found that 71% were eligible for cholesterol screening based on national criteria. Experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol \x97 and therefore of future heart disease. Based on the results of the screen, doctors may then advise families to change their children\'s diet or exercise routines or prescribe medication to lower their cholesterol.\n\nBut because West Virginia has one of the nation\'s highest rates of death from heart disease, since 2000, the state has offered free, universal cholesterol screening to all fifth-graders enrolled in public schools. That allowed Neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines. (See TIME\'s special report on how to live 100 years.)\n\nAmong the 5,798 children who would not have been screened, nearly 10% had elevated LDL cholesterol levels (above 130 mg/dL), according to the study, published in the August issue of Pediatrics. And 1.7% had levels high enough (above 160 mg/dL) to warrant cholesterol-lowering medications. Indeed, of all the children in the study whose LDL levels were above 160, one-third were in the group who would not have been screened.\n\nThe current guidelines were put in place in the 1990s, and at the time, experts predicted that high cholesterol would be missed in as many as 25% of children, says Neal. But doctors assumed that in most cases, these children would have only slightly elevated cholesterol levels that would eventually be detected when they became adults and would be lowered with diet and exercise.\n\nNeal\'s data show that may not be the case. Further, Neal says, the findings apply not only to heart-disease risk but also to the risk of diabetes, since high cholesterol at a young age is a strong predictor of prediabetes and diabetes. ""We worry about that because if these children don\'t change their ways, then they are going to have Type 2 diabetes,"" he says. ""It\'s something we would become more aware of if more children were screened.""\n\nNot everyone agrees that universal screening is the answer. Rather than calling for all youngsters to have their cholesterol tested, which would entail considerable expense on the national level, Dr. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association (AHA), suggests looking more critically at current screening guidelines. ""Maybe the way we are doing family screening, with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol, is not effective,"" he says. ""I think we need more effective screening tools. We need to assess these options before jumping to possible universal screening.""\n\nSacco notes that both the AHA and the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend cholesterol screening in children with risk factors for heart disease other than family history, such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. ""The weight of the child, his waist circumference and whether he has siblings who are overweight would help to select a group that is at greater risk of having high cholesterol,"" he says. ""Now that we have this data, it does call into question these original guidelines from the government."" The next update of the recommendations is expected in spring 2011.\n\nSee TIME\'s Pictures of the Week.']",Weakest of the three stories we reviewed on this study.  Shared some of the flaws of the ,"1clip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/>



 
The lead sentence of this story contains a factual error about the results of a study that looked at the percentage of children with elevated cholesterol who are likely to be missed by common screening guidelines. It also states that the “U.S. government” recommends screening children with a family history of heart disease or elevated cholesterol without making clear that this recommendation comes from the National Cholesterol Education Program, but that other national health institutions, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, do not recommend cholesterol screening for children.
As with the HealthDay story on this study that we also reviewed, the news article concentrates on debate between experts about the most efficient form of cholesterol screening of children. All of the experts quoted take the position that identifying elevated cholesterol in children leads to better health outcomes. The Reuters story we reviewed was the only one of the three to scrutinize the fundamental question about the effectiveness of treating children who have elevated cholesterol, but not actual heart disease.

Taking tamoxifen for five years after diagnosis reduces breast cancer mortality by about one-third.\n\nIn the new study, women with early tumors who took tamoxifen for 10 years cut their risk of dying from breast cancer by another 29%, compared to women who stopped after five years.\n\nIn absolute terms, 12% of women on tamoxifen for 10 years died of breast cancer within five to 14 years after diagnosis, compared to 15% of those who stopped at five years.\n\nOverall, women who take tamoxifen for a decade cut their risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half, compared with those who don\'t take it at all, says study co-author Richard Gray of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\nThat\'s significant, given that tamoxifen is used by hundreds of thousands of women worldwide, says Gray, whose study was presented Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Oxford funded the study, which included more than 6,800 women from 36 countries, While tamoxifen delays tumor growth in some women, it appears to cure others, Gray says.\n\n""This is a dream come true for women,"" says V. Craig Jordan, a researcher who led tamoxifen\'s development, but who wasn\'t involved in the new study. ""It\'s very exciting.""\n\nTamoxifen, which has been used for decades, is far cheaper than most new chemotherapies and biological drugs, which cost thousands of dollars a month. A generic version costs about $100 a month in the USA, according to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.\n\nIn the U.K., tamoxifen costs only $5 a month. In India, it\'s 2 cents a pill, says Jordan, scientific director at Georgetown\'s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nJordan says the new findings will quickly change care for some patients.\n\nYounger women with more aggressive tumors may want to extend their tamoxifen use, says Jennifer Litton, an assistant professor at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn\'t involved in the study.\n\nTamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says.\n\nDoctors may not want to change the care of older patients, however, she says. That\'s because postmenopausal women have the option of tamoxifen or another class of hormonal therapies, called aromatase inhibitors, or AIs. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don\'t work before menopause, Litton says.\n\nBecause the study didn\'t include AIs, doctors can\'t say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who\'ve taken them, Litton says. Other researchers are conducting trials comparing five versus 10 years of AIs, although these results won\'t be out for several years.\n\nGray noted that tamoxifen has risks. In his study, doubling the length of treament also doubled the risk of endometrial cancer, which affects the uterine lining, to about 3%. However, because this cancer is very treatable, death rates were low: 0.4% of those on tamoxifen for 10 years died of endometrial cancer, compared to 0.2% of those taking it for five years.\n\nDoctors saw no increase in strokes, which has long been a concern with tamoxifen, Gray says.\n\nBreast cancer survivors have mixed reactions to the results.\n\nSome women will be glad to have another treament option, says breast cancer survivor Lillie Shockney, 59, administrative director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer Survivorhip Program in Baltimore.\n\n""Patients get very nervous when they stop any hormonal therapy, because they feel like now they aren\'t doing anything,"" says Shockney, 59. ""The opportunity to \'do something\' might be appealing, despite the side effects.""\n\nShockney says she\'d like to see research on other ways to prevent recurrences, such as weight loss. ""If someone lost 40 pounds, would that do as much as another five years on tamoxifen?"" Shockney asks.\n\nSome patients may be reluctant to prolong their use of a drug that causes so many side effects, says Boston breast cancer survivor Alicia Staley.\n\nStudies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says. Some switch to an AI, although these drugs can also cause problems, such as joint pain and osteoporosis.\n\nStaley say she tamoxifen gave her ""many, many side effects,"" including severe hot flashes. ""Dry eyes, joint pain, weight gain — you name it, I had it,"" she says.\n\nAfter 2½ years, Staley and her doctor stopped the drug ""to regain a measure of quality of life.""\n\nFor Shockney, tamoxifen took a heavy toll on her marriage, causing dryness that made sex unbearably painful.\n\nPatients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship, she says.\n\n""If we are going to look at giving women tamoxifen for 10 years, by golly, we better get the partners involved,"" Shockney says.\n\nYet Shockney says her husband of nearly 35 years would have wanted her to do everything possible to survive.\n\n""If someone said to my husband, \'I know this has been a rough road for you, and a big impact on your sex life, but if she stays on it another five years. it could affect her survival,\' he would have said, \'Please, please, take the pill.\' ""']","Two women with breast cancer, trained in how to evaluate medical evidence, thought this story wasn’t as good as the ","Among our reviewers’ biggest concerns about this story were:

Partial sleep deprivation (sleep for three to four hours followed by forced wakefulness for 20-21 hours) was equally as effective as total sleep deprivation (being deprived of sleep for 36 hours), and medication did not appear to significantly influence these results. The results are published today in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.\n\nAlthough total sleep deprivation or partial sleep deprivation can produce clinical improvement in depression symptoms within 24 hours, antidepressants are the most common treatment for depression. Such drugs typically take weeks or longer to experience results, yet 16.7 percent of 242 million U.S. adults filled one or more prescriptions for psychiatric drugs in 2013. The findings of this meta-analysis hope to provide relief for the estimated 16.1 million adults who experienced a major depressive episode in 2014.\n\nPrevious studies have shown rapid antidepressant effects from sleep deprivation for roughly 40-60 percent of individuals, yet this response rate has not been analyzed to obtain a more precise percentage since 1990 despite more than 75 studies since then on the subject.\n\n""More than 30 years since the discovery of the antidepressant effects of sleep deprivation, we still do not have an effective grasp on precisely how effective the treatment is and how to achieve the best clinical results,"" said study senior author Philip Gehrman, PhD, an associate professor of Psychiatry and member of the Penn Sleep Center, who also treats patients at the Cpl.

""Our analysis precisely reports how effective sleep deprivation is and in which populations it should be administered.""\n\nReviewing more than 2,000 studies, the team pulled data from a final group of 66 studies executed over a 36 year period to determine how response may be affected by the type and timing of sleep deprivation performed (total vs early or late partial sleep deprivation), the clinical sample (having depressive or manic episodes, or a combination of both), medication status, and age and gender of the sample. They also explored how response to sleep deprivation may differ across studies according to how ""response"" is defined in each study.\n\n""These studies in our analysis show that sleep deprivation is effective for many populations,"" said lead author Elaine Boland, PhD, a clinical associate and research psychologist at the Cpl. Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center. ""Regardless of how the response was quantified, how the sleep deprivation was delivered, or the type of depression the subject was experiencing, we found a nearly equivalent response rate.""\n\nThe authors note that further research is needed to identify precisely how sleep deprivation causes rapid and significant reductions in depression severity. Also, future studies are needed to include a more comprehensive assessment of potential predictors of treatment outcome to identify those patients most likely to benefit from sleep deprivation.\n\n###\n\nThis research was funded by National Institutes of Health grants (R01 HL102119, P30 NS045839, R01MH107571, R01MH098260, P41 EB015893, R01 MH080729), National Aeronautics and Space Administration grants (NNX15AK76A, NBPF02701, NNX08AY09G, NBPF03401, NBPF02501, NNX14AM81G, NX16AI53G), National Heart, Lung, and Brain Institute (U01 HL125388), National Institute on Drug Abuse (1 R21 DA040902-01A1), the Office of Naval Research (N00014-11-1-0361), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNX14AN49G), National Space Biomedical Research Institute through NASA (NCC 9-58), and grant support from Merck and Philips Healthcare/Respironics.\n\nIn addition to Gehrman and Boland, additional authors include Rachel V.

Partial sleep deprivation, or sleeping for three to four hours, followed by forced wakefulness for 20 to 21 hours appeared equally as effective as total sleep deprivation (being deprived of sleep for 36 hours). The release says that the analysis provided very helpful details on effectiveness in “many populations” but it does not give us any examples of the populations grouped by gender, age or ethnicity that were studied. Most importantly, it doesn’t note that measured benefits were extremely short-term in most patient volunteers who found their gains were reversed after the next full night’s sleep.

That much larger, government-funded study of hormone therapy was halted in 2002 because the risks of heart disease and stroke seemed to outweigh the benefits.\n\nThose findings had sparked concern among women who turn to hormone therapy to alleviate the symptoms of menopause. The women in the WHI were older—on average 63 years old—and largely a decade or more past menopause, and critics suggested women closer to menopause might get more benefit with less harm. Nevertheless, use of estrogen and progesterone in the U.S. dropped by more than half between 2001 and 2009, according to IMS Health, a health-care technology and information company.\n\nThe new study ""will be reassuring to many people who were anxious about using estrogen for short-term therapy, particularly health-care providers who were nervous about their patients taking this,"" said Mary Jane Minkin, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine, one of the study\'s eight sites.\n\nThe trial, known as Keeps, for Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study, was funded by the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a nonprofit organization in Phoenix that conducts research on age-related diseases.\n\nThe four-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 727 women aged 42 to 58 who were within three years of the onset of menopause. They received either a low-dose estrogen pill (one made with horse estrogen) or a skin patch (one with estradiol, made from plants but closer to what women\'s bodies make) or a placebo.\n\nWomen on estrogen also took a natural progesterone; the WHI used a synthetic form.\n\nNeither type of estrogen had any significant impact on blood pressure, coronary calcium levels or atherosclerosis, as measured by ultrasounds of the carotid artery—key markers of cardiovascular health. Researchers speculated that was because the women were generally healthy and yet at an age where such problems are rare.\n\nWomen taking estrogen in pill form had an increase in HDL or ""good"" cholesterol, and a decrease in LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol, but an increase in triglycerides. Women on the patch had an improvement in insulin sensitivity, making them less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes.\n\nWomen on both forms of estrogen reported fewer hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings, as well as an improvement in bone density.\n\nA second branch of the study, funded by the National Institute of Aging, found that estrogen in pill form, but not the patch, improved symptoms of depression, anxiety and tension, without causing memory or cognitive ability, which the WHI had found in older women.\n\nResearchers said those findings underscored the need for women and their doctors to make individual decisions about whether to go on hormone therapy and if so, which kind.\n\n""A woman who has low HDL cholesterol and borderline high LDL and has some mood symptoms, might find some advantages on the oral estrogen, whereas a woman who has [high risk for Type 2 diabetes], some excess weight, might benefit from the [skin patch] form,"" said JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston and one of the lead Keeps researchers. The researchers , who haven\'t yet submitted the findings for publication, plan more analysis on the impact of hormone therapy on breast density They also say they hope to continue monitoring the participants for any future effects on heart disease, cancer or cognitive function-whether they continue to take hormones or not.\n\nMargery Gass, executive director of the menopause society, and who wasn\'t involved in Keeps, said it confirmed her group\'s view on hormone therapy: ""There seems to be very small risks for healthy women at menopause."" But, ""there is no strong evidence that women should be taking it long-term.""\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com']",Our reviewers felt the story exaggerated the study’s findings. ,"A new trial called the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) contradicts findings from the well-known Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), by showing that a different form of estrogen and progesterone given early after menopause did not cause harmful changes in arteries that might lead to heart attack or stroke. The main purpose of this trial of hormone therapy was to see if, when given close to menopause, it might help protect arteries from changes that could lead to future heart attack and stroke. The researchers reported a negative trial result: the hypothesized benefit wasn’t present. The study was not an endorsement “supporting” estrogen.
The results showed that there was NO effect, beneficial or harmful, on “hardening of the arteries” in the blood vessels supplying the brain and the heart. The story fails to point out the intermediate endpoints that look at risk factors for heart attack and stroke (such as cholesterol, and signs of thickening or calcium deposits in arteries) are not what we care about, which is whether heart attacks and strokes were any more or less common. Since it takes longer to detect such events, the researchers chose to look at markers for future disease rather than cardiovascular events. That’s a legitimate way to explore a hypothesis, but must be emphasized as preliminary. Don’t forget that we got into the widespread but misguided practice of prescribing estrogen for cardiovascular prevention back in the 80s based on just such assumptions, based on data that showed HT had favorable effects on cholesterol and other markers–yet in the end it caused more heart attacks and strokes.

Because rates of vitamin D insufficiency rise during the winter in many parts of the world, researchers have been interested in whether the vitamin might play a role in people’s susceptibility to colds, flu and other respiratory infections.\n\nSome past research has indeed found that people with relatively lower vitamin D levels in their blood tend to have higher rates of respiratory infections than those with higher levels of the vitamin, said Dr. Ilkka Laaksi of the University of Tampere in Finland, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\nAlong with that evidence, recent lab research has shown that vitamin D may play an “important role” in the body’s immune defenses against respiratory pathogens, Laaksi wrote in an email to Reuters Health.\n\n“However,” the researcher said, “there is a lack of clinical studies of the effect of vitamin D supplementation for preventing respiratory infections.”\n\nFor the current study, Laaksi’s team randomly assigned 164 male military recruits to take either 400 international units (IU) of vitamin D or inactive placebo pills every day for six months — from October to March, covering the months when people’s vitamin D stores typically decline and when respiratory infections typically peak.\n\nAt the end of the study, the researchers found no clear difference between the two groups in the average number of days missed from duty due to a respiratory infection — which included bronchitis, sinus infections, pneumonia, ear infections and sore throat.\n\nOn average, men who took vitamin D missed about two days from duty because of a respiratory infection, compared with three days in the placebo group. That difference was not significant in statistical terms.\n\nHowever, men in the vitamin D group were more likely to have no days missed from work due to a respiratory illness.\n\nOverall, 51 percent remained “healthy” throughout the six-month study, versus 36 percent of the placebo group, the researchers report.\n\nThe findings, Laaksi said, offer “some evidence” of a benefit from vitamin D against respiratory infections.\n\nStill, the extent of the benefit was not clear. While recruits in the vitamin group were more likely to have no days missed from duty, they were no less likely to report having cold-like symptoms at some point during the study period.\n\nMoreover, recent studies on the usefulness of vitamin D for warding off respiratory ills have come to conflicting conclusions.\n\nA study of Japanese schoolchildren published earlier this year found that those given 1,200 IU of vitamin D each day during cold and flu season were less likely to contract influenza A. Of 167 children given the supplement, 18 developed the flu, compared with 31 of 167 children given placebo pills.\n\nOn the other hand, a recent study of 162 adults found that those who took 2,000 IU of vitamin D everyday for 12 weeks were no less likely to develop respiratory infections than those given placebo pills.\n\nLaaksi said that larger clinical trials looking at different doses of vitamin D are still needed before the vitamin can be recommended for curbing the risk of respiratory infections.\n\nIn the U.S., health officials recommend that adults up to the age of 50 get 200 IU of vitamin D each day, while older adults should get 400 to 600 IU. The upper limit is currently set at 2,000 IU per day; higher intakes may raise the risks of side effects.\n\nSymptoms of vitamin D toxicity are often vague and include nausea, vomiting, constipation, poor appetite and weight loss. Excessive vitamin D in the blood can also raise blood pressure or trigger heart rhythm abnormalities.\n\nSome researchers believe that people need more vitamin D than is currently recommended, and that intakes above 2,000 IU per day are safe. However, exactly what the optimal vitamin D intake might be remains under debate.\n\nFood sources of vitamin D include milk, breakfast cereals and orange juice fortified with vitamin D, as well as some fatty fish, like salmon and mackerel. Experts generally recommend vitamin pills for people who do not get enough of the vitamin from food.\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/dan53n Journal of Infectious Diseases, online July 15, 2010.']","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">This story about a test of whether vitamin D supplements could reduce the risk of colds and other respiratory illnesses would have scored higher if the careful and cautious body of the piece had not been betrayed by the tantalizing headline and lead sentence.</span>","1clip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/>



 
The story points out that the results of the study provided only weak support for the idea that vitamin D has a protective effect and that in fact for the main outcome of this trial there was no statistically significant difference between the participants given vitamin D and those who took placebo pills. It almost feels as if the writer or editor wondered why they were doing the story at all and then decided to gussy up the headline and lead in order to justify running the piece. After all, a headline saying “Study unable to tell whether or not vitamin D helps fight colds” isn’t likely to attract as many readers.
One alternative approach to the story might have been to focus on what this trial adds to the body of evidence suggesting that the winter dips in vitamin D levels (because people don’t get as much sunlight) may help explain why colds and flu are more common in the winter. That story frame could have attracted interest without hyping the trial results.
In sum, this is a careful story undone a bit by a careless head.

Prevalence\n\n• 1 in 110 U.S. children is diagnosed with autism. Boys are four times more likely than girls to have autism.\n\n• 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have an autism spectrum disorder Diagnosis\n\n• Less than a decade ago, the disease was diagnosed at age 3 or 4. Now it is routinely diagnosed at 2.\n\n• Symptoms range from mild to severe. Many people with autism display rigid routines and repetitive behaviors. Treatment\n\n• There is no single treatment for children with autism. Most respond best to structured behavioral programs. Cost\n\n• Lifetime cost of caring for a child with autism: $3.5 million to $5 million\n\n• Annual U.S. cost: $90 billion Source: Autism Society of America and Autism Speaks A popular autism diet free of cereal grains and dairy products did not improve symptoms in children, shows a small study to be reported Saturday. Up to a third of children with autism are put on special diets like the one tested in the new study, the researchers say. The diets are based on the theory that people with autism don\'t digest cereal grains and dairy products completely, so they tend to absorb toxic byproducts. ""Subsequent studies have not confirmed this to be true,"" says Susan Hyman, a University of Rochester pediatrician who led the new study, which she\'ll report at the International Meeting for Autism Research in Philadelphia. Still, many parents and teachers say they\'ve seen improvement when children with autism stop eating these foods. But, Hyman says, behavioral therapy, not their diets, might deserve credit. The scientists say theirs is the most tightly controlled autism diet study so far. They tried to ensure that their subjects were as similar as possible, cutting the chance that factors besides diet would affect symptoms. Fourteen children with autism, ages 2½ to 5½, completed the 18-week study. None had celiac disease, in which the lining of the small intestine is damaged from gluten, or milk allergies. COURT: Thimerosal in vaccine didn\'t cause autism AUTISM: More likely in kids of older parents VIDEO: Rethink Autism helps families Their families stuck to a strict diet free of gluten — proteins in wheat, rye, barley — and casein, the main protein in milk and other dairy products. After they had been on the diet for at least four weeks, they were ""challenged"" once a week with a snack containing wheat flour, non-fat dried milk, both or neither. Dietitians created snacks that looked, tasted and felt the same, whether they contained gluten or casein. Every child received each snack three times. Parents, teachers and a research assistant completed standardized surveys about their behavior the day before they received the snack, then two hours and 24 hours afterward. Parents also kept a diary of their children\'s diet and their sleep and bowel habits. The researchers assessed social interaction and language by watching taped play sessions. They found no adverse changes in behavior after the snacks containing wheat, milk or both. ""This is a small study,"" Hyman acknowledges. ""Families will continue to try the diet, and that\'s OK."" But, she says, they must ensure their growing children receive adequate nutrition. Pamela Compart, co-author of The Kid-Friendly ADHD and Autism Cookbook, calls the study ""clean and well thought out."" But, says Compart, a pediatrician in Columbia, Md., who trained with Hyman, researchers may have seen behavioral changes if they had looked 72 hours after the snacks or if they also had eliminated soy from kids\' diets. ""If you\'re able to keep them well-nourished, I think it\'s worth every child trying it,"" Compart says of the special diet. ""People would not stay on this diet if they didn\'t think it was working."" Hyman and Compart agree on the need for further scientific investigation into the role of diet in autism.

The magnetic stimulation costs up to $10,500 for a six-week regimen of care, is not yet covered by insurance, and may not work for many patients.\n\nThe therapy, which carries a slight risk of seizures, is meant for patients with major treatment-resistant depression who do not respond to at least one medication. Still, the technology has enabled Neuronetics to get funding from Quaker BioVentures, a Philadelphia-based venture capital firm that invests in life-science companies.\n\nQuaker\'s current $700 million in committed capital is funding innovative treatments across the region.\n\nIn Conshohocken, NuPathe has developed Zelrix, an active, single-use patch for the treatment of migraines as an alternative to oral drugs, which often have severe side effects, said chief executive officer Jane Hollingsworth. The company hopes to start selling the patch in 2012 if it gains FDA approval.\n\nTarsa Therapeutics, which is based in Philadelphia, is marketing an oral dosage of a drug called Calcitonin for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\nNear Neuronetics in Malvern, TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals has been shrinking tumors with proteins, trying to avoid the killing of normal cells that occurs with most cancer treatments.\n\nAnd in Bristol, NB Therapeutics says it believes it has solved the delivery problems for the drug Lamisil, used to treat onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection that affects 35 million people in the United States, CEO Frank McCaney said.\n\nQuaker BioVentures is not the only firm investing here. Polaris Venture Partners and Pfizer, which both back early-stage life-science companies, have funded some of these firms, including TetraLogic and Neuronetics.\n\nPolaris director Kevin Bitterman said the decision to invest $30 million in Neuronetics was based largely on the fact that this was a ""classic example of a team working in groundbreaking technology.""\n\nQuaker BioVentures founding partner Sherrill Neff said his firm ""saw this as a huge opportunity where we could provide safer and more durable treatment in a market which has millions and millions of patients.""\n\nThe numbers are certainly significant. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 9 percent of U.S. adults have depression, including 3.4 percent with major depression.\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, John O\'Reardon directs the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Program. He also ran a Neuronetics-funded trial that helped the product gain FDA approval in 2008. Penn does not use Neuronetics\' unit but does employ the technology, conducting more than 1,500 sessions per year, often on difficult cases. ""We\'ve been pretty satisfied with the results,"" O\'Reardon said. ""As a treatment, it has been very effective in major depression, which is where it has FDA approval.""\n\nMore than 4,000 patients have received NeuroStar treatment since its 2008 debut.\n\nNeuronetics does not report sales figures or profits, and NeuroStar is its only product so far. Still, the company says its U.S. employees have risen from 30 to 130 in the last two years.\n\nNeuroStar TMS Therapy uses the same technology as MRI machines, which have been widely used around the world.\n\nPatients get five sessions a week for four to six weeks, and remain awake during the 37-minute session. The cost varies across the country, but is generally about $350 per session. Most patients undergo 20 to 30 sessions, putting the cost at between $7,000 and $10,500.\n\nPsychiatrists themselves pay $70,000 for the system, and Neuronetics provides training and technical support. So far doctors are offering it in Bryn Mawr, Wayne, Huntingdon Valley, Philadelphia, Newtown Square, and Mount Laurel. A full list is at www.neuronetics.com\n\nThe new treatment is not a panacea. One study found that, of patients who failed to benefit from one antidepressant medication, just one-third responded adequately to a second. TMS produced a similar response rate (as does talk therapy, according to other studies), although the effect was described as greater.\n\nSide effects of the treatment include temporary headaches (which were reported by half the patients in one study) and slight discomfort during the actual treatment (reported by a third).']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Some things were done very well in this story but other needs – like quantifying benefits, evaluating evidence and seeking independent perspectives – were not addressed. </span>","We love all the cost information in this detailed and fairly well reported story.

That effect was maintained for 30 days.\n\nAmong the 11 women who took the placebo, just one experienced remission within 60 hours.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInterestingly, none of the patients who took the drug reported psychiatric side effects, such as abnormal dreams, insomnia, and anxiety — but 5 of the 11 women on the placebo reported such symptoms. A few patients in each group experienced dizziness or a sedative effect.\n\nSage’s drug is designed to change the traffic patterns in the brain. There’s a natural push and pull between neurotransmitters called NMDA receptors and the GABA receptors that regulate their flow in the brain. In cases of severe depression, that equilibrium gets out of whack, and Sage’s drug is meant to restore it, modulating those GABA receptors to allow NMDA to do its job.\n\nThe data could represent a “paradigm shift in how the disease is thought about,” CEO Jeff Jonas said in a conference call.\n\nBut before anyone shifts anything, Sage will need more data. The early results are “promising and exciting,” said Dr. Allison Baker, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital’s Center for Women’s Mental Health, but “we need to see replication of this data over a much wider range in terms of numbers.”\n\nThe study is small and has not been peer-reviewed; Sage disclosed the results in a press release. The company has not submitted study data to federal regulators and isn’t at this point seeking approval of the drug, known as SAGE-547, for postpartum depression. Its next steps: expanding the trial to enroll more women and to determine optimum doses.\n\n“I think it’s incumbent upon us … to find a lower dose that might be just as useful,” especially for nursing mothers, Jonas said.\n\nWomen in the trial were asked not to breastfeed for the first 10 days after receiving the injection. The drug has a “very, very short half-life” in the body, Jonas said, meaning that it can be metabolized quickly.\n\nThe company is also testing SAGE-547 as a treatment for a rare form of epilepsy. It’s in late-stage trials on that front. It’s also working on an oral form of the drug.\n\nThough preliminary, the early results on postpartum depression are tantalizing. One of the drug’s most promising features: It appears to work quickly — some women in the study started experiencing relief after 24 hours. By contrast, traditional antidepressants can take weeks to begin working. The only other treatment for postpartum depression is talk therapy.\n\nSAGE-547’s apparent speed is what’s getting the most attention in the psychiatric community, Baker said. In the early days of motherhood, women ideally build competency and confidence in their parenting. Dealing with postpartum depression derails that process, and it’s linked to increased rates of anxiety and mood disorders among children, she said.\n\n“If we could essentially nip those within 60 hours or even 24 hours and then keep that at bay for at least 30 days, that’s pretty compelling when you think of the alternative,” Baker said.\n\nA serious mood disorder that affects as many as 1 in 7 women after childbirth, postpartum depression can lead to panic attacks, inconsolable sadness, and deep feelings of inadequacy. Some women have thoughts of harming their baby or themselves.\n\nJonas, a Harvard-trained psychiatrist, has long experience working with treatments for mental illnesses such as depression. He wrote the book “Everything You Need To Know About Prozac” in the early 1990s, in part to counter fear-mongering about the antidepressant.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.']",The news coverage of the study findings was great for the drug company–its stock price soared–but the benefit to women remains unknown.,"
This is story about a small, early test of a new type of drug to treat postpartum depression.
The story is careful to note the preliminary nature of the findings and that the only source is company statements, since the study report has not been submitted for peer-review.
However, it is hard to see the health news in a tiny phase 2 study, especially when no independent sources are included in the story to help provide balance to the claims. As readers, we’re also left wondering about potential harms specific to pregnant and new mothers, such as the drug’s ability to affect a baby in utero or pass through breastmilk.

This new study shows that ovarian tissue transplants are safe and effective and pose little risk of the cancer coming back, the Danish researchers said.\n\n""This procedure is gaining ground worldwide as an optional fertility treatment for fertile female cancer patients who after cancer treatment most likely will be infertile,"" said lead researcher Dr. Annette Jensen, from the Laboratory of Reproductive Biology at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen.\n\nWith this procedure, many women who survive cancer should be able to become pregnant and have healthy children, Jensen said.\n\nOf 32 women who had ovarian tissue frozen and transplanted in this study, 10 women -- or 31 percent -- had a child, she said.\n\nMany young cancer patients today can expect to live a normal lifespan. Their focus shifts from survival to quality-of-life, explained senior researcher Dr. Claus Yding Andersen, a professor of human reproductive physiology at the University of Copenhagen. ""Here, fertility is very important to many young women,"" he said.\n\n""The tissue restores ovarian organ function, and women regain menstrual cycles and sex hormone levels that will avoid menopause,"" Andersen added.\n\nDr. Avner Hershlag, chief of the Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the new research ""innovative and exciting.""\n\nSimultaneous advances in cancer treatment and reproductive medicine have made these scientific leaps possible, he said.\n\nHowever, Hershlag said he would like to see a pregnancy rate above 31 percent. ""The pregnancy rate with frozen embryos is close to 50 percent, and results are getting better,"" he said, referring to another option for women hoping for a future pregnancy. ""It remains to be seen which method is better.""\n\nThe Danish report was published Oct. 7 in the journal Human Reproduction.\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the outcomes of 53 transplantations of thawed ovarian tissue in 41 Danish women. The investigators followed the women for 10 years, looking at ovarian function, fertility and safety.\n\nThe women\'s average age when the tissue was removed and frozen was nearly 30. Average age of the first transplant was 33.\n\nThirty-two of the women attempted pregnancy. Ten were successful and had at least one child -- 14 children in all.\n\nEight children were conceived naturally, and six with the help of in vitro fertilization, the researchers reported.\n\nTwo women had abortions, one because she was separating from her partner and the other because her breast cancer recurred. Another woman had a miscarriage, the researchers said.\n\nFor three of the mothers, more than 10 years had passed since the ovarian tissue transplantation. In six cases, it was more than eight years. And for 15 of the women, transplantation had taken place more than five years earlier, the researchers said.\n\nAlthough three women had a relapse of their cancer, these relapses did not appear related to the tissue transplantation. And no cancer developed in the transplanted tissue, Jensen said.\n\n""So some of these women will still be able to have more children and avoid menopausal symptoms,"" she said, noting two more pregnancies have been reported to her laboratory since the study\'s publication.\n\nNot all women are eligible for ovarian tissue transplants, however. ""In particular, we have not performed transplants in patients who have suffered from leukemia, because the ovarian tissue may harbor cancer cells,"" Jensen said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on fertility and cancer treatments, visit the American Cancer Society.']",This 4-star story benefits from several borderline “satisfactory” ratings. Our review details what could have been done better.,"A small European study showed 31 percent of cancer patients had successful pregnancies after they received transplants of their own (once removed and frozen) ovarian tissue. A substantial number required additional measures, such as in-vitro fertilization.
Though solid overall, the coverage would have been measurably improved with inclusion of a few details, including information about costs and specifics about whether/where the procedure is available in the United States. We also quibble with one researcher’s description of the size of the benefit. The suggestion that “many” women will get pregnant using this procedure is somewhat misleading. The procedure led to a successful pregnancy in less than a third of the women who received it.

Often tied to obesity, type 2 diabetes involves a gradual decline in how insulin responds to changes in blood sugar (glucose).\n\nThe new drug, called TAK-875, is a pill designed to enhance the secretion of insulin in response to such changes, which means that it has no effect on insulin secretion when blood sugar levels are normal -- potentially reducing the risk for hypoglycemia.\n\nThe trial, led by Dr. Charles Burant of the University of Michigan Medical School, included 426 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not getting adequate blood sugar control through diet, exercise or treatment with the first-line diabetes drug metformin.\n\nThe patients were randomly assigned to receive either TAK-875 (303 patients), placebo (61 patients), or another diabetes drug called glimepiride (brand named Amaryl).\n\nThe study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical (which is developing the drug), and appears online Feb. 26 in The Lancet.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, all the patients taking the different doses of TAK-875 had significant drops in their blood sugar levels, the researchers said. A similar reduction occurred in patients taking glimepiride.\n\nHowever, the incidence of episodes of hypoglycemia was much lower among patients taking TAK-875 (2 percent) than among those taking glimepiride (19 percent) and the same as those taking the placebo (2 percent).\n\nThe incidence of treatment-related side effects was 49 percent among patients taking TAK-875, 48 percent among those in the placebo group, and 61 percent among those in the glimepiride group, according to the researchers. They write that they are ""excited about the potential of TAK-875 and are eager to conduct larger trials to find out how well this drug works, how safe it is and what its place is in the treatment of diabetes.""\n\nIn a journal commentary, Clifford Bailey of Aston University in Birmingham, England, cautioned that, ""on the journey to approval of a new class of treatment for type 2 diabetes, many questions will be asked of [drugs such as TAK-875],"" including questions of how long they might remain effective, as well as safety issues.\n\nOther diabetes experts had mixed views on the new findings.\n\nDr. Loren Wissner Greene is clinical associate professor of endocrinology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. She noted that glitazones -- a separate class of newer drugs such as Rezulin, Avandia and Actos that also target insulin resistance -- have all shown initial promise in clinical trials before worrisome side effects began to surface in users (due to concerns around heart risks, Avandia remains on the U.S. market but under limited distribution).\n\nAs for TAK-875, it targets a separate mechanism ""but again, until more is known about short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects, we need to proceed with moderated enthusiasm for each new drug and drug mechanism,"" Wissner Greene said.\n\nDr. Minisha Sood, endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City stressed that, ""given the rising global incidence of type 2 diabetes, the medical community is eagerly awaiting the development of novel agents to add to our existing armamentarium of anti-diabetic agents.""\n\nShe said that, ""though this study includes a small sample size followed for a short period of time, the results are promising in that TAK-875 appears to be effective for glycemic [blood sugar] control without significant risk for hypoglycemia or weight gain. However, like Wissner-Greene, Sood said that ""further investigation is warranted, especially including [heart disease] patients.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more about diabetes medicines.']",It’s challenging to distill a complicated study into a short space. HealthDay managed to capture much of the essential information of this preliminary clinical trial but missed two of the most important elements: a clear explanation of the benefits and harms.,"This story explains that the results are preliminary and gives readers the right basic information about the study, but the study’s findings and its limitations warranted more explanation.

It will manufacture lab-grown islets, the organoids responsible for insulin production, by reprogramming donated pancreatic tissue.\n\nOnly 30-50 people with type 1 diabetes in the UK currently receive an islet transplant each year, owing to a lack of donors and the difficulty of extracting islets from pancreatic tissue.\n\nGrowing islets will “significantly increase the number of patients who can receive the treatment,” Keith Thompson, CGT’s chief executive, told the World Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine congress in London on Wednesday. He will run Islexa with Michael Bennet from CGT and Anne Lewendon from Aberdeen University.\n\n\n\nIf clinical trials are successful, the technology means tens of thousands more people could live without the need for frequent insulin injections, although it will take a few years until the treatment is available.\n\nAbout 320,000 people in Britain have type 1 diabetes, a number set to more than double to 652,000 by 2035. Around the world, 21 million people have type 1 diabetes.\n\nIt is a lifelong condition that occurs when the pancreas does not produce any insulin, while type 2 diabetes – far more common, especially as obesity rises around the world – is a condition where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body’s cells do not react to it.\n\nProf Kevin Docherty, from Aberdeen University, said: “Donated islets are already effectively treating severe cases of type 1 diabetes. Having a hugely expanded supply of lab-grown islets will enable us to significantly extend this established clinical treatment.”\n\nCGT was set up in 2012 and is based on the 12th floor of Guy’s hospital in London. It employs more than 100 people and has government backing through Innovate UK but also gets private funding through partnerships. It is building a £55m cell therapy manufacturing centre in Stevenage. Islexa will use CGT’s labs at Guy’s and facilities at Aberdeen University.\n\nThey are looking for investors to take Islexa all the way as a fully fledged external company. The promising early results have given them the confidence to form a wider consortium with the Scottish Islet Transplant Programme, the University of Edinburgh and the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service.\n\n\n\nJohn Casey, consultant transplant surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and lead clinician for the islet transplantation programme in Scotland, said: “Islet transplantation can transform the lives of patients with type 1 diabetes, and in some cases can result in long-term freedom from insulin injections with excellent glucose control.”']","This story is problematic on several levels–it appears to be little more than a rehash of a news release, making a passing mention to successful “pre-clinical results” but offering no specifics.","This news story is about a new technology being developed in the UK that will grow pancreatic islet cells in a lab, as a possible treatment for type 1 diabetes patients.
There is news here: A consortium of non-profit, university, government funding and private investment is moving forward to bring hope to potentially tens of thousands of people with Type 1 diabetes.
But the story itself is problematic on several levels–it appears to be little more than a rehash of the news release, making a passing mention to successful “pre-clinical results” but offering no specifics. There is no discussion of the realities: Islet transplants are costly, carry adverse effects, can fail, and are complex to manage. How will this therapy differ? We’re not told.

Recommendations included cutting 500 calories a day, eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains by following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet approach, and exercising at least three hours a week.\n\nIn addition, the researchers asked the participants questions about sleep time, depression, insomnia, screen time and stress.\n\nDuring this part of the trial, the participants lost an average of almost 14 pounds. The 60 percent of the participants who lost at least 10 pounds went on to take part in the next phase of the trial. Those in the second phase of the trial continued their diet and exercise program.\n\nElder\'s team found the right amount of sleep and stress reduction at the start of the trial predicted successful weight loss. Lower stress by itself predicted more weight loss during the first phase of the trial, they added.\n\nDeclines in stress and depression were also important in continuing to lose weight during both phases of the trial, as were exercise minutes and keeping food diaries, Elder\'s group found.\n\nDr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine, said that ""while we often tend to look at health one condition at a time, the reality is that health is best viewed holistically.""\n\n""People who are healthy and vital tend to be healthy and vital not because of any one factor, but because of many. And the factors that promote health -- eating well, being active, not smoking, sleeping enough, controlling stress, to name a few --promote all aspects of health,"" he added.\n\nThis study shows that people are more likely to lose weight when not impeded by sleep deprivation, stress or depression, he said.\n\n""Anyone who has ever tried to lose weight probably could have said much the same from personal experience. Similarly, weight loss reduced stress and depression. This, too, is suggested by sense and common experience, as it is affirmed by the science reported here,"" Katz said.\n\nThe important message is that weight loss should not be looked at with tunnel vision, Katz said.\n\n""Improving sleep may be as important to lasting weight control efforts as modifying diet or exercise. Managing stress is about physical health, as well as mental health. This study encourages weight loss in a more holistic context,"" he said.\n\nAnother study presented earlier this month at the American Heart Association scientific sessions held in Atlanta found that people of normal weight eat more when they sleep less.\n\nColumbia University researchers discovered that sleep-deprived adults ate almost 300 calories more a day on average than those who got enough sleep. And the extra calories mostly came from saturated fat, which can spell trouble for waistlines.\n\nThe researchers came to their conclusions -- which should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal -- after following 13 men and 13 women of normal weight. They monitored the eating habits of the participants as they spent six days sleeping four hours a night and then six days sleeping nine hours a night (or the reverse).\n\n""If sustained, the dietary choices made by people undergoing short sleep could predispose them to obesity and increased risk of cardiovascular disease,"" the researchers wrote in an American Heart Association news release.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on obesity, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Better than its <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3769"" target=""_blank"">LA Times competition</a> because it provided more context.

The story should have challenged that call to action and explained the limitations of drawing conclusions from observational studies, but it didn’t.

The condition usually occurs when a blood clot travels from the legs to the lungs, sometimes with fatal results.\n\nBut with increasingly sophisticated tools, doctors may be spotting clots that would never have been fatal in the first place.\n\nOne such tool is called a CT chest scan, which produces detailed images with high-dose x-rays and is being used in millions of patients every year in the U.S.\n\nIn the years before 1998, when the technique was introduced, 62 per 100,000 Americans were diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism annually. After 1998, that number rose to 112 per 100,000.\n\nThe number of deaths caused by the condition dropped only little, however: from 12.3 per 100,000 in 1998 to 11.9 per 100,000 in 2006.\n\n“This is consistent with overdiagnosis of pulmonary embolisms that may have caused very little harm, may not have caused death,” said Dr. Renda Soylemez Wiener of Boston University, who worked on the study.\n\nOn the other hand, the blood-thinning drugs used to treat blood clots increase the risk of bleeding in the brain or gastrointestinal tract, for example.\n\nAccording to the new results, such complications rose from three to five per 100,000 people hospitalized with PE per year after doctors began using chest CT scans.\n\nThe new findings add to other evidence showing that medical testing is on the rise across the U.S., although in many cases the impact on overall health remains unclear.\n\nCT scans expose patients to radiation, for example, which can increase the likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the scan also cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.\n\n“I think doctors should think carefully about the pretest probability of a pulmonary embolism before they order this test,” Wiener told Reuters Health.\n\nYet there is no easy solution at this point, because untreated blood clots can be fatal, she added.\n\n“Right now, it is a difficult place for the patient to be in,” Wiener said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/mmZK9K Archives of Internal Medicine, online May 9, 2011.']",Overall good job in summarizing an important analysis in only 456 words.,"We identified three shortcomings – all easily addressed.

But they\'ve never all been connected before. This work, conducted by Jianghong Liu, Jennifer Pinto-Martin and Alexandra Hanlon of the School of Nursing and Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor Adrian Raine, reveals sleep as a possible mediating pathway, the potential missing link between fish and intelligence.\n\n""This area of research is not well-developed. It\'s emerging,"" said Liu, lead author on the paper and an associate professor of nursing and public health. ""Here we look at omega-3s coming from our food instead of from supplements.""\n\nFor the work, a cohort of 541 9- to 11-year-olds in China, 54 percent boys and 46 percent girls, completed a questionnaire about how often they consumed fish in the past month, with options ranging from ""never"" to ""at least once per week."" They also took the Chinese version of an IQ test called the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, which examines verbal and non-verbal skills such as vocabulary and coding.\n\nTheir parents then answered questions about sleep quality using the standardized Children Sleep Habits Questionnaire, which included topics such as sleep duration and frequency of night waking or daytime sleepiness. Finally, the researchers controlled for demographic information, including parental education, occupation and marital status and number of children in the home.\n\nAnalyzing these data points, the Penn team found that children who reported eating fish weekly scored 4.8 points higher on the IQ exams than those who said they ""seldom"" or ""never"" consumed fish. Those whose meals sometimes included fish scored 3.3 points higher. In addition, increased fish consumption was associated with fewer disturbances of sleep, which the researchers say indicates better overall sleep quality.\n\n""Lack of sleep is associated with antisocial behavior; poor cognition is associated with antisocial behavior,"" said Raine, who has appointments in the School of Arts and Sciences and Penn\'s Perelman School of Medicine. ""We have found that omega-3 supplements reduce antisocial behavior, so it\'s not too surprising that fish is behind this.""\n\nPinto-Martin, who is executive director of Penn\'s Center for Public Health Initiatives, as well as the Viola MacInnes/Independence Professor of Nursing and a professor of epidemiology in Penn Medicine, sees strong potential for the implications of this research.\n\n""It adds to the growing body of evidence showing that fish consumption has really positive health benefits and should be something more heavily advertised and promoted,"" she said. ""Children should be introduced to it early on."" That could be as young as 10 months, as long as the fish has no bones and has been finely chopped, but should start by around age 2.\n\n""Introducing the taste early makes it more palatable,"" Pinto-Martin said. ""It really has to be a concerted effort, especially in a culture where fish is not as commonly served or smelled. Children are sensitive to smell. If they\'re not used to it, they may shy away from it.""\n\nGiven the young age of this study group, Liu and colleagues chose not to analyze the details participants reported about the types of fish consumed, though they plan to do so for work on an older cohort in the future. The researchers also want to add to this current observational study to establish, through randomized controlled trials, that eating fish can lead to better sleep, better school performance and other real-life, practical outcomes.\n\nFor the moment, the researchers recommend incrementally incorporating additional fish into a diet; consumption even once a week moves a family into the ""high"" fish-eating group as defined in the study.\n\n""Doing that could be a lot easier than nudging children about going to bed,"" Raine said. ""If the fish improves sleep, great. If it also improves cognitive performance -- like we\'ve seen here -- even better. It\'s a double hit.""\n\n###\n\nFunding for this research came from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences grants R01-ES-018858, K02-ES-019878, K01-ES015877 and P30 ES013508, with additional support from the Intramural program of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.']",Observational studies that draw connections between health and food intake sometimes raise more questions than answers and need to be treated with a high degree of caution.,"Getty Images
This observational study drawing a link between higher fish consumption, better sleep and higher scores on an IQ test has many potential variables that could influence the research results. Those variables as well as alternative explanations for the outcomes observed should have been included in the news release.
While this is important research, appropriate caveats are missing here, and further details could have helped readers make better sense of the difficulties involved in this research. Note that this study was done in China, where the other aspects of a daily diet may differ markedly from those in North America.

Most significantly, research showed a significant effect in reducing the risk of death with ACE inhibitors but not with ARBS. That led many doctors and standards groups to conclude that ACE inhibitors were more effective than ARBs.\n\nBut some doctors and researchers were puzzled by the fact that in head-to-head comparisons between the two classes of drugs they appeared to equally safe and effective. If there really was such a big difference between the medications, why didn\'t it show up in these types of studies?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat inconsistency created a confusing split in the medical community. Most guidelines set forth by the major medical groups suggest starting a patient with an ACE inhibitor first, but the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) considers ACE inhibitors and ARBs to be equal.\n\nBangalore noticed that one assumption made in comparing the placebo trials -- that the patients in the group were about the same -- was incorrect. During that time period there was a remarkable shift in cardiovascular health care in America -- with a greater emphasis on not smoking, more statin use for cholesterol, better management of diabetes, lower targets for blood pressure.\n\n""The patients in the \'80s and \'90s were a higher-risk group than those in the 2000s,"" Bangalore explained.

If your risk is lower it\'s harder to show a benefit.""\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new analysis, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings on Monday, involves a second look at 106 randomized trials with 254,301 patients that took place after 2000 and shows that during this time period patient outcomes on the two medications were remarkably similar. The one difference they found was that ARBs tend to be better tolerated by patients, meaning that they have fewer side effects or result in fewer adverse events. ACE inhibitors are poorly tolerated by many patients because they can produce a bothersome dry cough, and some end up stopping medication as a result.\n\nBangalore said this is critically important because ""compliance is big issue with our patients.""\n\n""With hypertension they are on these medications for decades, and it\'s important to choose one that will be the most tolerable,"" he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe other piece of good news regarding the medications is that ACE inhibitors, as well as many ARBs, are now generic -- meaning that the cost difference is minimal.\n\nThe study was limited to patients who did not have heart failure, and because it involved a retrospective analysis of trials it was unable to control for differences in the design or data gathering of the previous work.\n\nRead more:\n\nFor more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.\n\nAD']",This story dug deeper than ,"This Washington Post story reports the findings of a study that compared the efficacy of two classes of drugs available to treat cardiovascular disease (CVD) — angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors versus newer angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs.  It involved a meta-analysis of more than 100 earlier studies monitoring more than a quarter-million patients who were at high risk for CVD.  The results showed the two types of drugs to be equally effective with the major difference being a lower chance of side effects with the use of ARBs.
With a bit more information on harms and a better grasp of the limitations of this study, the Post’s coverage is more solid than a competing HealthDay story that was based on a news release.

By contrast, the lifetime risk of breast cancer among women generally is about 12 percent, and for ovarian cancer, it\'s less than 2 percent.\n\nRoughly half of the women in the study had undergone either mastectomies (surgery to remove their breasts) or salpingo-oophorectomies (surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes) between 1974 and 2008, in order to proactively lower their risk of cancer. The women were followed for an average of about 3.5 years.\n\nDuring the follow-up period, no breast cancer events occurred in the women who underwent mastectomies, while 7 percent of the women in the group who didn\'t undergo surgery were diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nIn addition, women who had their ovaries removed lowered their risk of ovarian and breast cancer, and also lived longer than women who didn\'t have the surgery. For example, over 6 years of follow-up, no ovarian cancer cases were seen among BRCA2 mutation carriers who underwent salpingo-oophorectomy, compared with 3 percent of carriers who did not undergo the procedure, the researchers report.\n\n""One of the main messages of our study is that salpingo-oophorectomy should be part of any management plan for any woman who is found to have these genetic mutations,"" said Rebbeck. ""There really isn\'t anything else that can reduce a woman\'s risk by this much.""\n\n""These findings really emphasize how important it is for all women with a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer to undergo genetic testing,"" said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study. ""I see women all the time who get the genetic test only after they\'re diagnosed with cancer,"" said Kaklamani, who is director of translational breast cancer research at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, in Chicago.\n\nKaklamani added that she hoped the findings would encourage more women to ask their primary care physicians whether they are candidates for genetic counseling.\n\n""This is a very important study because it gives us more information in order to counsel women at risk,"" said Dr. Daniel Silver, assistant professor of medicine at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. Silver added that women who are found to carry one of these genetic mutations face ""a very complex set of considerations, so the more hard facts you can give them, the better.""\n\nAccording to Rebbeck, doctors usually recommend that women who test positive for the genes have their ovaries removed at around age 35, but are okay with putting it off until age 40 if they haven\'t finished having children. He said the surgery today is often done in an outpatient setting, with the use of laparoscopes, which limits scarring and shortens a patient\'s recovery time.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes at the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">This story does a generally acceptable job of describing the results of a study of women with an elevated risk of cancer connected to mutations in their BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and the effects of preventive surgery.

It is careful to make clear that the potential benefits of preventive surgery seen in the study apply only to women who carry these specific gene mutations. It provides readers with absolute percentages of cancer and death among the women in the study and not merely vague descriptions of the how the women who opted for surgery fared compared to those who did not. However, the story does not give readers much detail about the pros and cons of the options faced by women with these specific gene mutations. It would have been helpful for this story (and the three others we reviewed) to tell readers that the gene mutation is rare. It is present in less than 2 percent of the general population and less than 3 percent of those who have only a single relative who had breast cancer.

Natural remedies have an obvious appeal, but how do you know which ones to choose and whether the claims are backed by science? In this occasional series, the New York Times “Really?” columnist, Anahad O’Connor, explores the claims and the science behind alternative remedies that you may want to consider for your family medicine cabinet.\n\nThe Remedy: Honey\n\nThe Claim: It relieves coughing.\n\nThe Science: For decades, parents looking for an over-the-counter medicine to cure a child’s sickness and coughing have turned to syrupy medicines containing dextromethorphan, a popular cough suppressant found in products like Children’s Dimetapp DM and Robitussin DM.\n\nBut in 2007, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel declared the products potentially harmful in small children and recommended a ban on many of them. As an alternative, many experts suggest something as simple as a spoonful of honey or even a small cup of flavored water, which have few side effects and seem to be effective.\n\nThe thinking is that sweet substances of any kind help soothe the back of the throat and break up mucus in the airways. Honey is also known to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.\n\nIn one double-blind study published in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, researchers recruited 105 children and teenagers who had coughs from upper-respiratory infections. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: one that received no treatment, another that received one or two teaspoons of buckwheat honey, and a third that received a dose of honey-flavored dextromethorphan. Ultimately, the honey produced the greatest improvements when it came to better sleep and reduced cough frequency and severity.\n\nThe study was carried out by pediatricians at the Pennsylvania State University medical school and supported by a grant from the National Honey Board, an industry-backed agency of the Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn a similar study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004, researchers recruited 100 children with upper respiratory tract infections who had been coughing for an average of over three days. The children were given a cough syrup with dextromethorphan, a cough syrup containing an antihistamine, or a placebo, which was essentially flavored water. Although children in all three groups experienced a reduction in coughing, those who received the flavored water fared the best.\n\nThe Risks: According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under a year of age because in rare cases it can cause infantile botulism.']","This brief report comparing honey and sweetened water to over-the-counter cough remedies for children alerts parents to some relevant evidence, but it is so brief that key information is missing.","The story attempts to synthsize the available evidence on the value of honey as a treatment for cough in children. In doing so, it provides what is arguably incomplete and potentially misleading information to the consumer. The results of the 2007 paper, highlighted in the blog, should have been explained a bit more completely. Indeed honey did fair better than the active ingredient in most cough syrups, dextromethorphan. But statistically significant results don’t necessarily translate to the results parents can expect at 3 AM; that is, are the effects not only detectable by researchers, but substantial enough to make a difference that parents and small patients would really notice.

Neither the radiologists nor the pathologists knew whether the patients had dementia.\n\nIn 34 of the 35 patients, the PET scan, the pathologists’ report and the computerized pathology report agreed. In one patient who had Alzheimer’s, the pathologist and the radiologist analyzing the scan did not see much plaque, but the computerized analysis of the scan and the two autopsy reports did.\n\nAnd the data showed that the scans were completely accurate in ruling out Alzheimer’s pathology: unlike doctors, they never said people had Alzheimer’s pathology when they did not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition, the company scanned the brains of 76 younger people who would not be expected to have plaque in their brains.

We’re controlling the dosage and we’re keeping it there for a prolonged period of time.”\n\nThe patches could help treat conditions like chronic back pain, neuralgia and arthritis without the need to take potentially damaging doses of the drug orally. The team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off.\n\nAlthough TEPI patch remains highly tacky and adheres well to skin, it is not uncomfortable to peel off, unlike many traditional plasters.\n\nAccording to Andrew Lee, co-founder of Medherant, “we’ve only been in the lab about 12 months, but in the 12 months we’ve essentially assessed about 90 percent of the drugs that are currently available as either creams or patches. We’ve tested them in our polymers with very good results, we’ve been able to get increased loadings of drugs in the polymer and we’ve shown almost across the board that we can get a steady release rate of that drug from the polymer as well.”\n\nThe team says TEPI patches could go on sale within three years, and Medherant is working with some large, unnamed, pharmaceutical companies to get them ready for market.\n\nHaddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications, such as opioid painkillers. “What’s important is to be able to extend the range of drugs that are available by patches because at the moment we’re limited to about 20 different drugs, and there are thousands of drugs out there, and only about 20 are used in patches at the moment, which is limited by the technology of the adhesive, essentially,” he said.\n\nLee told Reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all, and merely sooth the body with a warming effect. He said Medherant’s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.\n\n“One of the interesting areas that we plan to explore in partnership with large companies is actually using our platform technology to include other drugs that previously maybe haven’t been suitable for topical or transdermal delivery - or drugs which may have not got through the regulatory filings because, for instance, they might have caused stomach irritation or other side effects when taken orally,” said Lee.\n\nThe TEPI patch incorporates new adhesive technology developed by global adhesive company Bostik. Lee believes ibuprofen strips could be useful for sports participants, helping alleviate conditions such as tendonitis, and repetitive strain injuries. Nutrition companies have also shown an interest in adapting Medherant’s technology for transmitting minerals and vitamins through the skin.']",There’s little if any proof provided to support the claims in this story about a new type of drug patch technology.,"To begin with, the headline of this story is a little much: a “side-effect free future” with this patch? Surely, we can’t dispense entirely with oral ibuprofen even if this patch were to deliver everything it promises. And while it makes sense that transdermal delivery would reduce stomach-related side effects, do we really know if this approach will eliminate other possible side effects that aren’t related to the GI tract — for example related to cardiovascular risk? The advantages of the TEPI patch (this apparent acronym is never spelled out in the story) over existing products on the market sound impressive and believable — although very little evidence is given to help us assess the quality of these claims.

She couldn\'t remember what to play next in Dmitri Shostakovich\'s Prelude and Fugue No. 15.\n\nSo she went back a few measures to redeem herself, only to get stuck in the same spot. Very upset, she thanked the panel and walked out.\n\nA year later, after getting into Northwestern University\'s Bienen School of Music as a graduate student, she was introduced to a ""little orange pill"" that she says helped launch her professional career.\n\nWhile beta-blockers have long been known as effective treatments for heart failure, many conservatory students and professional classical musicians use these drugs to relieve performance anxiety induced by their highly competitive and ""no-room-for-error"" line of work.\n\nAt the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, professor Hal Robinson praises beta-blockers as a great mechanism for anxiety relief and has no problems with students using them. But another professor, Joseph Silverstein, compares them to legalized steroids for the classically trained.\n\nBeta-blockers are at the center of a growing debate about the use of prescription drugs to enhance performance. An estimated 20 percent of American high schoolers told interviewers for the 2009 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey that they were taking the drugs for nonmedical uses.\n\nBeta-blockers, along with the stimulant Ritalin and some medicines for Parkinson\'s disease, are now considered ""smart drugs"" because some people believe they can boost alertness and improve test performance for high school and college students.\n\nA 1991 study investigated beta-blockers\' effectiveness on SAT performance for 32 students who had test anxiety. When given beta-blockers an hour before taking the SAT for the second time, the study found, the students scored an average 130 points higher than their drug-free first round. The normal increase would be about 30 points out of 1,600 total, the paper said.\n\nBeta-blockers have stirred up controversy in the sports world. The World Anti-Doping Agency listed them as a performance enhancer in 1999 and currently bans their use in 18 sports, from billiards to archery. In the first major doping scandal of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, North Korean pistol shooter Kim Jong-su was stripped of his silver and bronze medals after testing positive for the beta-blocker propranolol. And last spring, Swedish wheelchair curler Glenn Ikonen was suspended for taking metoprolol at the 2010 Paralympics in Vancouver.\n\nGolfers have been rumored to use beta-blockers to sharpen their focus and precision for putting. The PGA Tour banned beta-blocker usage in 2008 because ""it decreases tremors and steadies nerves, which could give a competitive advantage,"" says spokeswoman Ana Leaird.\n\nMusicians say many students choose to use the drugs more to calm themselves than intensify their playing.\n\n""Beta-blockers are not performance enhancers, at least not for musicians,"" says Curtis student Jessica T. Chang, who says she has never used beta-blockers but is now considering them after a shaky debut performance last year. ""Either you can play or not,"" the violist says, ""it just helps the anxiety go away.""\n\nKontorovitch, who says she has been diagnosed for performance anxiety, has been taking beta-blockers occasionally for nine years - and no longer performs without them. Though she has been playing piano since she was 5, the 35-year-old vocal accompanist at the Bienen School in Evanston, Ill., still gets stage fright.\n\n""It can be two people or 500 people, I become extremely anxious,"" she says. ""It\'s like an impending doom over my head. The thought of not being able to go back and fix mistakes makes me lose it.""\n\nBeta-blockers were created to reduce heart rate and blood pressure in patients who survived heart attacks or are at risk for cardiovascular problems.\n\nSince the Food and Drug Administration approved the first beta-blockers in the late 1960s, they\'ve been the most commonly prescribed drugs for heart failure and hypertension, accounting for $1.8 billion in U.S. sales in 2009, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company. They are sold under many names: metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL), propranolol (Inderal), and atenolol (Tenormin), among others.\n\nThe drugs were designed to keep specific proteins from binding to adrenaline. The combination activates the body\'s ""fight-or-flight"" response, causing increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and uncontrolled reflexes.\n\nThough people have short-term side effects such as lowered blood pressure from using the drugs, no catastrophic events have been reported.\n\nStill, research has not looked at long-term effects of use in healthy individuals - and the drugs can cause problems for those who use them for nonmedical purposes.\n\nAt Johns Hopkins University, cardiologist Lili Barouch recalled seeing a fellow doctor pass out while giving a speech because he had taken a beta-blocker for stage fright. Barouch warns that improper use can lead to dizziness and light-headedness from a drop in blood pressure, as well as wheezing for those with asthma. ""Please consult your doctor before taking this medication,"" she advises.\n\nSome music students do get their family doctors to write scrips for beta-blockers to help with anxiety. But sharing is also common.\n\nCellist Liz Zook admits to getting a beta-blocker from her friend before a final exam this past spring. ""I didn\'t shake nearly as much with it,"" says the Temple University undergraduate. She says she would take a pill again before a stressful performance. ""It\'s easy enough to find one if I need it,"" she says.\n\nKontorovitch too, was introduced to beta-blockers by a friend. After experiencing its calming effect, she says, she got a prescription.\n\nSome musicians worry that experimenting with beta-blockers could make them dependent on the drugs.\n\nBut Anjan Chatterjee, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, says beta-blockers are usually not addictive. He speculates that ""it\'s the musicians\' psyche that makes them believe that they need it.""\n\nThis is why Curtis violin professor Joseph Silverstein strongly opposes beta-blocker use for anxiety. ""Adrenaline is increased under the strain of performances and we have to deal with it,"" says Silverstein, a former concertmaster for the Boston Symphony Orchestra.\n\nSilverstein has used beta-blockers - after a mild heart attack 13 years ago. ""I had my doctor take me off of them immediately,"" he says, recalling that he had experienced ""dumbed-down moments"" during rehearsals and concerts while on the drugs.\n\n""Students ask about them, and I tell them \'no,\' "" he says. ""I don\'t believe in meddling with your natural biorhythms, which is such an important aspect of our lives as musicians.""\n\nColleague Hal Robinson begs to differ. Though he says he has never used a beta-blocker, the former National Symphony Orchestra bass player believes that ""certain musicians will never play up to their full potential without it.""\n\nMusicians are under lots of pressure to land slots in highly competitive orchestras, Robinson says, and physical responses to stress can hinder some people\'s ability to perform.\n\nKurt Hansen, a faculty member at the Bienen School, says that an exceptionally talented friend of his gave up performing because of her inability to conquer stage fright in 1964, before beta-blockers.\n\n""She would be a complete basket case,"" says the renowned tenor, who says he has never used the drug himself. ""I\'ve always wondered if beta-blockers could have helped her. . . . She had such a beautiful voice.""\n\nWhile some adrenaline can be helpful, too much can be debilitating, Chatterjee says.\n\nBoth Robinson and Hansen believe beta-blockers are worth taking for performance anxiety.\n\n""Many call them \'performance enhancers.\' I call them \'performance enablers,\' "" Robinson says.\n\nHe estimates that close to a third of his students are currently taking beta-blockers - with his ""blessings.""\n\nAs the classical music world becomes ever more competitive, many students are trying to keep up with the Joneses, or in this case the Yo-Yo Mas.\n\n""I think I would have done so much better with my career, if I knew about beta-blockers when I was in school,"" Kontorovitch says.']","An imbalanced story that used lots of anecdotes to paint a picture of benefit without providing readers with solid information about the amount of benefit that may be obtained, side effects of the medications, or alternative methods of treatment.

More than 10 million American adults have osteoporosis, and 80 percent of the people being treated for the condition nationwide are women, according to the Society\'s Endocrine Facts and Figures Report. Women are three times more likely to experience an osteoporosis-related bone fracture in their lifetimes than men.\n\n""Our study is the largest and longest controlled study of growth hormone treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women to date,"" said one of the study\'s authors, Emily Krantz, MD, of Södra Älvsborgs Hospital in Borås, Sweden. ""Years after treatment stopped, women who were treated with growth hormone still experienced improved bone density and reduced fracture risk.""\n\nDuring an 18-month-long randomized, double-blind trial, 80 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis received daily injections of either placebo, a single unit of growth hormone or a 2.5-unit dose of growth hormone. The women were between the ages of 50 and 70 when they were recruited for the decade-long study.\n\nAfter 18 months, the women who received the placebo halted the injections. Women who received growth hormone continued to receive injections for another 18 months. The researchers continued to follow up with the women for seven years after the growth hormone treatment was halted to monitor their bone density, fractures and perception of their quality of life.\n\nThe researchers compared the participants\' bone density and rate of fractures to those of a group of 120 women who did not have osteoporosis. The controls were identified using the city census in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nA decade after the study began, the women who received the larger growth hormone dose still had higher bone mineral density levels than the participants who received the lower dose or the placebo. The rate of fractures in the treated women who had osteoporosis declined by 50 percent during the 10-year-long study. More than half of the participants had fractured bones prior to the start of the study.

Perhaps more important, this was essentially an observational follow-up study to the original trial, and there were a number of factors discussed below in our review that could have confounded or biased the results.

MicroRNAs influence protein activities throughout the body, and they are easily measured in biofluids, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva, according to the authors.\n\nDr. Steve Hicks, senior author of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine, said the ""five microRNAs in saliva could predict with approximately 85% accuracy which concussed children would have symptoms one month later. In comparison, standard survey measures that are typically used in clinics were approximately 65% accurate.""\n\nThe study was funded in part by Quadrant Biosciences, a biotech company that hopes to bring a saliva test for concussion to market in the next 12 to 24 months, Hicks said.\n\nConcussions affect mostly children\n\nIn 2013, there were about 2.8 million traumatic brain injury-related ER visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nJUST WATCHED Concussions keep kids out of school Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Concussions keep kids out of school 01:08\n\nNearly two-thirds of concussions take place in children and teens, Hicks and his co-authors noted. Although most patients\' symptoms disappear within two weeks, one-third of children and teens may experience prolonged symptoms of concussion.\n\n""It\'s frustrating for both parents and physicians that we can\'t accurately and objectively predict how long a child\'s concussion symptoms might last, what those symptoms are likely to consist of and when it might be safe for them to return to sports or school,"" said Hicks, who, as a practicing pediatrician, has routinely cared for kids with concussions.\n\nFor the study, Hicks and his co-authors looked at 52 patients between the ages of 7 and 21, with an average age of 14.\n\nMicroRNA expression was measured in saliva spit into a cup by the patients, who had been injured mostly in sports or car accidents, when they arrived at Penn State Hershey Medical Center for an evaluation. Of the 52, 30 had prolonged symptoms and 22 had short-term symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury.\n\nLevels of five microRNAs accurately identified patients with prolonged symptoms in the study. Even more, the five saliva biomarkers were more accurate than the Standardized Concussion Assessment Tool 3, a questionnaire currently used to help make a diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury. The questionnaire is not a standalone tool but one used in conjunction with an assessment made by a medical professional. It notes that an athlete may have a concussion even if their score is ""normal.""\n\n""We found three microRNAs that were highly associated with specific symptoms one month after injury, such as headache, fatigue and memory difficulties,"" Hicks said. He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers.\n\n""Fortunately, the technology required to measure saliva RNA is already employed in medicine; we use it to check patients for upper respiratory viruses in our hospitals and clinics every day,"" Hicks said. ""Modifying this approach for patients with concussions could potentially provide a rapid, objective tool for managing brain injury.""\n\nThe new research ""represents an advance in the science of sport-related concussions,"" according to an editorial published alongside the study in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\n\'Way too early to know\'\n\nHowever, the editorial authors, Dr. William P. Meehan III of Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention at Boston Children\'s Hospital in Massachusetts and Dr. Rebekah Mannix of Brain Injury Center at Boston Children\'s Hospital, noted that ""the relatively small sample size in this study requires larger-scale studies to determine the reliability"" of the results.\n\nFor example, they noted that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications is common among those with more severe injury. In the study, those who had used anti-inflammatory medications were the ones with longer-term symptoms. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential \'confounding\' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation.\n\nStill, ""the findings are promising, representing potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, recovery, and prognostic assessment of a sport-related concussion.""\n\nDr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that ""work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting.""\n\n""I think the main caveat is, this is way too early to know what this type of tool can do for us,"" added Kutcher, who was not involved in the new research. ""The main reason is that there\'s a difference between simply having a brain that experiences force and being concussed.""\n\nThe saliva biomarker may be showing that neurons experienced force and not that a there is a concussion, with which the brain cannot perform its typical functions within a normal range, he said: ""I would hesitate to assign too much potential groundbreaking science.""\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nOther biomarkers, including blood, are being investigated as potential concussion tests, he said, though ""nothing is at this stage or beyond this.""\n\nThere are also tools that look at the electrical networks that brains form, he said, disclosing that he is consulting for a company working on one such technology. A patient undergoes an electroencephalogram while doing a cognitive task, and the EEG records how the brain responds.\n\n""By actually (measuring) the brain network activity directly, you can look at really what is the functional health of the brain,"" he said.\n\nIn addition, some scientists are exploring functional MRI techniques to look at the metabolic function of different areas of the brain to gain insight into concussion, he said.\n\nHicks said he and his colleagues are collaborating with others to examine saliva biomarkers in adult athletes and members of the armed services.\n\n""Because the markers we identified in this study are not correlated with patient age, we are hopeful they may be applied in adult populations, as well,"" he said.']","However, the story could have provided more information on the potential harms of screening tests, as well as expected costs.","CNN’s story describes a study that identified microRNA markers in the saliva of children and teens who’ve sustained a concussion; five of these biomarkers could be used in an algorithm to predict whether or not the youngsters’ concussions symptoms would subside within four weeks of their injury.

Keeping skin healthy in the bright light of day is hard work. The devotion to hats and rash guards, the careful selection of sunscreen and thorough application and reapplication every 90 minutes is at best tedious, and when children are involved, the process can be truly demoralizing. But once the towels are hung on the line, in the soft light of dusk, your work is done. Right?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nThough women have been pummeled with information on sunscreen and other UV-protection products, few know what they can do to minimize sun damage after they go inside. Christine Lennon and Dr. Darrell Rigal join Tanya Rivero. Photo: Getty\n\nA new school of thought in the beauty world is pushing the idea that what you put on your skin after a day at the beach could play a part in reducing sun damage. One proponent of the concept is Hillary Peterson, founder of Bay Area-based company True Nature Botanicals. Ms. Peterson, a former marketing executive, began to explore the use of all-natural products several years ago after surviving melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer.\n\nHer take on sun exposure is refreshingly pragmatic. “The message with…protection has been to stay out of [the sun],” said Ms. Peterson. “But I’m on the phone with you from Hawaii and can see at least 40 people on the beach, soaking in the rays. My kids are outside playing. I know that it’s not realistic to say ‘no sun.’ ”\n\nShe is, however, quite knowledgeable about how to be safe when you’re in the sun. (She’s also called on Terrence Collins, the Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University as a consultant to formulate her line.) Ms. Peterson has long been aware of the role that antioxidants play in protecting skin from UV damage. (A groundbreaking study in 1996 proved antioxidants like vitamins C and E can boost the efficacy of sunscreen and make skin more resistant to damage.) She even brews antioxidant-rich green tea, lets it cool and puts it in a spray bottle. “I spritz my kids with it before I apply sunscreen and again after they come out of the sun,” she said.\n\nTwilight Treatments // Three Great After-Sun Products Pacific Mist, $48, and Pacific Face Oil, $110, tnbotanicals.com; One Love Organics Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum, $39, pharmaca.com; Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion, $33, blissoma.com Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nNow, a new study by Yale University cancer researchers, published this year, shows that the cell-damaging effects of ultra-violet rays may continue for some time after you seek cover. Ergo, it may be necessary to draw out the day’s protective ministrations into nighttime.\n\nThis information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after-sun care—a category traditionally limited to aloe vera-laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun-parched skin but not much else. Product formulators are now seeing after-sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks.\n\nMs. Peterson recommends her Pacific Mist spray which contains antioxidant-rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract, which aids in hydration, and the line’s Pacific Face Oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed, kiwi, passion fruit and papaya seed—all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants.\n\nWhen shopping for other after-sun treatments, be aware that some labels only add a trace, ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label, while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant.\n\n“ My kids are outside playing. I know that it’s not realistic to say “no sun.” ”\n\nOne Love Organics, a 6-year-old company founded by ex-lawyer Suzanne LeRoux, is a fine example of the latter. Based in St. Simons Island, Ga., the brand has an Eco-Cert-certified lab that creates mostly organic, botanical-based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind. Ms. LeRoux typically recommends layering the brand’s Vitamin C Body Oil or the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum under sunscreen during the day. Rich with botanical oils and green tea extract, both are also ideal after-sun products. “Our lab is on an island in the South. We think about sun exposure a lot,” she added.\n\nAfter-sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air, like Blissoma’s pomegranate extract-filled Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion. Avoid products formulated with alcohol, which can dry skin out.\n\nNot everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after-sun care. Beverly Hills-based dermatologist Rhonda Rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture. “That can make sun-exposed skin feel better,” she said, “But there’s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure.” And while Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, believes that the Yale study was important, he cautions that you only have a three-hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits—and that antioxidants “are notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective.”\n\nBut believers like True Nature Botanicals’ Ms. Peterson are undeterred. “In medicine, you need a definitive study,” she countered. “We can’t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet, your body will function better. But [by] bringing Omega-3 and -6 and antioxidants to the skin, we’re giving it more of the tools it needs to handle sun exposure.”']","A story in the Wall Street Journal’s lifestyle section includes statements about possible health effects of some skin care products, but doesn’t give readers the facts they need.","Drawing on concerns raised earlier this year by a study that found sun damage to skin continues even after exposure to the sun has stopped, this article cites several products that it says may help limit the damage, but it offers scant evidence to support their use.
The article takes a consumer’s guide approach to address the potential impact of post-sun exposure skin care. It is an interesting, under-explored area but the primary evidence is anecdotal from those selling the products they tout as beneficial.

574,story_reviews_00752,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/a-pill-so-people-with-celiac-disease-can-eat-freely/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,A Pill So People With Celiac Disease Can Eat Freely?,"['By Barbara Bronson Gray\n\nHealthDay Reporter\n\nFRIDAY, Feb. 8, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- For people with celiac disease, everyday foods such as bread, pizza crust and muffins are potential enemies. But scientists anticipate that some day a simple pill could help prevent the digestive upsets caused by ingesting the gluten in wheat, rye or barley products.\n\nThe only current treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. A new study, however, offers some potential for hope. Researchers have re-engineered a naturally occurring enzyme, kumamolisin-As, to break down gluten in the stomach into much smaller protein pieces, called peptides. They say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms.\n\nThe re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. It dismantled more than 95 percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease, according to the study, which was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.\n\nIdeally, the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies Beano or Gas-X and offer it without a prescription, said lead study author Justin Siegel, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. But this could take a few years to develop. If the researchers opt to make a prescription drug, the process of clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval could take a decade or more, he said.\n\nAn enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction. Proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing, and their function is defined by their shape and structure.\n\nIn this case, the researchers re-engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment. ""We did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein,"" Siegel said.\n\nThe next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals. ""It shouldn\'t be toxic; it\'s just a protein you\'re eating,"" Siegel said.\n\nHow effective might the enzyme be? ""For some people, even flour in the air makes them stop breathing. Some are very sensitive, and in some it just upsets their stomach a little,"" Siegel said. ""For those who are hypersensitive, this probably is not going to solve the problem, but it would allow them to go to dinner, and in case any gluten ended up in their meal, they wouldn\'t have to worry about it.""\n\n""For those less sensitive, they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want,"" he added.\n\nThe process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease-causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution, Siegel said. ""We can design a small molecule, a pill, that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects, if any,"" he said.\n\nSome experts identified limitations to the research.\n\n""This is the earliest phase, and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human,"" said Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. ""Let\'s see how it goes with a whole slice of bread.""\n\nMurray said that dismantling 95 percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection. ""It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident,"" he said.\n\nBut celiac disease is a common problem, with about 2 million to 3 million Americans suffering from it. ""People need alternatives, and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease,"" Murray said.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about celiac disease from the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']",An incomplete and overly optimistic story about a treatment that hasn’t advanced beyond a test tube.,"This story cedes control to an enthusiastic author of the study being covered, allowing him to speculate optimistically about the benefits of an experimental treatment that is very early in its development. The restraining hand of an outside expert isn’t felt until the very end of the piece, by which time the story has already pumped up the potential benefits far beyond what is warranted.

575,story_reviews_01122,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3835/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,Pushing Limits of New Knees,"['John Jeffries, a 49-year-old money manager in Dover, Mass., had hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008 and is now coaching his son\'s basketball team and long-distance cycling.\n\nAlex Douglas, a Wall Street software architect, had both knees replaced last year at 39 after years of sports injuries. He can\'t wait to go kite-boarding this weekend. ""I\'ve been cleared to have fun,"" he says.\n\nJoint-replacement patients these days are younger and more active than ever before. More than half of all hip-replacement surgeries performed this year are expected to be on people under 65, with the same percentage projected for knee replacements by 2016. The fastest-growing group is patients 46 to 64, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nMany active middle-agers are wearing out their joints with marathons, triathlons, basketball and tennis and suffering osteoarthritis years earlier than previous generations. They\'re also determined to stay active for many more years and not let pain or disability make them sedentary.\n\nTo accommodate them, implant makers are working to build joints with longer-wearing materials, and surgeons are offering more options like partial knee replacements, hip resurfacing and minimally invasive procedures.\n\nMore younger people also need joint-replacement surgery due to obesity, and some orthopedists refer them for weight-loss surgery first to reduce complications later.\n\nEven the most fit patients face a long period of rehabilitation after surgery and may not be able to resume high-impact activities.\n\n""There is, to be honest, some irrational exuberance out there,"" says Daniel Berry, chief of orthopedic surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. ""People may be overly optimistic about what joint replacement can do for them.""\n\nOne big unknown: How long will the replacement joints last? In the past, many doctors assumed implants would wear out in about 10 or 15 years, and they urged young patients to put off surgery as long as possible to minimize the risk of needing a costly and difficult revision surgery—or even two. (A total knee replacement typically costs $15,000 to $22,000. A revision can be $45,000 or more, with a higher risk of complications.)\n\nJohn Jeffries, 49, had his hip resurfaced in 2008. Dominick Reuter for The Wall Street Journal\n\nSteven Haas, chief of the knee service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, says he frequently sees young patients who are in too much pain to play with their kids, take walks, work or enjoy traveling. ""To them, the idea of being miserable in their 50s so they might not need another surgery in their 70s doesn\'t make much sense,"" he says.\n\nSeveral studies of hips and knees implanted in patients long ago have found that 85% to 90% are still functioning well after 20 years. Advances in wear-resistant materials may make implants being used today last even longer.\n\nFor example, many hips and knees use a combination of metal and polyethylene parts, and continuous motion can wear away small polyethylene particles. Scientists have found that irradiating the polyethylene removes free oxygen radicals that contribute to degradation, so the polyethylene components are expected to wear much longer.\n\n""Metal-on-metal"" hip parts were supposed to wear better than plastic, but their use is declining due to concerns that they can release metal ions into patients\' bloodstreams and cause soft-tissue damage. Hip implants made with ""ceramic-on-ceramic"" components have a disconcerting tendency to squeak.\n\nLast year, one manufacturer, Smith & Nephew, won clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market its latest technology as a ""30-year knee"" based on tests mimicking 30 years of wear.\n\nStill, there are no long-term data on how any of the latest implants will fare in actual patients. ""We have to install them and see,"" says Robert Namba, an orthopedic surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in Irvine, Calif.\n\nThe biggest variable is patients themselves. As a rule, the more active they are, the faster their joints will wear out, loosen or require revision.\n\nMost orthopedic surgeons encourage patients with hip and knee implants to walk, swim and cycle as much as possible. Golf and doubles tennis are acceptable. But jogging, running, jumping and singles tennis are out. ""If your goal is a 30-year knee, you need to avoid high-impact sports,"" says John Wright, an orthopedic surgeon at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston.\n\nThat said, some patients are determined to push the envelope, and some doctors give their blessing.\n\n""If you have a brand new sports car and leave it in the garage, it will last forever and you won\'t have any fun,"" says Thomas Schmalzried, an orthopedic surgeon at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles. A former college basketball player, Dr. Schmalzried has patients who play competitive sports and run marathons with artificial joints. ""I know that the technology is capable of this level of athletic function. What I don\'t know—what nobody knows—is where the lines are for the average patient.""\n\nSome doctors compromise and tell patients they can ski and surf if they were good at it before surgery, (and as long as they avoid skiing moguls).\n\n""There\'s a happy medium, and it\'s not necessarily the same for every patient,"" says Dr. Berry. ""One might say, \'I\'m willing to take a risk because that activity is important to me,\' and another might not.""\n\nPersonal quality of life issues are also important in deciding whether—and when—a patient is ready for joint-replacement surgery.\n\n""It got to the point where I couldn\'t get on my motorcycle anymore,"" says Paul Canter, a picture framer from Los Angeles who had a double hip replacement at 63 last year.\n\nChris Schubert was kicked by a horse when she was 25, then suffered a near-fatal staph infection from a cortisone shot. Mounting pain and inflammation over the next 14 years forced her to quit recreational horseback riding, interrupted her sleep and interfered with her work as a building contractor. She had minimally invasive knee replacement surgery with Dr. Haas last year, at age 38, and her pain and limitations are gone. ""I thought my path in life was set and I\'d just be miserable,"" she says. ""I never imagined my life could be this wonderful.""\n\nPatients say that regaining function after surgery requires enormous mental and physical effort. ""Pre-hab""—building up strength before the surgery—is just as important as re-hab afterward, they say.\n\n""I was in the best shape of my life before I went in for the surgery,"" says Mr. Jeffries, the money manager, who trained twice a day for six months before his hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008.\n\nAnd staying as fit and strong as possible is also critical to joint preservation. ""I made up my mind. If I was going to go through all this surgery and rehab, I wanted to make these hips last as long as they possibly can,"" says Carol Espel, 55, an executive of Equinox Fitness who damaged both hips dancing professionally and teaching fitness for years. Now she takes classes in cycling, yoga, Pilates and strength training weekly. ""No impact ever,"" she says.\n\nMark Liszt, the owner of a wholesale meat company in Los Angeles who had double knee replacement surgery in 2008 at the age of 60, says the first five months of rehab were very painful and discouraging. ""You\'re fighting to get range of motion back. You\'re fighting to break adhesions. You\'re fighting depression and you\'re wondering, \'Is an era of your life over?\' "" But he worked through the pain and was back playing basketball a few months later.\n\nNow 63, he still plays basketball twice a week. The surgery, he says, ""gave me my life back. I can pivot. I can do a hook shot. And I am completely pain free.""\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Our 3 reviewers felt that the story attempted balance, but that overall it was overly optimistic about the ability of knee &amp; hip replacement surgery to return middle-agers with painful osteoarthritis to pain-free, athletic lives.</span>","This article looked at this issue through the positive short-term experiences of six individuals who opted for joint replacement in mid-life.
They all seemed to be exuberantly active and have splendid outcomes after emerging from post-operative rehabilitation. The six recipients of artificial knees and hips were collectively able to engage in long-distance cycling, kite-boarding, motorcycling, yoga, pilates, strength training and basketball.
One woman reported that her pain and limitations were completely gone.  “I never imagined my life could be so wonderful,” she commented.
Although several of the subjects were pushing the envelope in terms of stressing their implanted joints with high-impact activities, not a single one reported a problem, a complication, or a functional limitation when they returned to normal activity.
In a country where more than half of adults are overweight, and almost half are completely sedentary, the joint replacement patients in the Wall St. Journal article are far from the norm. It is hard to imagine that these six individuals are representative of patients who opt for joint replacement in middle age across the United States.
The story did attempt to balance the idealized view of joint replacement in the patient vignettes with cautionary notes from several surgeons. These invited experts pointed out that artificial joint recipients should avoid high-impact sports and that the durability of joints implanted in mid-life remains uncertain. Given the views of these experts, some tough questioning of the patients could have shown the reader that these individuals may be experiencing short-term benefits at the expense of long-term misery—if their implants ultimately fail.
More references to scientific studies would have been welcome. The article never reported the overall success rate of knee and hip replacement in younger patients.  Or the degree to which these procedures lead to an increased level of activity. It gave short shrift to one of the key questions about joint replacement in middle-age. In terms of pain, function, and adverse advents, what are the projected outcomes of the revision procedures that appear to be inevitable for surgeries performed at this age?
And the article never got into the thorny question as to whether the surge in knee and hip replacement in younger patients might represent over-utilization of these surgical procedures—or at least premature use.
A recent commentary in Arthritis Care & Research suggested that patients and their doctors in the United States rely excessively on analgesics and joint replacement to treat osteoarthritis of the knee and hip—and are under-utilizing evidence-based treatments, such as weight loss and exercise programs, that might delay these operations. (See Hunter et al., 2011).

Doctors call this a fragility fracture—one that results from a decrease in bone density.\n\nA recent study of about 440 people over 50 years old found women were about three times as likely as men (53% versus 18%) to be tested using a bone-density scan after suffering a distal-radial fracture, or broken wrist, a common warning sign of early osteoporosis. The study, conducted by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, was published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.\n\nBare Bones Osteoporosis, commonly thought of as a women’s disease, also affects many men. Osteoporosis occurs when bone tissue breaks down faster than it is replaced, causing bones to become less dense and more likely to fracture.\n\nA broken bone is often the first sign of osteoporosis. Breakages are most common in the wrist, spine or hip.\n\nAbout half of women over age 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis. As many as one in four men will suffer a breakage.\n\nMen are twice as likely as women to die in the year following a hip fracture.\n\nBone density, which peaks between ages 20 and 30, declines with age and especially in women after menopause. A bone density test, a type of Xray, can diagnose osteoporosis.\n\nThe higher your bone density was at its peak, the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis. Sources: National Osteoporosis Foundati\n\nThe National Bone Health Alliance, a public-private partnership managed by the nonprofit National Osteoporosis Foundation, is nearing completion of a year-long pilot project at three hospitals to test programs called fracture-liaison services that make bone-density tests routine for patients over 50 with fragility fractures.\n\nSuch tests currently are recommended in the treatment guidelines of various medical groups. They also are regularly performed at some U.S. managed-care organizations, including Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and some national health-care systems, such as in the U.K. But experts say the majority of patients in the U.S., especially men, don’t get tested for osteoporosis after suffering a fragility fracture.\n\nOsteoporosis is commonly thought of as a women’s disease, but as many as one in four men in the U.S. over the age of 50 will break a bone as a result of the condition, more than will have prostate cancer, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. By comparison, one out of two women will break a bone from osteoporosis. The disease also is a common cause of hip fractures, and men are twice as likely as women to die in the year after suffering a broken hip, says the Switzerland-based International Osteoporosis Foundation. The IOF made men the focus of World Osteoporosis Day in October and released an in-depth report called “Osteoporosis in Men: Why Change Needs to Happen.”\n\nRobert Spezzano, 54, an assistant principal at an independent high school in Washington, D.C., fell off his bicycle in the fall, breaking his wrist and elbow. After surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, which is participating in the pilot project, he got a call from the hospital’s fracture-liaison-service coordinator suggesting he make an appointment for a bone-density test. “I was real skeptical, got real defensive about the term fragility fracture,” says Mr. Spezzano. “I fell hard, so I wasn’t surprised my arm broke.”\n\nWhen the test results clearly showed osteoporosis, Mr. Spezzano says he was “blown away. My mind was racing. You just think it’s a woman’s disease.” Although his doctor recommended prescription medication, Mr. Spezzano says he plans first to sharply step up his exercise regimen and take vitamin D supplements to see if that helps.\n\nAndrea Singer, leader of the project at MedStar Georgetown, says results of the pilot haven’t yet been compiled, but the number of patients post-fracture who are identified, assessed for osteoporosis and put on treatment if needed is up significantly.\n\nPatients “aren’t necessarily thrilled with the diagnosis, but they’re thrilled that someone is looking at the whole person,” Dr. Singer says.\n\nBone tissue is always breaking down. When it isn’t replaced fast enough, bones become less dense and prone to breakage, even with a relatively minor fall or bump. Tests for osteoporosis include a bone-density scan, a type of X-ray of the hip, wrist or spine, and blood or urine tests to check calcium and vitamin D levels.\n\nBone density declines gradually as people age, and especially for women after menopause. Factors like family history and lifestyle contribute to people’s risk for getting osteoporosis. Some medications, such as corticosteroids or androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, and some underlying medical conditions also can promote the condition.\n\nWhen osteoporosis isn’t too severe or the patient is relatively young, doctors may recommend calcium or vitamin D supplements, diet changes or more weight-bearing exercise, which strengthens bones. People with a greater risk of future fractures may be put on medications called bisphosphonates, which slow bone breakdown and slightly increase bone mass. Bisphosphonates, sold under brand names such as Fosamax and Actonel, are highly effective. But because of some possible, rare side effects—an unusual type of fracture of the thigh bone and a deterioration of the jaw bone—the medication often isn’t prescribed for more than five years.\n\nMany men “think they can’t get osteoporosis. A man will say, ‘Oh, it was a really bad fall’,” says Richard Dell, head of Kaiser Permanente Southern California’s fracture-liaison service until he retired last year. Care managers at Kaiser order a bone-density scan for everyone over 50 whose fracture results from a simple fall. A clinic sees patients who have abnormal scans, does lab tests and prescribes treatment if needed.\n\nSince the service was launched in 1997, the rate of hip fractures at Kaiser is down 40%, says Dr. Dell, an improvement he attributes in large part to the fracture-liaison service. Dr. Dell currently advises the National Osteoporosis Foundation on its effort to get more hospitals to adopt the services.\n\nA key goal of the hospital pilot project, which is funded by Merck & Co., the maker of Fosamax, is to find out if a fracture-liaison service can be effective in a non-managed-care environment. Among other things, the project has been testing systems to keep track of patients who might receive follow-up care from multiple providers. It eventually plans to make the systems available to hospitals launching such services.\n\nAlthough managed-care-hospital networks can save money by reducing hip fractures in their patients, other hospitals stand to forgo $25,000 or more for every hip surgery they don’t perform. Many experts believe fracture-liaison services will be more widely adopted once Medicare, the big government insurer, pegs more of its payments to patients’ overall health outcomes.\n\n“When they put in more pay-for-performance programs, that’s when it will really get attention,” says Douglas Dirschl, chairman of orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation at University of Chicago Medicine, which isn’t participating in the pilot project. Fracture-liaison services represent “the best chance we have” for getting men and women evaluated and treated for osteoporosis, he says.']","A nice distillation of efforts to screen more men for bone density that could have been improved with cost, harm, and quality of evidence information.","This story is so well researched and written that it covers a lot of ground in a short amount of space. It summarizes decades of science related to bone health and left us wanting a closer look at some of the more recent evidence, particularly the study that sets the stage at the top of the story. Without any mention of costs, the potential harms of over-screening, or the quality of the evidence in that study or others, readers may be left with the impression that they should make sure to have a bone density screening at their next available opportunity.

Nothing worked.”\n\nFrustrated with living a life in pain, Jarrett turned to Dr. Halland Chen, a knee specialist in New York City, who offered a new non-surgical treatment known as the iovera system.\n\n""The iovera works in a very novel fashion. It actually harnesses the power of focus cold therapy,” Chen told FoxNews.com.\n\nThe iovera treatment uses a handheld device with nitrous oxide canisters to freeze short needle probes to negative 126 degrees. Once injected into the skin, the cold therapy kills away targeted sensory nerves around the knee-- which prevents the nerve from sending pain signals.\n\n""Within 15 to 25 minutes we\'ve frozen away the nerve and the patient will know immediately if they have good results,"" Chen said.\n\nChen says he typically sees people with arthritis or those who have had total knee replacements and still struggle with residual pain.

And I do so much more--so much more. I go out a lot, I play with my grandkids.

He\'s a professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine, in Durham, N.C.\n\nWhile other research has found that weight-loss surgery is the most effective treatment for obese patients, there is less data on long-lasting effects. The new study is notable because of the decade-long follow-up, said Maciejewski, who is also a research career scientist at Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nIn the two-part study, Maciejewski\'s team first looked at the results of about 1,800 men and women who had gastric bypass surgery. The investigators compared weight changes in gastric bypass surgery patients to weight changes in more than 5,300 obese veterans who had no weight-loss surgery or formal weight-loss treatment.\n\nGastric bypass surgery involves making the stomach smaller, and attaching the lower part of the small intestine directly to the stomach, so much of the small intestine is bypassed. After surgery, people feel much fuller, faster. The surgery also appears to alter gut hormones, gut bacteria and metabolism, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\n\nAt the study\'s one-year mark, those who had the bypass had lost 31 percent of their starting weight, but the non-surgical patients had lost just 1 percent.\n\nAt 10 years, the researchers had weight information on 564 of the nearly 1,800 patients who had the gastric bypass. Only 19 of them had regained so much weight that they were nearly back to their starting weight; the rest kept off the weight.\n\nCompared to the non-surgical group, the bypass group weighed 21 percent less than at the start of the study.\n\nNext, the researchers compared three types of weight-loss surgeries: gastric bypass; sleeve gastrectomy; and adjustable gastric banding. In gastric banding, a band is placed at the top of the stomach to create a small pouch that reduces the size of the stomach. In sleeve gastrectomy, most of the stomach is removed, leaving a banana-shaped sleeve. As with gastric bypass surgery, both of these procedures leave people feeling full faster, according to NIDDK.\n\nAfter four years, those who had gastric bypass lost nearly 28 percent of their starting weight. People who had sleeve gastrectomy lost about 18 percent and those with gastric banding lost about 11 percent, the researchers found.\n\nThe average age of the men and women studied was about 52, and three-quarters were men. Most were white.\n\nThe study was published online Aug. 31 in JAMA Surgery.\n\nThe study helps address a knowledge gap about long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Jon Gould, chief of general surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nThe study ""shows that the gastric bypass procedure compared to sleeve gastrectomy or adjustable gastric banding produces more weight loss and it was sustained over the long term,"" Gould said. He wrote a commentary to accompany the study in the same issue of the journal.\n\nBased on the new study findings, Gould said, ""I think a patient who is young and who has a long way to go may want to think about these results, and all other things being equal, might pick a gastric bypass for the long-term weight loss.""\n\nThe new finding, he added, validates his belief that the gastric bypass could be a ""durable procedure.""\n\nMaciejewski acknowledged that the study has limitations. For example, the study included mostly men, so the findings may not apply to women. In addition, women who undergo bariatric surgery are typically in their 30s through their 50s, he said. In this study, the average age of the men and women was 52.\n\n""These results may not generalize to everyone,"" he said.\n\nAnother possible limitation was the loss of patients during the follow-up, which could have affected the results, the researchers noted.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about bariatric surgery procedures, visit the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.']",This quick story on a new study looking at long-term prospects for keeping weight off after bariatric surgery touched on most key points readers would be curious about.,"Bariatric surgeries have been identified as perhaps the most successful means for people who are morbidly obese to lose weight, and use of these procedures is increasing, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. Information about whether the weight-loss results last, and for how long, is a useful addition to the growing medical literature on these surgeries.
The study described here by HealthDay speaks directly to the issue in a couple of well-designed analyses, and the story does a good job of explaining both the methods and the results. Missing from an otherwise good narrative is information about the risks of these procedures, as well as their costs and overall availability to the general public.

Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while.\n\nIn a Manhattan office building on a recent evening, two dozen women — all in their 30s and 40s — sit in folding chairs, balancing cellphones and glasses of wine. They\'re gathered for a seminar called ""Take Control of Your Fertility.""\n\nDr. Alan Copperman of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York wastes no time laying out this harsh reality: By the time a woman hits her 40s, 90 percent of her eggs are abnormal. The chances of a typical 40-year-old getting pregnant in any given month? Ten percent. Unless, that is, she gets pregnant with her younger eggs — eggs she had frozen years before.\n\nCopperman explains the procedure, introduces someone who has gone through it and takes a flurry of questions.\n\nAfterward, women crowd a counter to set up appointments with Copperman\'s clinic, which offers egg freezing. Sally Montgomery is among the youngest here, and the most upbeat. Her mom had trouble conceiving, so she wants to be proactive.\n\n""I\'m 31, your typical New Yorker,"" she says. ""I\'m single, I\'m bouncing around, and I\'d like the opportunity to have a family, so I just figured, \'Why not?\' I don\'t think it\'s a guarantee, but it\'s a nice insurance policy, and I think it takes some of the pressure off.""\n\nOthers, though, slip out quietly. One 40-year-old says she wishes she\'d learned about egg freezing earlier. Esther Montoro, a 37-year-old photographer, looks a little stunned.\n\n""I think it\'s fantastic,"" she says, ""but I think it\'s so incredibly expensive.""\n\nThe whole process — a week of hormones, plus the procedure to collect the eggs — runs $12,000 to $14,000. And because it takes 10 to 20 eggs for a reasonable shot at success, some may need to do this several times. Plus, there are annual storage fees. Then, when you\'re ready to use your eggs, you\'ll need in vitro fertilization, another pricey procedure. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn\'t have.\n\nRead More iStockphoto.com\n\n""I guess there\'s a big assumption that most women that need to do this [are] career, successful, rich women,"" she says. ""And I\'m not!""\n\nTechnological Advances\n\nIn his office later, Copperman empathizes and says he hopes the procedure eventually becomes easier and cheaper. Still, he says, freezing eggs offers many women the biggest game changer since the birth control pill 50 years ago.\n\n""Women began to have reproductive choices,"" he says. ""They got to decide when not to get pregnant. This technology has the potential to help women decide when they can get pregnant.""\n\nClinics in the U.S. have long frozen fertilized eggs, or embryos. But eggs alone are more delicate and prone to damage. Over the years, egg freezing has been offered mainly to cancer patients facing radiation, but success rates were pretty dismal. Of late, though, the technology has exploded thanks to scientific leaps, including a flash-freeze method called vitrification.\n\nIn Copperman\'s lab, you can hear the sizzle as a tiny tube is plunged into liquid nitrogen.\n\n""Snap freeze, snap thaw,"" he says. ""And what\'s really impressive is that when it comes out, it comes out looking just like it went in.""\n\nIronically, much of this research was pioneered in Italy and Spain, where Catholic influence discouraged the creation of too many embryos, leaving fertility researchers with unused eggs instead.\n\nWith the better survival rate from vitrification and other new freezing methods, more and more clinics are now offering what they call ""fertility preservation."" Meanwhile, the early adopters are starting to come back and use their eggs.\n\nFirst Wave Of Babies\n\nIn a New York high rise, 8-month-old Camden squeals in delight as she bounces in her walker. She\'s here thanks to eggs her mom froze several years ago.\n\n""My best friend and I made a pact together that at age 38, if we were both still single, we were going to have a child on our own,"" says Robyn Ross.\n\nWhen that time came, Ross decided she wasn\'t ready for single motherhood. Instead, she froze 14 eggs. Within a year, she fell in love and soon got married.\n\nHer husband, Mark Cohen, says he wasn\'t at all put off by the fact that his new love had her eggs in the freezer. As it turned out, his sperm was weakened by earlier cancer treatment, so conceiving their baby in a lab was the perfect solution.\n\n""And this is our miracle baby,"" Cohen says, planting a kiss on Camden. ""We are one little happy family.""\n\nRoss has already evangelized to her younger sister.\n\n""I made her promise me that if she\'s still single by the age of 32, she would freeze her eggs,"" she says. ""The younger the better.""\n\nNow, before you run out to a fertility clinic, there is a big note of caution. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, which sets industry guidelines, still considers egg freezing experimental.\n\n""If the question were just, \'Does egg freezing and thawing work to achieve a pregnancy?\' I think we\'re close,"" says Dr. Eric Widra, a member of the society\'s executive council.\n\nBut only 1,000 to 2,000 babies in the world have been born using frozen eggs. So far, they\'re fine — no abnormalities. Still, Widra would like a larger-scale, longer-term track record. It\'s not clear when — or if — a big-scale study might happen. But Widra says women need to understand that success rates will never be 100 percent.\n\n""It\'s an insurance policy that you may or may not actually ever need,"" he says. ""And it\'s an insurance policy that if you do need, may not pay out.""\n\nAnd yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. At Shady Grove Fertility, the Washington, D.C., clinic where he practices, he offers it to his own patients.\n\nThe Challenge Of Setting An Age Limit\n\nIt\'s quite a concept: Put your eggs in deep freeze and disconnect from that nagging biological clock. But, until when? How old is too old to use your younger eggs?\n\n""There should be guidelines, I think, that are more clearly defined,"" says Dr. Geoffrey Sher, who heads the Sher Institutes for Reproductive Medicine and is based in Las Vegas.\n\nHe says many clinics suggest a cutoff of 50, the average age of menopause. After that, pregnancy can be riskier, and the large age gap raises complicated social issues. But the limit is tricky to impose. Sher remembers one couple who wanted to use donor eggs to conceive. The husband was 45, his wife, 55. Sher hesitated.\n\n""And she said, \'That\'s discriminatory. If my husband was my age and I was his age, you wouldn\'t hesitate.\' And she had a point,"" Sher says.\n\nThe woman was healthy. And the uterus doesn\'t decline like eggs do; in some cases, it can actually be coaxed back into working order. Sher\'s ethics board said OK.\n\n""And she went ahead and had a baby at 57 years of age without any problems whatsoever,"" Sher says. ""I get a postcard from them at Christmas every year.""\n\nThe bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women — getting them to take action before it\'s too late. They envision a time when society considers freezing eggs an act not of desperation but of empowerment.\n\nThis story was produced for broadcast by Marisa Penaloza.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">In an era calling for comparative effectiveness research, this story never provides comparative data – something we’re quite sure consumers would want in order to evaluate the approaches in question. </span>","This is an interesting story.  But our three reviewers thought it fell short in evaluating the quality of the evidence, in not providing a full description of potential harms, and in framing the issue in a way that smacks of disease-mongering.

That craving is caused by smoking tobacco but is now being increasingly satisfied by e-cigarettes and the trend to ""vape"" instead of smoke.\n\nThe selling point is the clean image e-cigarettes purvey by removing the simultaneous exposure to the tar and thousands of chemicals found in the tobacco smoke of regular cigarettes -- removing the cause of lung diseases as well as other tobacco-related conditions.\n\nTobacco kills almost 6 million people each year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and a growing number of people are now ""vaping"" instead of smoking, resulting in industry worth $2.7 billion worldwide.\n\nSince their introduction in 2006, e-cigarettes have become commonplace among smokers trying to kick their habit, with a third of smokers trying to quit in the United Kingdom turning to e-cigarettes to aid them, according to one study . But some critics argue these electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are fueling a new addiction to nicotine -- particularly among young people experimenting with them.\n\nAllure for adolescents\n\n""While ENDS may have the potential to benefit established adult smokers ... [they] should not be used by youth and adult non-tobacco users because of the harmful effects of nicotine and other risk exposures,"" says Tim McAfee, director the Office on Smoking and Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Exposure to nicotine can harm adolescent brain development.""\n\nStudies conducted by the CDC through its Adult and Youth National Tobacco Surveys found increased experimentation by youth trying out e-cigarettes but not conventional cigarettes. The gadgetry and flavors associated with the devices is suggested as a reason behind this, with fears of them acting as a gateway into real tobacco smoking.\n\nBenan Barwick/CNN Benan Barwick/CNN\n\nBut others in the field of tobacco control disagree, stating that whilst people -- including youth -- may have tried e-cigarettes, the evidence is lacking for their regular use. ""Kids like new technology and just experiment or use it once or twice,"" says Jean-Francois Etter, professor of Public Health at the University of Geneva.\n\nEtter has been researching the use of e-cigarettes since 2009 and believes they are much safer than conventional cigarettes. ""The most dangerous way of consuming nicotine is to smoke it,"" he says. Etter argued this point last week at the World Conference of Tobacco or Health in Abu Dhabi.\n\nWhilst Etter says that use among young people should be monitored, he believes the role of e-cigarettes in reducing global tobacco consumption is more important. ""They are a gateway out of smoking,"" says Etter. The number of people using a combination of tobacco and e-cigarettes is on the rise, according to Etter, resulting in smokers switching and consuming less tobacco each day. ""[They have] the same level of nicotine but people are less exposed to toxins ... nicotine is not a health problem,"" he says. However, further evidence on the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes or nicotine is needed.\n\nSatisfying the craving\n\nNicotine is the main substance keeping people addicted to smoking tobacco and consequently exposing them to the tar and toxins found in cigarettes. Whilst many people try to kick the habit cold turkey, nicotine replacement through gums and patches has long been advocated as a helping hand. ""Nicotine withdrawal is a very unpleasant process,"" says Linda Bauld, professor of Health Policy at the University of Stirling, whose recent report for Public Health England identified an extensive and growing market for e-cigarettes worldwide.\n\n""The vast number of people using e-cigarettes are using them to stop smoking; [they\'re] about 60% more effective than going cold turkey or buying nicotine replacement therapy over the counter.""\n\nBauld\'s research hasn\'t identified a dependence on nicotine with e-cigarettes in the same way as the addiction resulting from regular cigarettes. ""E-cigarettes are not the best nicotine delivery devices,"" she says referring to the fact nicotine is not seen to enter the bloodstream as readily when using e-cigarettes. That\'s backed up by Etter\'s research as well as a recent study by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine, in which e-cigarettes were found to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes.\n\nBenan Barwick/CNN Benan Barwick/CNN\n\nThey do, however, provide nicotine more effectively than aids such as patches or gums, according to Bauld.\n\n""Patches and gums are a very small market,"" says Etter about the quitting devices which first came onto the market 40 years ago. He fears too much restriction on e-cigarettes will limit their impact in achieving a world free of tobacco.\n\nBoth Bauld and Etter recognize the need to monitor the consumption of nicotine among teenagers but feel the value of e-cigarettes among adult smokers and their potential to save lives by reducing tobacco consumption should not be underestimated -- a sentiment recognized by the World Health Organization.\n\n""[E-cigarettes] could be a way to help people quit but we need more evidence and regulation,"" says Armand Peruga, program manager for the WHO\'s Tobacco Free Initiative , which has celebrated 10 years of its Framework for Tobacco Control whilst at the conference in Abu Dhabi.\n\nLegislate and regulate\n\nThe greatest impact to date in reducing the number of smokers worldwide has been the taxation and legislation restricting tobacco advertising and increasing prices. ""For every 10% increase in tax you have 4% reduction in tobacco consumption,"" says Peruga.\n\nThe growing fear is the increasing domination of big tobacco in the e-cigarette market, which was once seen as a competitor. Their ownerships of popular e-cigarette brands could push out smaller companies in the field, reminiscent of the original tobacco epidemic.\n\n""The intent of big tobacco is to sell their product,"" concludes Peruga. ""[They may] expand their market to other customers who didn\'t use cigarettes but might consider nicotine use.""\n\nBut as it seems e-cigarettes are here to stay, most calls are for informed regulation rather than prohibition. ""The majority of e-cigarettes -- especially when they are well regulated -- are likely to be less toxic than cigarettes -- and that for smokers is an advantage,"" says Peruga.']","While this story about e-cigarettes checks most of our boxes, its 4-star score conceals some significant gaps in the coverage. Read the complete review for details.","This story summarizes arguments on the benefits and harms of e-cigarettes, also called “electronic nicotine delivery systems” or ENDS, as gleaned from a recent conference in Abu Dhabi.

What we need to do now is to look at a larger study, to confirm that these initial results are valid,” she added.']",This story leaves out too much information on such a controversial topic.,"The scientists involved in this hormone study claim to have “robust evidence” of benefits for women’s sex lives but then also caution that the sample size is too small to be certain. We wish the story had taken a little more time to help readers decide what to believe and that it had included, in particular, information about costs and conflicts of interest. This is especially important given one of the researcher’s past histories with working closely with pharmaceutical companies to help them promote their products.

Wensman, director of clinical and technical services at the Orthotics and Prosthetics Center at the University of Michigan, is that patients feel better.\n\n“The vast majority of our patients are happier having them than not,” he said about orthotics that are inserted in shoes.\n\nSeamus Kennedy, president and co-owner of Hersco Ortho Labs in New York, said there was an abundance of evidence — hundreds of published papers — that orthotics can treat and prevent “mechanically induced foot problems,” leading to common injuries like knee pain, shinsplints and pain along the bottom of the foot.\n\n“Orthotics do work,” Mr. Kennedy said. “But choosing the right one requires a great deal of care.”\n\nYet Scott D. Cummings, president of the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists, says the trade is only now moving toward becoming a science. So far, most of the focus in that direction has been on rigorously assessing orthotics and prosthetics for other conditions, like scoliosis, with less work on shoe orthotics for otherwise healthy athletes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Anecdotally, we know what designs work and what designs don’t work” for foot orthotics, said Mr. Cummings, who is an orthotist and prosthetist at Next Step in Manchester, N.H. But when it comes to science and rigorous studies, he added, “comparatively, there isn’t a whole lot of evidence out there.”\n\nDr. Nigg would agree.\n\nIn his studies, he found there was no way to predict the effect of a given orthotic. Consider, for example, an insert that pushes the foot away from a pronated position, or rotated excessively outward. You might think it would have the same effect on everyone who pronates, but it does not.\n\nOne person might respond by increasing the stress on the outside of the foot, another on the inside. Another might not respond at all, unconsciously correcting the orthotic’s correction.\n\n“That’s the first problem we have,” Dr. Nigg said. “If you do something to a shoe, different people will react differently.”\n\nThe next problem is that there may be little agreement among orthotics makers about what sort of insert to prescribe.\n\nIn one study discussed in his new book, “Biomechanics of Sport Shoes,” Dr. Nigg sent a talented distance runner to five certified orthotics makers. Each made a different type of insert to “correct” his pronation.\n\nThe athlete wore each set of orthotics for three days and then ran 10 kilometers, about 6 miles. He liked two of the orthotics and ran faster with them than with the other three. But the construction of the two he liked was completely different.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThen what, Dr. Nigg asked in series of studies, do orthotics actually do?\n\nThey turn out to have little effect on kinematics — the actual movement of the skeleton during a run. But they can have large effects on muscles and joints, often making muscles work as much as 50 percent harder for the same movement and increasing stress on joints by a similar amount.\n\nAs for “corrective” orthotics, he says, they do not correct so much as lead to a reduction in muscle strength.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn one recent review of published papers, Dr. Nigg and his colleagues analyzed studies on orthotics and injury prevention. Nearly all published studies, they report, lacked scientific rigor. For example, they did not include groups that, for comparison, did not receive orthotics. Or they discounted people who dropped out of the study, even though dropouts are often those who are not benefiting from a treatment.\n\nBeing generous about studies with design flaws that could overstate effects, Dr. Nigg and his colleagues concluded that custom-made orthotics could help prevent and treat plantar fasciitis, a common injury to a tendon at the bottom of the foot, and stress fractures of the tibia, along the shin. They added, though, that the research was inadequate for them to have confidence in those conclusions.\n\nDr. Nigg also did his own study with 240 Canadian soldiers. Half of them got inserts and the others, for comparison, did not.\n\nThose who got inserts had a choice of six different types that did different things to foot positioning. Each man chose the insert he found most comfortable and wore it for four months. The men selected five of the six inserts with equal frequency.\n\nThe findings were somewhat puzzling: While the group that used inserts had about half as many injuries — defined as pain that kept them from exercising for at least half a day — there was no obvious relation between the insert a soldier chose and his biomechanics without it.\n\nThat’s why Dr. Nigg says for now it is difficult to figure out which orthotic will help an individual. The only indication seems to be that a comfortable orthotic might be better than none at all, at least for the activities of people in the military.\n\nSo where does this leave people like Jason Stallman, my friend and colleague at The New York Times? Jason has perfectly flat feet — no arch. He got his first pair of orthotics at 12 or 13 and has worn orthotics all the time, for walking and running ever since. About a year ago he decided to try going without them in his everyday life; he still wears them when he runs.\n\nEvery medical specialist Jason has seen tried to correct his flat feet, but with little agreement on how to do it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEvery new podiatrist or orthopedist, he told me, would invariably look at his orthotics and say: “Oh, these aren’t any good. The lab I use makes much better ones. Your injury is probably linked to these poor-fitting orthotics.”\n\nSo he tried different orthotic styles, different materials, different orthotics labs with every new doctor.\n\nThat is a typical story, Dr. Nigg says. In fact, he adds, there is no need to “correct” a flat foot. All Jason needs to do is strengthen his foot and ankle muscles and then try running without orthotics.\n\nDr. Nigg says he always wondered what was wrong with having flat feet. Arches, he explains, are an evolutionary remnant, needed by primates that gripped trees with their feet.\n\n“Since we don’t do that anymore, we don’t really need an arch,” he wrote in an e-mail. “Why would we? For landing — no need. For the stance phase — no need. For the takeoff phase — no need. Thus a flat foot is not something that is bad per se.”\n\nSo why shouldn’t Jason — or anyone, for that matter — just go to a store and buy whatever shoe feels good, without worrying about “correcting” a perceived biomechanical defect?\n\n“That is exactly what you should do,” Dr. Nigg replied.""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This article tackled an impossibly broad question and ended up with a vague and murky answer. It tried to take on an important topic, but in seeking broad generalizations, didn’t provide the reader with much useful information.</span>","The question posed in the article is basically the following:  “Are shoe inserts (foot orthotics) effective in the prevention and treatment of injuries among athletes?”’

Why is this impossibly broad? This question encompasses dozens of musculoskeletal, neurologic, and degenerative conditions involving scores of scientific studies. It would have been better for the article to define its scope more narrowly—e.g., foot injuries, lower limb injuries, or low back pain— and look at the evidence more carefully.
Gazing through the prism of a single scientist’s work, the article presents an interesting narrative about the difficulties of performing biomechanical and clinical research in this area. And it endorses a skeptical attitude in interpreting the claims of proponents in this multi-billion dollar industry.
However, the answer to the main question is fundamentally unsatisfying—and “soft” from an evidence perspective: “Shoe inserts may be helpful as a short-term solution, preventing injuries in some athletes,” according to the New York Times.
This is a soft statement because almost any prevention method or treatment will help somebody over the short-term some of the time.  And this permissive conclusion will certainly not deter athletes from seeking out orthotics for dozens of conditions on the premise that they might work.
However, this broad-brush conclusion doesn’t adequately characterize the evidence regarding shoe inserts. That evidence cleaves a little more neatly than this article implies.
By conventional medical standards (well-designed clinical trials) there is no conclusive evidence that shoe inserts are effective in the prevention and treatment of the majority of athletic injuries.
There are a few conditions for which there is preliminary evidence that shoe inserts may offer modest preventive or therapeutic benefits.
But importantly, and never mentioned in this article, there are also conditions in which the effectiveness of shoe inserts has been tested and disproven.
There is credible evidence, for example, that shoe inserts do not prevent low back pain.  If scientists are going to go to the trouble of performing demanding research, it is important that journalists report those results. (See Sahar et al., 2009).

Zap It,"['A growing number of doctors are offering an expensive laser procedure they say zaps away a common fungus that causes ugly, discolored nails. Published data on laser treatment for nail fungus is scant, but early results suggest it is a reasonable option for people who don\'t want the side effects of oral medications.\n\nOnychomycosis, or fungal infection of nails—most often on the toes—affects about 12% of Americans, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Some people are genetically prone to it. Others, including swimmers and other athletes, may be more likely to get it because they go barefoot in public areas or because their feet are often damp, scientists say. In its mild forms, nail fungus is merely a cosmetic problem, but over time it can cause toenails to grow abnormally and become painful when walking.\n\nToenail laser treatment offers a new alternative to oral medication, which carries a risk of liver damage, and a nail lacquer, which has poor efficacy.\n\nThe cost of zapping nail fungus with a laser can range $750 to $1,500 for a treatment course. It isn\'t generally covered by insurance. Whether you choose oral medications or lasers, it can easily take a year for nails to clear entirely.\n\nSo far only one company\'s laser has received Food and Drug Administration clearance, which is a streamlined review process for medical devices, for toenail fungus: PinPointe USA Inc., of Chico, Calif., received clearance in October to market its laser for ""the temporary increase of clear nail"" in patients, according to the FDA clearance letter. Two companies, Nomir Medical Technologies Inc. of Brooklyn, N.Y., which first applied in 2009, and CoolTouch Inc., of Roseville, Calif., have applied for FDA clearance for the nail-fungus purpose and are waiting for an FDA decision.\n\nSeveral other lasers, cleared by the FDA for other purposes, are being used ""off label"" by doctors to treat toenail fungus.\n\nSolid evidence of the lasers\' effectiveness, is scant. In clinical practice, results have varied, according to doctors who have used the laser. New Jersey podiatrist Anas Khoury, who has no affiliation with any laser company, says he has been using Nomir\'s Noveon laser for toenails for about four months and says it works in about 80% of his patients. ""My patients and I are very happy with it,"" he adds.\n\nPhiladelphia podiatrist Warren Joseph, who is a consultant for Nomir and a former consultant for PinPointe, says: ""I think it is a really interesting, viable alternative but I want to see published data."" His advice to patients: ""Ask for the evidence—and not just before-and-after pictures.""\n\nTreatments typically take 30 to 45 minutes for up to 10 toes. Depending on the severity of the problem and the laser used, patients may need one to four treatments.\n\nHow the lasers work varies and how they affect toenail fungus isn\'t fully understood in all cases. Nomir says its lab research shows its laser kills fungus. CoolTouch says it believes its laser inhibits fungal growth, paving the way for the body\'s own defenses to clear the nail.\n\nSo far only Nomir has published evidence of efficacy, but its study is small and short term. A company-funded study of 34 patients and 26 treated toes published last year in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association found that after four laser treatments, 85% of the nails showed new growth without fungus. Of the total, 65% showed at least three millimeters of clear new nail and 26% had at least four millimeters. The study took its final measures six months after treatment, but hasn\'t yet published the data.\n\nPinPointe supplied The Wall Street Journal a summary of unpublished data from a study looking at 265 patients over two years. In the summary, 71.4% of the patients experienced continuous improvement over a year after a single session with its laser.\n\nIf you are willing to risk side effects, the best tested—and likely most effective—treatment for toenail fungus remains oral medications such as Novartis AG\'s Lamisil, says Bryan C. Markinson, chief of podiatric medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Dr. Markinson has been a paid adviser to Novartis and owns stock in Nomir and serves on its medical-advisory board.\n\nAccording to Lamisil\'s FDA-approved prescribing information, 3.3% of patients in clinical trials had abnormal levels of liver enzymes, a possible warning sign of liver damage, compared with 1.4% of people taking a placebo. In rare cases, people have needed liver transplants or died from liver failure after taking Lamisil.\n\nTo prevent fungus recurrence, you must follow a scrupulous hygiene program, including anti-fungal spray for feet and shoes, not going barefoot, keeping feet clean and dry and changing socks daily, doctors say.\n\n""Patients and some doctors have this expectation that because it\'s a laser treatment, once you zap it and its gone forever,"" says Dr. Markinson. ""That totally ignores the fact that this is an infectious disease and that recurrence is a certainty"" unless good prevention measures are taken.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com\n\nWrite to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Any American who hasn’t seen an ad for a local toenail fungus laser treatment center probably has other fungal issues of greater concern after living under a rock.

Detailed results were unveiled on Monday at an American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago and in the Lancet medical journal.\n\nThe result was primarily driven by the difference in deaths of 13.7 percent in the placebo group, or 7 deaths, compared with 3.4 percent, or 2 deaths, for the ixmyelocel-T group. In addition, 38 percent of stem cell patients required hospitalization, versus 47 percent for placebo.\n\n“This is strong evidence in a well-designed trial that we can decrease events,” said Dr. Timothy Henry, the study’s lead investigator and chief of cardiology at Cedars Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles. “For patients, this is a really hopeful thing.”\n\nHenry, who presented the data at the ACC meeting, stressed the need for larger trials to prove the benefit of ixmyelocel-T\n\nFor the treatment, bone marrow is taken from the patient and enhanced over two weeks to increase two types of cells associated with healing. They are then injected directly into the patient’s heart.\n\nWith advanced heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalizations, blood-pumping ability is diminished as the heart’s left ventricle becomes enlarged and weakened.\n\nIf the disease worsens despite all available medicinal and interventional therapies, the only options are heart transplant or a pumping assist device.\n\n“The idea is to find a treatment for this group of people before they get to that stage,” Henry said.\n\nVericel shares were down $2.01, or 33 percent, at $4.02 on Nasdaq.']","Privately funded studies on stem cell therapies are a hot topic, and prone to misleading coverage. This story avoids the biohype, though it would have been stronger if it had independent sources.","
This investor-minded story looks at a Vericel-funded study on the potential benefits of a new stem cell therapy for advanced heart failure patients. Even though its audience was financial folks, the story included a lot of key details that a general story should have, such as the quantified benefits of both primary (i.e, number of deaths) and secondary endpoints (6-minute distance walk test). The story would have been stronger if it had interviewed an independent source other than a financial analyst who could explain the limitations of this trial.

The app was developed by researches from the Wisconsin Institute of Surgical Outcomes Research (WiSOR), Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, with the goal of earlier detection of surgical site infections (SSIs) and prevention of hospital readmissions. The study results appear as an ""article in press"" on the website of the Journal of the American College of Surgeons ahead of print.\n\nSSIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the leading cause of hospital readmission following an operation.1,2,3 Due to the prevalence off SSIs, the WiSOR research team decided to see if postoperative wound monitoring could be effectively achieved by having patients upload photos through the WoundCare app and answer a few brief questions to gather information not easily captured through images.\n\n""Patients cannot identify [infections] and frequently ignore or fail to recognize the early signs of cellulitis or other wound complications,"" study authors wrote. ""This drawback leads to the common and frustrating scenario where patients present to a routine, scheduled clinic appointment with an advanced wound complication that requires readmission, with or without reoperation. However, the complication may have been amenable to outpatient management if detected earlier.""\n\nForty vascular surgery patients were enrolled in the study. There was an overall data submission rate of 90.2 percent among participants, and submissions were reviewed within an average of 9.7 hours. During the study, seven wound complications were detected and one false negative was found.\n\n""We set out to come up with a protocol where patients could become active participants in their care and allow us to be in closer communication and monitor their wounds after they leave the hospital,"" said lead study author and general surgery resident Rebecca L. Gunter, MD. . ""This approach allows us to intervene at an earlier time rather than waiting for patients to come back in after the problem has already developed past the point of being able to manage it on an outpatient basis.""\n\nPatients were enthusiastic about the app\'s ease of use and the reassurance they felt having their wounds regularly monitored. The nurse practitioners responsible for reviewing the submitted images attested to the value of the photos and patient satisfaction, although they also noted it was difficult to find time to review the submitted images on top of an already heavy clinical workload. Study authors note that the success and sustainability of a post-discharge wound-monitoring protocol requires a dedicated transitional care program and not simply adding a task to the current staff workload.\n\nThis protocol also has a cost-savings component, in addition to the patient safety and satisfaction aspects. Study authors note that SSIs are the most expensive hospital-acquired infection, costing an average of nearly $30,000 per wound-related readmission and an estimated $3-10 billion annually.\n\n""If you could imagine saving the cost from the number of patients whose readmission you were able to prevent, that result could provide significant savings to the health system,"" Dr. Gunter said. Although capturing specific numbers related to cost-savings was not part of this study, Dr. Gunter said it is an important area of focus for future studies.\n\nA limitation to telemedicine protocols that call for the use of smartphones is that not every patient has the necessary technology or knowledge to upload images on their own. The WiSOR research team addressed this issue by having participants undergo tailored training to learn to use the WoundCheck app. They provided each patient with an iPhone 5S and an accompanying visual reference guide to further assist in using the phone and app. Dr. Gunter said they were very successful in giving patients knowledge and access to technology so they could participate in the study. She said this is a model easily adaptable to other medical centers, whether through providing participants with a phone, having a rotating supply of phones at the hospitals for patients to borrow, or relying on a patient\'s personal device.\n\n""We have demonstrated that a population of complex and high-risk patients, many of whom are older adults and novice smartphone users, can complete this protocol with high fidelity and satisfaction,"" the researchers concluded.\n\n###\n\nStudy coauthors from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, include Sara Fernandes-Taylor, PhD, Shahrose Rahman, BS, Lola Awoyinka, MPH, Kyla M.

But the procedure had never been done in people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Todd Mainprize, a neurosurgeon at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the University of Toronto, announced at a news conference that he had successfully breached the blood-brain barrier in a 56-year-old Canadian woman whose brain tumor, diagnosed six years ago, had recently begun to grow.\n\nMainprize performed the two-and-a-half-hour procedure last Thursday, with the patient, Bonny Hall, inside an MRI scanner. Hall felt nothing from the seconds-long bursts from 1,024 ultrasound beams aimed at different points around her skull, and an MRI scan confirmed that the brain barrier was successfully traversed.\n\nThe microscopic bubbles — roughly the size of red blood cells — had previously been injected into a vein, along with a chemotherapy drug called liposomal doxorubicin and a tracing molecule.\n\nOn Friday, as scheduled, Hall had brain surgery to remove her tumor. No damage from the ultrasound was visible inside her brain, Mainprize said, and she is recovering well from the surgery.\n\nBecause the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain, the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery, Mainprize said. In the trial at Sunnybrook — funded by the Virginia-based Focused Ultrasound Foundation — nine others are slated to receive the same procedure.\n\nCanadian doctors have successfully breached the blood-brain barrier to deliver chemotherapy to Bonny Hall, whose brain tumor had recently begun to grow. Sunnybrook/Doug Nicholson/Media Source\n\nSucceeding in getting drugs across the barrier is “a huge achievement” said Dr. Nathan McDannold, a radiologist at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who has been working to open the barrier with ultrasound since he first accomplished the feat 15 years ago in animals.\n\nBut it’s just one of many. New, safe doses of drugs will need to be determined, once medication is not being diverted by the blood-brain barrier, noted Dr. Gordon Li, a neurosurgeon at Stanford. “If we feel like we have a safe method of getting drugs in there,” he said, “it will open up a whole new slew of clinical trials.”\n\nMainprize said the patient, a “remarkable woman,” was chosen to go first, because of the status and large size of her tumor, because it was an area of the brain that the ultrasound machinery could easily reach, and because of her willingness to help the research.\n\nIn a prepared video, Hall said she just wants to get back to living her life. “I want to be a normal housewife … a normal grandma.”']",This story gets a little too wrapped up in the enthusiasm surrounding a potential new medical advance that was presented at a news conference. It leaves out key context and includes nobody who casts a skeptical eye on these preliminary findings that haven’t been vetted by the scientific community.,"The story from STAT, an affiliate of Boston Globe Media, reports on the first patient to have a drug delivered into her brain facilitated by ultrasound waves, which work to open up the blood brain barrier. The procedure was carried out only to evaluate safety, with no therapeutic goal for the patient involved. A brain cancer patient, she had her tumor removed after the ultrasound procedure.
This is interesting science and the story does a great job of explaining what happened in this innovative procedure and why it’s potentially important. But our review raises a number of questions about the way the story was reported and whether it could have been more balanced. Costs aren’t mentioned and potential harms are glossed over. And despite the fact that many experts are quoted, there is no one to offer a restraining hand against the story’s overt enthusiasm. This was, after all, only a single patient whose results were presented at a news conference and haven’t been published or peer reviewed.
Bottom line: It’s far from clear that this technique will ever be used clinically, and the story doesn’t do enough to underscore how preliminary the findings are and how much work remains to be done.

Fennell, professor and consultant in thoracic medical oncology at the University of Leicester, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek the study presents an “exciting result.”\n\nHe was particularly surprised by the magnitude of the response triggered by vistusertib combined with paclitaxel, which is closely related to standard chemotherapy.\n\nHowever, Fennell said the study tripped up in that there was no predictive link between mutations and response to treatment. “In other words, there was no sign of who might benefit the most with treatment,"" he explained.\n\nHe continued: “This combination of vistusertib and paclitaxel appears promising in lung cancer. Confirmatory studies will be essential and if positive would broaden our armamentarium for fighting this cancer.”']","While targeted therapies are an important area of research, the public shouldn’t be oversold on early-phase trials or led to think that tumor shrinkage portends a cure.","This story reported on a phase 1b trial of a drug called vistusertib, which is being tested in tandem with chemotherapy on ovarian and lung cancer patients whose disease had been unresponsive to other treatments. The purpose of the trial was to establish dosing and get a preliminary look at the drug’s effectiveness. Findings were published in the Annals of Oncology.
Echoing the optimistic framing of a news release, this Newsweek story focused on the fact that some patients who took their drug saw their tumors shrink, including a quote calling the findings “very encouraging.” It also overlooked discussion of potential harms and and didn’t caution readers that tumor shrinkage doesn’t necessarily lead to longer survival.

650,story_reviews_01387,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3192/,2010-09-27 04:00:00,Simplifying the Decision for a Prostate Screening,"['Stuart Bradford\n\nOne of the most difficult decisions a man makes about prostate cancer happens long before the diagnosis. Should he get a regular blood test to screen for the disease?\n\nScreening for early detection of cancer sounds like a no-brainer, but it’s not an easy choice for men considering regular P.S.A. tests, which measure blood levels of prostate-specific antigen and are used to detect prostate cancer. Though use of the test is widespread, studies show that the screening saves few, if any, lives.\n\nWhile the test helps find cellular changes in the prostate that meet the technical definition of cancer, they often are so slow-growing that if left alone they will never cause harm. But once cancer is detected, many men, frightened by the diagnosis, opt for aggressive surgical and radiation treatments that do far more damage than their cancers would have, leaving many impotent and incontinent.\n\nAs a result, major health groups don’t advise men one way or the other on regular P.S.A. screenings, saying it should be a choice discussed between a man and his doctor.\n\nSo how does a man decide whether to get P.S.A. screening or not? Finally, some new research offers simple, practical advice — at least for men 60 and older.\n\nResearchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Lund University in Sweden have found that a man’s P.S.A. score at the age of 60 can strongly predict his lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer, according to a new report in the British medical journal BMJ.\n\nThe findings also suggest that at least half of men who are now screened after age 60 don’t need to be, the study authors said.\n\nThe researchers followed 1,167 Swedish men from the time they were 60 years old until they died or reached 85. During that time, there were 43 cases of advanced prostate cancer and 35 deaths in the group. The researchers found that having had a P.S.A. score of 2.0 or higher at the age of 60 was highly predictive of developing advanced prostate cancer, or dying of the disease, within the next 25 years.\n\nAbout one in four men will have a P.S.A. score of 2.0 or higher at the age of 60, and most of them will not develop prostate cancer, said the study’s lead author, Andrew Vickers, associate attending research methodologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. But the score does put them in a higher-risk group of men who have more to gain from regular screening, he concluded.\n\nThe higher the score at age 60, the greater the long-term risk of dying from prostate cancer, Dr. Vickers and his colleagues found. Men with a score of 2.0 or higher at age 60 were 26 times more likely to eventually die of the disease than 60-year-old men with scores below 1.0.\n\nStill, the absolute risks for men with elevated scores were lower than might be expected. A 60-year-old man with a P.S.A. score just over 2.0 had an individual risk of dying from prostate cancer during the next 25 years of about 6 percent, the researchers found. A 60-year-old man with a P.S.A. score of 5 had about a 17 percent risk.\n\n“Most of those men are going to be absolutely fine,” said Dr. Vickers. “But they can be told they are at high risk and they need screening.”\n\nMen with a P.S.A. score of 1.0 or lower at age 60 had a very low individual risk of death from prostate cancer over the next 25 years, the study found: just 0.2 percent.\n\n“They can be reassured that even if they have prostate cancer or get it, it’s unlikely to become life-threatening,” said Dr. Vickers. “There’s a strong case that they should be exempted from screening.”\n\nThe advice is less clear for men with scores between 1.0 and 2.0 at the age of 60. They still have a very low individual risk of dying from prostate cancer, judging from the new data. The long-term risk of dying from prostate cancer ranged from about 1 percent to 3 percent for these men, and the decision to screen may depend on their personal views and family histories, Dr. Vickers said.\n\nWhile the findings don’t answer all of the questions associated with P.S.A. screening, they should give peace of mind to sizable numbers of men who decide not to continue regular testing. The results also will reassure men who decide to continue with regular screenings that the benefits most likely outweigh the risks.\n\nDr. Eric A. Klein, chairman of the Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, said that he would like to see the findings of the new study independently confirmed, but that other studies also have suggested that the risk of cancer is low in men whose P.S.A. levels remain below 1.5 in their 50s and 60s.\n\n“We are in the midst of a paradigm shift in screening and risk assessment that no longer relies on a simple P.S.A. cutoff to determine who should be biopsied,” Dr. Klein said.\n\nP.S.A. screening is already not advised for those 75 and older, because the slow-moving nature of the disease means that a vast majority of men at that age are likely to die from something other than a newly detected prostate cancer. A major study last year confirmed that P.S.A. testing is not helpful for men with 10 years or less of life expectancy.\n\nBut the advice continues to be murky for younger men. In a large European study reported last year, 50- to 54-year-olds didn’t benefit from screening. But men ages 55 to 69 who had annual P.S.A. testing were slightly less likely to die from prostate cancer than those who weren’t screened.\n\nThe researchers who conducted the latest study also have investigated whether a man’s P.S.A. score at 50 can predict his long-term risk. In a 2008 report of 21,000 men published in the journal BMC Medicine, the researchers found that two-thirds of the advanced cancer cases that developed over 25 years were in men who had a P.S.A. score of 0.9 or higher at the age of 50.\n\nThose findings can help younger men decide how intensely they want to screen for the disease. A man whose P.S.A. test shows him to be at low risk at age 50 may decide not to be retested again until the age of 60. A man with a higher score may want to do more frequent testing.\n\n“We haven’t solved every single problem with screening,” Dr. Vickers noted. “We need to screen fewer people, screen the right people, and we don’t have to treat every cancer we catch.”\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on September 28, 2010, on page D1 of the New York edition of The Times.']","<span style=""font-size: larger;"">We’re not sure how much this story – or the study on which it’s based – will ""simplify"" decision-making for men facing this issue. </span>"," This story reported on a recent study that found that a man’s PSA level at age 60 was a useful indicator of his risk for developing aggressive prostate cancer within his lifetime.  While initially seeming to indicate that major groups concur that the decision to be screened for prostate cancer with this test should be a choice made by the individual man after discussion with his doctor, in the end – the story doles out clinical advice about when and how often men should be tested.  In so doing, the comment goes beyond what was supported by the study which is problematic.  In addition, although it is true that the study results reported on can be used by men to help inform their decision in terms about how to make use of their test results, the story did not appear to leave room for the man who decides against testing altogether.  Nonetheless – the story provides interesting information for men about one approach to using PSA test results to inform future decisions about testing.

After 13 minutes, patients who got CPR at the scene continued to have better survival odds but the difference was no longer statistically meaningful.\n\n“Early CPR saves lives, and the lack of CPR efforts from bystanders could result in significantly decreased chances of survival,” said lead study author Dr. Shahzleen Rajan of Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark.\n\nCardiac arrest involves the abrupt loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. Unlike a heart attack, which happens when blood flow to a portion of the heart is blocked, cardiac arrest occurs when the heart’s electrical system malfunctions, often due to irregular heart rhythms. Cardiac arrest may occur with no warning and is often fatal.\n\nChest compressions or CPR can help restore circulation, increasing the odds of survival. Bystander CPR generally won’t restore a normal heart rhythm but it can buy time by maintaining blood flow to vital organs.\n\n“We know from previous research that 1 in 8 people survive after a cardiac arrest if a bystander initiates CPR before the arrival of the emergency medical services,” Rajan said by email. “In contrast, if CPR is not initiated before the arrival of the emergency medical services, only 1 in 30 people survive a cardiac arrest.”\n\nFor the current study, researchers looked at 30-day survival for patients who had cardiac arrests outside of a hospital between 2005 and 2011.\n\nWhen the ambulance arrived within five minutes, 14.5 percent of patients in the bystander CPR group survived at least 30 days, compared with 6.3 percent in the group that didn’t get this help.\n\nFor ambulance arrival times up to ten minutes, 6.7 percent in the CPR group and 2.2 percent of the other patients survived. If the ambulance took more than 13 minutes, the survival rate was 3.7 percent in the CPR group and 1.5 percent for the others - a difference that wasn’t statistically meaningful.\n\nThe study is observational and doesn’t prove bystander CPR increases survival odds, the authors note in Circulation. Researchers also lacked data on how quickly bystanders intervened after the start of cardiac arrest, which could influence outcomes, the authors note.\n\n“Once a victim has sustained a cardiac arrest with little or no blood supply going to the heart or brain, the time to reestablishing blood flow with oxygenated blood is critical,” said Dr. Lenworth Jacobs, director of trauma and emergency medicine at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut.\n\n“It is generally thought that the sooner this is implemented the better,” Jacobs, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to bystander CPR remains that too few people know how to do it, said Dr. Peter Pons, an emergency physician in Denver and professor emeritus at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\n“Clearly, if someone has been motivated to learn and has been taught CPR, they will often assist,” Pons, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “When someone does not have that knowledge, they tend to be more reluctant to act and may fear making things worse.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2hYh4Iq Circulation, online November 22, 2016.']","The story did a good job providing exact numbers on what the researchers measured, and it mentioned a few limitations to the study.","Bystander CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) remains an underutilized resource for victims of cardiac arrest.

The story did a good job providing exact numbers on what the researchers measured, and it mentioned a few limitations to the study.

The researchers interviewed 200 patients who were undergoing a diagnostic test called angiography, an X-ray exam of the blood vessels and heart chambers that can determine if a person has coronary heart disease.\n\nThe patients were asked if they engaged in regular fasting, and the researchers compared the answers to whether they eventually received a diagnosis of heart disease. Because about 90 percent of the patients were Mormons, a faith that encourages its members to fast for one day a month, the doctors expected to find a relatively high rate of regular fasting among the study participants.\n\nThe researchers found that people who fasted regularly had a 58 percent lower risk of coronary disease compared with those who said they didn’t fast, according to the report presented at the American College of Cardiology conference in New Orleans this week.\n\nThe study showed only an association between fasting and better heart health, which means it’s possible that fasting may not have a direct effect but might just be more common among people who are healthier to begin with. Devout Mormons, for instance, abstain from alcohol, smoking and caffeine, which are all factors that could affect heart health.\n\nBut the researchers say the findings are important because they affirm the results of an earlier, larger study, published in 2008 in The American Journal of Cardiology, that found a similar association between fasting and heart disease among 448 patients.\n\n“The first study we did was not a chance finding,’’ said Dr. Benjamin D. Horne, director of cardiovascular and genetic epidemiology for Intermountain Healthcare, a health services and managed care firm in Salt Lake City. “We were able to replicate the findings and show that people who fast routinely have a lower prevalence of coronary disease.’’\n\nThe downside of the study is that it didn’t ask for specific details on the type and duration of fasting among the patients. However, preliminary interviews suggest that the most common form of fasting involved a monthly ritual of abstaining from all food and drinking only water for 24 hours.\n\nA second, smaller study conducted by the same research team suggests that the effects of fasting aren’t just about having an overall healthy lifestyle, but that abstaining from food on a regular basis leads to metabolic changes that are good for the heart.\n\nFor that research, also presented at the New Orleans conference, 30 patients were asked to fast for 24 hours with water only. The scientists used blood tests before and after the fasting period to look at a number of different metabolic markers. Among other changes, they found that levels of human growth hormone, or HGH, surged after fasting — increasing 20 times in men and 13 times in women. The hormone is released by the body in times of starvation to protect lean muscle mass and trigger the body to start burning fat stores.\n\n“There is a lot more to be done to fill in the research on the biological mechanism,’’ Dr. Horne said. “But what it does suggest is that fasting is not a marker for other healthy lifestyle behaviors. It appears to be that fasting is causing some major stress, and the body responds to that by some protective mechanisms that potentially have a beneficial long-term effect on risk of chronic disease.”\n\nDr. Horne noted that patients shouldn’t take up fasting without discussing it first with their doctor. Any fast should include water because dehydration can raise risk for stroke. He said the group was planning additional research into the potential health effects of regular fasting.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Observational studies – like ones in which you interview people about their habits and then see what happens to them – can’t prove cause and effect.  Yet the headline says a finding of this observational study is that “fasting may boost heart health.”  That’s at least misleading.</span>","This story hinted at other factors that might explain the statistical association – but didn’t drive home the limitations of an observational study. It also didn’t point out that such a cross-sectional study (the exposure – fasting – and the outcome – coronary artery disease, as measured by angiography – were measured at the same time) can’t draw any conclusions about causality.
Single source stories like this – from a team promoting its current and past line of research – demands independent perspectives.  But this story didn’t provide any.

Both girls were born premature. Grace is legally blind while Evelyn received drug therapy and her eyesight is developing normally.\n\nThe results of the study, to be published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine, were so significant that the 15 hospitals participating in the research have stopped using lasers in favor of the drug, Avastin, which is injected into the eyes of the affected newborns. Avastin, made by Roche Holding AG\'s Genentech unit, is designed to be used for treating cancer, and the company doesn\'t promote its use for any eye conditions.\n\nBabies born before 30 weeks of gestation have immature eyes and are at high risk of developing a condition called retinopathy of prematurity that is caused by uncontrolled growth of blood vessels in the eye. The blood-vessel growth can lead to scarring and detachment of the retina, which causes blindness.\n\nThe study\'s lead researcher, Helen Mintz-Hittner, an ophthalmology professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Medical School, says retinopathy of prematurity is traditionally treated with a laser procedure that requires general anesthesia. Some babies need several treatments over time, and in most cases peripheral vision can\'t be saved.\n\nDr. Mintz-Hittner estimates there are about 3,000 to 4,000 cases of retinopathy of prematurity in the U.S. each year. The numbers are increasing as more premature babies survive.\n\nAn injection of Avastin stopped blood-vessel growth. In many cases, the drug was able to successfully treat retinopathy in premature babies with just one treatment. Babies get a small amount of anesthetic to numb the eye before being injected.\n\nAvastin was designed to help treat cancer by choking off blood vessels to tumors, and doctors have been using it to treat some eye conditions. Genentech also markets a drug called Lucentis that\'s similar to Avastin and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat age-related macular degeneration, which is the leading cause of blindness in older adults.\n\nDr. Mintz-Hittner says such a small dose of Avastin is used for premature babies that it costs about $40 to treat both eyes. A comparable dose of Lucentis would be about $2,500, she says. Avastin also is preferable to Lucentis for retinopathy in infants because of the way it\'s designed. Avastin is considered a large-molecule drug, so it can\'t easily travel outside the eye area. Dr. Mintz-Hittner said a theoretical concern with Lucentis, which is a smaller molecule, is that it might travel to other parts of the body and impact necessary blood-vessel growth in babies.\n\nA Genentech spokesman said there\'s limited safety information about uses of Avastin in treating eye diseases. ""We don\'t support or promote the off-label use of Avastin,"" he said, noting that Avastin is not approved for use in the eye.\n\nAbout 150 premature babies were enrolled in the Houston-led study from March 2008 through August 2010. Half were randomized to receive Avastin and the other half received laser treatment. Seven babies died of causes unrelated to the eye treatments. The remaining 143 babies were followed for several weeks after their initial treatments to see if the retinopathy returned.\n\nOverall, retinopathy recurred in four infants treated with Avastin compared with 19 infants treated with the laser, which translates into a 20% reduction in the risk of recurrence. The results were even more significant for babies with a harder-to-treat form of the disease called zone 1, in which abnormal blood vessels form at the very back of the eye. Among infants with this form of the disease, the recurrence rate was 6% with Avastin compared with 42% for laser therapy.\n\nJames D. Reynolds, an ophthalmology professor at the University of Buffalo, wrote in an accompanying editorial that Avastin should be the treatment of choice for babies with zone 1 retinopathy of prematurity.\n\nBradley and Kelly Henry, who had two daughters born prematurely, saw first hand the outcomes of the different treatments. Their daughter Grace was born in 2004 at 24 weeks\' gestation, weighing under two pounds. She was later diagnosed with retinopathy of prematurity and had several laser treatments under Dr. Mintz-Hittner\'s care. Grace\'s left eye eventually burst after she developed glaucoma, and it had to be replaced with a glass eye. She has enough vision in the right eye to attend regular school but is considered legally blind.""It\'s hard to watch your daughter walk into a flagpole because she can\'t see,"" Ms. Henry says.\n\nBy the time the Houston-area family\'s other daughter, Evelyn, was born early last year at 26 weeks\' gestation, the Avastin study was under way. Evelyn wasn\'t enrolled but was able to receive Avastin after she was diagnosed with retinopathy.\n\nMs. Henry says she remembers being ""elated"" that Evelyn was able to receive Avastin. ""I knew what the effects of laser treatment were,"" she says. Evelyn, now 13 months old, had just one treatment with Avastin and so far appears to be developing normally, Ms. Henry and Dr. Mintz-Hittner say.\n\nThe oldest children in the Avastin study are now nearly 3-years old and appear to be developing normally, Dr. Mintz-Hittner says, adding that so far she hasn\'t seen any significant side-effects from the drug. She says doctors need to be careful not to administer Avastin too early before the abnormal blood vessels fully develop, nor too late after the blood-vessel growth causes the retina to detach.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">A multifaceted evaluation of this study and its context.

Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. But because vision damage often occurs gradually, most people with the eye disease do not realize they have it until a good deal of their sight has been lost. If caught early, though, there are medications and procedures that may help treat glaucoma. In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool. Those with the narrowest vessels at the beginning of the study were four times more likely to have developed glaucoma a decade later.\n\nGlaucoma a ‘Vision Thief’ About 3 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide have glaucoma, and the numbers are projected to rise over the next few decades as the population ages. The disease involves damage to the optic nerve, which relays images from the retina to the brain. Early detection is key, but without regular eye exams, most people don’t know they have a problem, says ophthalmologist Andrew Iwach, MD. He is the executive director of the Glaucoma Center of San Francisco and an associate clinical professor of opthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco. “We call this disease a ‘thief of vision’ because most people with it have no idea that they have lost sight until it is too late to bring it back,” Iwach says.']",The story promises information about a “new eye test” and “a new way of identifying people at risk of glaucoma years before vision loss happens.” But the test is never adequately described.  And the supposed benefits are not explained in a meaningful way.,"Stories that include claims about new technologies need to be more rigorous than this one was.  Consumers don’t need a text book or a journal article.  But our 10 criteria can be addressed readily.  And if they were, consumers would be given far more of the information they need to make sense about new approaches and research studies.

The study, called Stich, found benefits in treating people with medication only, and in treating people with a combination of bypass surgery and medication. Both approaches can be effective, with risks and benefits associated with each one.\n\n""You don\'t have a good therapy and a bad therapy, you have a choice,"" said Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology at Northwestern University\'s Feinberg School of Medicine, who wasn\'t involved with the study. ""It really is about choice and not about which is superior.""\n\nHow best to treat these patients has been fraught with uncertainty. Many patients aren\'t evaluated for heart surgery to treat diseased arteries because they don\'t suffer classic chest pain or because doctors worry that hearts weakened by heart failure won\'t benefit from the procedure. Other doctors recommend immediate bypass surgery despite a lack of vigorous studies to support that strategy.\n\nIn the Stich study, 41% of patients assigned to treatment with drugs alone died during the follow-up period, which averaged five years. That compared with a mortality rate of 36% among patients who received bypass surgery plus medication. Although the relative reduction in risk of death was 14%, the result didn\'t meet tests for statistical significance, meaning it could have resulted from chance alone.\n\nThe findings were presented Monday at the annual scientific meeting of the American College of Cardiology in New Orleans and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn many cases, patients tested for coronary-artery disease ""get put on an express train,"" said Eric J. Velazquez, a cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C., and lead investigator of the Stich study. ""By the time people realize it, they\'ve had bypass surgery.""\n\nAn arsenal of drugs has hit the market in recent decades that has transformed treatment for coronary artery disease and heart failure. Drug regimens, including aspirin, cholesterol-lowering statins, and such blood-pressure medications as beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, can either stave off blockages that cause heart attacks or reduce the heart\'s workload, easing symptoms of heart failure.\n\nThe Stich findings suggested that contrary to current practice, doctors and patients have time to consider bypass surgery over drug treatment alone. Open-heart surgery has an early risk of death, with nearly 5% of patients who underwent bypass surgery in the study dying within 30 days of surgery. The result was in line with surgical outcomes in both Europe and the U.S. for high-risk patients, Dr. Velazquez said. It was two years before the death rates in the two study groups evened out.\n\nDr. Velazquez, who isn\'t a surgeon, said that even though the study didn\'t show an overall benefit for surgery he thinks the data generally favor the more aggressive treatment. He suggested that a patient with both heart failure and coronary artery disease who has a daughter or son getting married in three months might want to avoid or delay a decision to have bypass surgery. But, he said, if a wedding was, say, three years away, surgery might offer a better chance of survival.\n\nHowever, in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine accompanying the study, James Fang, a cardiologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, said doctors ""should be comfortable"" generally that surgery isn\'t better than the best medical therapy for the kind of patients participating in the study.\n\nTwo participants in the Stich study, Donald Ferguson and Jimmy Spell, both of North Carolina, were each diagnosed eight years ago with heart failure and coronary artery disease. Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Spell both enrolled in the study at Duke and they are among the 750 participants alive at the end of the study.\n\nAt the time he signed on, Mr. Ferguson, a retired commercial refrigeration repairman, appeared so gray when he looked in the mirror that it was as if ""somebody made you over with clay,"" he said. He was assigned to the medical-therapy group.\n\nMr. Spell, a retired textile technician whose health was complicated by diabetes, was regularly so short of breath, ""I just couldn\'t do anything. I felt like my life was coming to an end,"" he said. He received bypass surgery and medication.\n\nNow 75, Mr. Ferguson still gets assignments repairing refrigeration on private airplanes. He says he keeps his temper under control, gets regular exercise and enjoys time with his grandchildren. ""I\'m still here and I don\'t intend to go anywhere,"" he said. He steadfastly takes his medicines, convinced that they are part of the reason he is still alive.\n\nMr. Spell, who is a double amputee due to complications from diabetes, nevertheless remains active with the help of prostheses. The 66-year-old said he exercises three times a week, went on a missionary trip to Brazil two years ago and has four grandchildren. He knew he could have died during surgery, but said entering the study was the right decision. ""I went from dying to living,"" he said.\n\n""If patients are informed, they will make different decisions based on their own background,"" experiences and perception of risk, said Raymond Gibbons, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic who wasn\'t involved in the study. ""I don\'t think doctors should be making the judgment for them.""\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nDuring coronary-artery bypass surgery, surgeons often use a section of a vein taken from the leg to reroute blood around a blocked coronary artery. One end of the vein is sewn or grafted onto the aorta and the other to a segment of a coronary artery below the blockage.

Data from a second arm of the study is still being evaluated.\n\nA separate study of the drug also showed signs it could work in people who first appeared not to respond to the drug.\n\nResearchers reintroduced the drug to 32 patients who were initially treated as part of a study of 634 patients.\n\nEight of the 32 got ipilimumab alone, 23 got ipilimumab plus a vaccine called gp100, and one got the vaccine alone. All of the treatments appeared safe.\n\nThe team found that in patients whose cancer initially progressed while on ipilimumab, whose who were reintroduced to the drug had a disease control rate of 65 to 75 percent, compared to zero in the patient who got the vaccine only.\n\n“These findings may have implications for the use of ipilimumab therapy in the long-term management of advanced melanoma,” the researchers reported in the abstract.\n\nMelanoma accounts for about 3 percent of skin cancer cases but causes most skin cancer deaths, and doctors have few effective treatments to offer once the disease has spread.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, melanoma accounted for more than 68,000 cases of skin cancer in 2009, and 8,650 deaths.']","Another example of the perils of rushing to report on abstracts released weeks in advance of the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting.  The story fails to provide needed context and explanation, to provide any interviews with anyone, and to disclose potential financial conflicts of interest.

This story offers tantalizing hints of potential benefits of an experimental drug for melanoma, ipilimumab, but without any substance that would allow readers to judge the merits of the claims. It relies on readers to know that medical meeting presentations do not go through the sort of peer review required by leading journals. It expects readers to know what a “phase II” trial is and what sort of limitations that fact implies about the value (or lack thereof) of the study conclusions. The story fails to provide context or interpretation. Indeed, the reporter did not include any comments from anyone; the story is essentially a summary of a summary.
The story highlights a trial that is claimed to be a “first;” specifically the “first to test ipilimumab in patients whose skin cancer had spread to the brain.” How significant is that step? Other than saying that brain tumors are difficult to treat, the story doesn’t explain what is newsworthy about this trial.
A more serious failure is lack of disclosure that the trials and researchers received funding from companies developing the experimental drug. The story also appears to misstate the design of the second trial that it mentions.

Such an analysis is months away. And they pointed out that the study offers no reassurance about the safety of smoking or the advisability of CT scans for younger smokers or nonsmokers.\n\n“No one should come away from this thinking that it’s now safe to continue to smoke,” said Dr. Harold E. Varmus, director of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nPhoto\n\nPatients wishing to get a CT lung screen will most likely have to pay the roughly $300 charge themselves, since few insurers pay for such scans unless an illness is suspected. The federal Medicare program will soon reconsider paying for such screens, a Medicare official said.\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, was conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network and the cancer institute. It involved more than 53,000 people ages 55 to 74 who had smoked at least 30 pack-years — one pack a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years. Ex-smokers who had quit within the previous 15 years were included in the group.\n\nEach was given either a standard chest X-ray or a low-dose CT scan at the start of the trial and then twice more over the next two years. Participants were followed for up to five years. There were 354 lung cancer deaths among those who received CT scans and 442 among those who got X-rays. The $250 million study, which began in 2002, was paid for by the cancer institute and carried out at 33 sites.\n\nIts preliminary results were announced days after an independent monitoring board determined that the benefits of CT scans were strong enough to stop the trial. The study will be published in the coming months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe study found that for every 300 people who were screened, one person lived who would otherwise have died during the study. But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. These false signals generally led to more worry, more CT scans and sometimes to lung biopsies and thoracic surgery.\n\n“There are economic, medical and psychological consequences of finding these abnormalities,” Dr. Varmus said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. Dr. Henschke’s research has been controversial because of its statistical methods and its financing, which included money from a tobacco company. She earns royalties from makers of CT machines.\n\n“What we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema” and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. “Those are the three big killers of older people. There is just tremendous potential.”\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Dr. Edward F. Patz Jr., professor of radiology at Duke who helped devise the study, said he was far from convinced that a thorough analysis would show that widespread CT screening would prove beneficial in preventing most lung cancer deaths. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease.\n\n“If we look at this study carefully, we may suggest that there is some benefit in high-risk individuals, but I’m not there yet,” Dr. Patz said.\n\nSince 46 million people in the United States smoke and tens of millions more once smoked, a widespread screening program could cost billions annually. Any further refinement of those most at risk could reduce those costs. Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms. Little is known about how the cumulative risks of years of such scans would balance the benefits.\n\nThe study’s results could have both legal and political consequences. Suits against tobacco companies have sought to force cigarette makers to pay for annual CT screens of former smokers. But with the science uncertain, those claims have so far been rebuffed. Congress has diverted some research money to create pilot CT lung screening programs, diversions that may gain momentum now.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome Obama administration officials argued during the debate on the health care law that patients’ health was often harmed by getting too many tests and procedures that, if reduced, would improve health while reducing costs. This study suggests that, at least in lung cancer, spending more on tests saves lives.\n\nLaurie Fenton, president of the Lung Cancer Alliance, which has lobbied for widespread CT lung screening, said the debate about the advisability of such scans is now over.\n\n“The challenge now shifts from proving the efficacy of the method to developing the proper quality standards, infrastructure and guidelines to bring this needed benefit to those at high risk for the disease — now,” Ms. Fenton said.\n\nBut Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said no one should rush out and get a CT scan yet because further analysis will better define whom the screening helped.\n\n“Very soon we’ll have an answer about who should be screened and how frequently,” Dr. Bach said, “but we don’t have that answer today.”""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">As solid as this story was, we wish it had reported that 300 needed to be scanned in order for one life to be extended.  That means that 299 had to be scanned, run the risks, run up the costs of scanning and unnecessary followup testing or treatment – with no life extension benefit. </span>","



This story concisely reports the announcement that the long-anticipated National Lung Screening Trial indicates that heavy smokers who were offered a certain type of CT scan were less likely to die of lung cancer than similar smokers who were offered chest x-rays. It includes valuable comments that help readers understand what was found and, more importantly, some of the limitations on what is known.
However, the lead sentence skews the story by highlighting that researchers saw a 20 percent relative difference in lung cancer death rates, while failing to make it clear that the absolute difference in death rates was much less than one percent, because of the small number of few lung cancer deaths in either the CT (354 or 1.32%) or x-ray (442 or 1.65%) group compared to the size of the total trial population (about 53,500). The National Cancer Institute reported that 300 smokers would have to undergo screening in order for one life to be extended. Readers should have been shown that aspect of the results.

Some previous studies have suggested that the earlier detection helps, while other research concluded it may do more harm than good by spotting too many benign growths.\n\nThe massive National Lung Screening Trial enrolled 53,000 current or former smokers to try to settle the debate. It found 20 percent fewer deaths from lung cancer among those screened with spiral CTs than among those given chest X-rays, the NCI said Thursday, a difference significant enough that it ended the study early.\n\nThe actual number of deaths averted was fairly modest - 354 died in the spiral CT group over the eight-year study period compared with 442 deaths among those who got chest X-rays.\n\nThe NCI said it is not clear that all smokers should get the scans, which are not risk-free.\n\nThe best advice for avoiding lung cancer remains to quit smoking, said NCI Director Dr. Harold Varmus.\n\nStill, ""a validated approach that can reduce lung cancer mortality by even 20 percent has the potential to spare very significant numbers of people from the ravages of this disease,"" he said.\n\nAbout 200,000 new lung cancers are diagnosed in the U.S. each year, and the disease kills about 159,000 people annually. It is most often diagnosed at advanced stages, and the average five-year survival rate is just 15 percent.\n\nMany smokers already had sought out spiral CTs, even though the American Cancer Society hasn\'t recommended the test - citing a lack of clear evidence that they work - and most insurance doesn\'t cover the $300 to $400 cost.\n\nThe scans aren\'t risk-free: They frequently mistake scar tissue from an old infection or some other benign lump for cancer, leading to unnecessary biopsies or surgery that in turn can cause a collapsed lung, infection or other problems.\n\nThe NCI still is compiling rates of false alarms and other risks from the study.\n\nNor is it clear if the study results are applicable to all smokers. The trial enrolled people ages 55 to 74 who were or had been very heavy smokers and gave them one scan a year for three years.\n\nWhile the spiral CTs emit less radiation than standard CT scans used to diagnose disease, researchers also will analyze whether the radiation exposures from three scans changes a smoker\'s lifetime risk of other radiation-related cancers.

It’s clear that this story worked very hard to avoid hyping the results of the National Lung Screening Trial, which found that heavy smokers who were offered certain CT scans were less likely to die of lung cancer than those who were offered chest x-rays. It quickly puts the relative difference in death rates (20 percent) into context with the actual numbers (354 vs. 442 deaths among 53,500 participants). Near the top, this story tells readers of doubts about the balance of harms and benefits of this type of screening. It emphasizes that quitting smoking is the best way to avoid lung cancer death. However, it appears that the story is mostly based on material handed out by the National Cancer Institute, which sponsored the trial. It fails to give readers any independent perspectives on the trial or the meaning of its results. Even a call to the American Cancer Society would have provided a cautious viewpoint.

A very high consumption of non-fermented dairy products, on the other hand, was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease. The findings were published in the British Journal of Nutrition.\n\nEarlier studies have shown that fermented dairy products have more positive effects on blood lipid profiles and on the risk of heart disease than other dairy products. Examples of fermented dairy products include cheese, yoghurt, quark, kefir and sour milk. However, research into the topic remains scarce.\n\nThe Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study ongoing at the University of Eastern Finland explored the associations of fermented and non-fermented dairy products with the risk of incident coronary heart disease. Approximately 2,000 men participated in the study. Their dietary habits were assessed at the beginning of the study in 1984-1989, and they were followed up for an average of 20 years. During this follow-up, 472 men experienced an incident coronary heart disease event.\n\nThe study participants were divided into groups on the basis of how much they ate different dairy products, and the researchers compared the groups with the highest and lowest consumption, while also taking various lifestyle and nutrition factors into consideration.\n\nWhen the study participants were divided into four groups on the basis of their consumption of fermented dairy products with less than 3.5% fat, the risk of incident coronary heart disease was 26% lower in the highest consumption group compared to the lowest consumption group. Sour milk was the most commonly used low-fat fermented dairy product. The consumption of high-fat fermented dairy products, such as cheese, was not associated with the risk of incident coronary heart disease.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that a very high consumption on non-fermented dairy products was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease. Milk was the most commonly used product in this category, and a very high consumption was defined as an average daily milk intake of 0.9 litres. Lower consumption levels were not associated with the risk.\n\n""Here in Finland, people\'s habits of consuming different dairy products have changed over the past decades. For instance, the consumption of milk and sour milk have declined, while many fermented dairy products, such as yoghurt, quark and cheeses, have gained in popularity,"" Adjunct Professor Jyrki Virtanen from the University of Eastern Finland says.\n\nThe new study provides further evidence on the health benefits that fermented dairy products may have over non-fermented ones. All the mechanisms are not understood yet, but they may be linked to compounds forming during the fermentation process.\n\n###\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nJyrki Virtanen, PhD, Adjunct Professor in Nutrition Epidemiology (principal investigator).

The research question is: how do fermented dairy products (like yogurt, kefir, sour milk, cottage cheese, and quark) compare with non-fermented dairy (mostly milk) when it comes to the risk of heart attacks?
The authors of this study of just under 2,000 men report that men who consumed more low-fat/fermented dairy had lower rates of heart attack compared with men who consumed less of those products.
But we get no sense of just how much difference there was between the groups, the volumes of dairy that had to be consumed, or what limitations of the study might make the findings debatable. Further, the release engages in some cause-and-effect language when describing fermented dairy products’ potential affect on cardiovascular health but these kinds of claims can’t be supported by an observational study.
Fortunately, the news release does not use unjustifiable language, and does make it clear that the mechanisms of action behind the study’s findings are not completely understood.

The company expects a decision by May.\n\nThe drug has been available in Europe and Canada for several years.\n\nTwo other oral medications indicated to treat uterine fibroids are also in development. Bayer launched a phase 3 clinical trial—usually the final trial used by regulators to decide whether to approve a drug—for a similar drug, vilaprisan, in the summer. And AbbeVie is in the midst of phase 3 trials for elagolix to treat uterine fibroids and endometriosis, a disorder in which the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, causing pelvic pain. The company hopes to have a product available by 2020.\n\nUterine fibroids are benign tumors that grow in and around the uterus. It’s estimated that as many as 26 million women in the U.S. have one or more such tumors, though less than half experience symptoms. The most common symptom is long and excessive bleeding during menstrual periods, which can lead to anemia and the need for blood transfusions. Other symptoms can include pelvic pain or pressure, a swollen abdomen and frequent urination. Fibroids can also cause fertility and pregnancy problems, depending on their size and location.\n\nThe cause of fibroids remains unknown, though those with a family history have an increased risk of developing them. Dietary factors may also play a role. African-American women have a higher rate of uterine fibroids. If a woman has no symptoms, treatment of fibroids isn’t necessary, experts say.\n\nWhile a hysterectomy is the most common way to treat fibroid tumors, women who still want to have children can have a myomectomy. That surgery removes fibroids while keeping the uterus intact. But fibroids can grow back after the procedure. A number of other minimally invasive procedures are less commonly used and usually not recommended for women who want to have children. There’s some chance of recurrence with most of them.\n\nUA belongs to a group of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM). They block the progesterone from feeding the fibroids, which causes them to shrink.\n\n“This particular drug also works directly on the lining of the uterus—the endometrium—so it also quite fast and dramatically decreases and stops the vaginal bleeding,” says Ayman Al-Hendy, director of interdisciplinary translational research at Augusta University in Georgia and a member of Allergan’s advisory board. Bleeding is reduced within five to six days, he says. Headaches and hot flashes were the most common side effects in the trials with UA, affecting less than 10% of women.\n\nPatients take the once-a-day pill for three months and then stop for one menstrual cycle to allow the endometrium to shed, since the medication makes it grow thicker. Dr. Al-Hendy says the changes to the endometrium don’t raise the risk of endometrial cancer, which some have raised as a concern.\n\nPatients with the condition say it’s time for better treatments.\n\nTanika Gray Valbrun, a 39-year-old Atlanta resident, started the White Dress Project, a nonprofit patient advocacy group for women with uterine fibroids, to help raise awareness of the common condition and to lobby for more funding for research. Photo: Paras Griffin/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nTanika Gray Valbrun, a 39-year-old network news producer in Atlanta, says she welcomes less invasive treatments that don’t affect fertility. She started the White Dress Project, a nonprofit patient advocacy group for women with uterine fibroids, in 2014.\n\nShe was diagnosed with fibroids at 19. She has suffered from pelvic pain, abdominal bloating that has resulted in people mistakenly thinking she’s pregnant and extremely heavy bleeding that has left her anemic.\n\n“I’ve had five blood transfusions because of the amount of blood I’ve lost,” she says.\n\nShe has tried different types of birth control, but none helped with her symptoms. In 2013 she had a myomectomy and doctors removed 27 fibroids, keeping her out of work for nine weeks. Four years later, the fibroids are back.\n\nUterine fibroids are most commonly treated with a hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus. They are the leading cause of hysterectomies. Photo: Getty Images\n\nVanessa Jacoby, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at University of California, San Francisco, conducts research in new fibroid treatments.\n\nShe says UA appears to have fewer side effects than Lupron, the only medication, an injectable, available in the U.S. that shrinks fibroids. Lupron effectively puts women into early menopause, which can result in hot flashes and bone loss. Women often must take it with hormone replacement therapy. It is usually used in preparation for surgery to shrink fibroids and maintain blood reserves.\n\nWhile the company has done studies of women taking the drug up to a year, some experts believe the long-term health profile of a drug needs to be evaluated up to seven years, Dr. Jacoby says.\n\nShao-Lee Lin, vice president of therapeutic areas and international development at AbbVie, says the company is testing a twice daily dosing of elagolix. It is also studying including low-dose hormone therapy within elagolix to help maintain bone health.\n\nLike Lupron, elagolix decreases sex hormones that cause fibroids to grow.

Patients with Parkinson\'s disease or other parkinsonian syndromes have scans that show low levels of dopamine, the neurotransmitter critical in controlling movement and other muscle functions.\n\n\n\nIn cases where a diagnosis isn\'t necessarily clear-cut, the DaTscan offers important advances in patient care and treatment, said Dr. Michael Rezak, director of the Movement Disorders Center at Central DuPage Hospital, where the scan is offered.\n\n\n\n""DaTscan is used in difficult-to-diagnose cases and must be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation and a patient\'s response to medications,"" Rezak said. ""The earlier we get treatment started, the better. Before DaTscan we would watch and wait because there were no other objective tests to use. Now we can get a diagnosis sooner.""\n\n\n\nThe DaTscan injection was first used in Europe a decade ago, and GE Healthcare made it available to U.S. hospitals in late June. It is the first ""radiopharmaceutical adjunct imaging agent"" approved by the Food and Drug Administration that helps physicians better evaluate patients who are thought to have Parkinson\'s disease or other parkinsonian syndromes.\n\n\n\nApproval of DaTscan followed two Phase 3 clinical trials in which 284 adult patients with tremors were studied. During an FDA advisory panel meeting, committee members were mostly positive about DaTscan, though one neurologist objected to the average $1,500 cost of a scan versus $150 for a month\'s supply of carbidopa or levodopa medications for a Parkinson\'s patient, according to Medscape Medical News.\n\n\n\n""I was thrilled there was something that could positively tell me I had Parkinson\'s because everybody had guessed what I had,"" said Ray Ramas, 56, who in June became the first patient at Central DuPage to undergo the scan.\n\n\n\nBefore the test, Ramas, of West Chicago, experienced two years of uncertainty about his health as several specialists tried to pinpoint the cause of his joint and tendon pain, fatigue, stiffness in his legs and lack of bladder control. Eventually he developed a tremor in his right arm.\n\n\n\nHis doctor said he might have fibromyalgia and sent him to a rheumatologist. Another specialist said his symptoms suggested parkinsonian syndrome, caused by various neurodegenerative disorders that share some features of Parkinson\'s. ""Another doctor ... wanted me to see a psychiatrist because he thought my symptoms were all in my head,"" Ramas recalled.\n\n\n\nBy March, Ramas could hardly walk. He visited the emergency room at Central DuPage, where he was sent to Rezak, who told him about DaTscan.\n\n\n\n""I lay on a table, got an injection and the procedure took about 20 minutes. It was like getting my blood drawn,"" he said. In two days, Ramas found out he had Parkinson\'s disease.\n\n\n\n""Many patients are gratified to know what they\'re dealing with. It allows them to accept treatment earlier,"" Rezak said. Since June, 25 men and women of all ages have been tested with DaTscan at Central DuPage, Rezak said.\n\n\n\nNorthwestern Memorial Hospital has used DaTscan since October 2010 as part of a multicenter trial study, said Dr. William Spies, associate director of nuclear medicine at Northwestern.\n\n\n\nAs part of the study, recently diagnosed Parkinson\'s patients and healthy subjects are tested with DaTscan, and clinical and behavioral assessments are done to identify biomarkers of Parkinson\'s disease progression.\n\n\n\nDaTscan was first used at the University of Chicago Medical Center in August on a 75-year-old male patient who exhibited essential tremors, parkinsonian syndrome and some rigidity and slowness, said Dr. Tao Xie, assistant professor of neurology at the Medical Center\'s Center for Parkinson\'s Disease and Movement Disorders.\n\n\n\n""In the past, we would have had to wait to diagnose Parkinson\'s or chosen different medications to test, which might have had different side effects, and this would have delayed the timely diagnosis of Parkinson\'s,"" Xie said.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">This story about a Parkinson’s disease test that was recently approved for use in the U.S. displays a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of the new test. </span></span></span>","



The DaTscan is intended to help doctors rule out Parkinson’s disease when the underlying cause of their symptoms is difficult to determine, but the patient example and overall tone of the story convey that the test is meant to uncover Parkinson’s cases that other tests and exams have missed. The story does not address the lack of evidence about whether this test can improve patient outcomes. The story fails to offer readers any independent voices, relying only on doctors at institutions that are actively marketing their ability to offer a test that not all of their competitors have. The story also fails to address the potential harms of this test, including a risk of thyroid cancer if uptake of radioactive iodine in the test solution is not properly blocked.

The study will be presented Sunday, June 5, 2016 at the 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.\n\n""The response rate is better than we\'ve seen for other potential second-line treatments and nivolumab is really well-tolerated, which is important because bladder cancer patients are a fragile group after frontline treatment with platinum chemotherapy,"" said Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology at MD Anderson.\n\nNivolumab unleashes an immune system attack on cancer by blocking activation of a protein called PD-1 on T cells, white blood cells that find and attack cells, viruses or bacteria that have specific targets. PD-1 acts as a brake, or checkpoint, to shut down activated T cells. PD-1 is turned on by a ligand called PD-L1, which is often found on cancer cells and other types of cells.\n\nThe presence of PD-L1 on a patient\'s tumor has been considered a potential biomarker to guide treatment. The study found no significant difference in response rates between those with little to no PD-L1 on their tumors (26 percent) and those with greater PD-L1 expression (24 percent).\n\n""We can get good results without choosing to treat patients based on PD-L1 status,"" said Sharma, who also is scientific director of MD Anderson\'s immunotherapy platform and an investigator with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at MD Anderson. The platform is part of MD Anderson\'s Moon Shots Program, launched in 2013 to reduce cancer deaths by accelerating development of therapies, prevention efforts and early detection from scientific discoveries.\n\nThis Phase I/II clinical trial treated 78 patients: five (6.4 percent) had complete responses, 14 (18 percent) had partial responses, in which tumor burden shrinks by at least 30 percent, and 22 (28.2 percent) had stable disease. Thirty (38 percent) patients had disease progression.\n\nTreatment-related side effects included mainly low-grade fatigue, itching, elevated lipase, rash, nausea, joint pain and anemia. Grade 3 or 4 side effects occurred in 20.5 percent of patients. Two patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events related to the drug.\n\nAt a median follow up of 213 days, 33.3 percent remained on treatment, and 45.6 percent of patients survived for at least one year, which Sharma noted ""is better than anything we\'ve seen in the past.""\n\nOverall survival will be analyzed in conjunction with the Phase II portion of this clinical trial, which provides nivolumab or a combination of nivolumab plus the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab. The trial allows patients to cross over to the combination if nivolumab alone fails.\n\nInitial results from the Phase II portion of the trial will be presented later this year.\n\nBoth nivolumab, known as Opdivo, and ipilimumab, known as Yervoy, were developed and marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which funded the clinical trial.\n\nIpilimumab targets the CTLA-4 checkpoint on T cells and was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor. It was based on the research of Jim Allison, Ph.D., chair of Immunology, executive director of the immunotherapy platform and director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at MD Anderson.\n\nIpilimumab was the first drug ever shown to extend the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. Long-term follow up shows 22 percent of those treated with the drug survive 10 years or longer.\n\nNivolumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for advanced melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. The five-year survival rate for those with metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab is 34 percent. The two-year survival rate of patients treated with both drugs in combination is 69 percent.\n\nUntil May 18, there were no drugs approved for second-line treatment of metastatic bladder cancer. The U.S. FDA approved atezolizumab, which blocks PD-L1, for these patients.\n\n###\n\nCo-authors with Sharma, who presented the data at ASCO, are Petri Bono, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland; Joseph Kim, Yale Cancer Center; Pavlina Spiliopoulou, Beatson, West of Scotland Cancer Centre, Glasgow; Emiliano Calvo, Centro Integral Oncológico Clara Campal, Madrid,Spain; Rathi Pillai, Emory Winship Cancer Institute, Atlanta; Patrick Ott, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston; Filippo DeBraud, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy; Michael Morse, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C.; Dung Le, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore; Dirk Jaeger, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany; Emily Chan, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tenn.; Chris Harbison, Chen-Sheng Lin, Marina Tschaika, Alex Azrilevich, of Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Jonathan Rosenberg of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.']","Good overview of the benefits of immunotherapy for advanced bladder cancer but could have used more details on  study parameters, costs and industry relationships.","The release offers an overview of clinical trial results that were presented June 5 at the annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The release notes that the drug nivolumab (which is marketed as Opdivo) shrunk the tumors of 24 percent (19 of 78) of patients with metastatic bladder cancer who received the drug.
Like a number of other drugs that have been significant advances in cancer treatment, the drug is an antibody that stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells. It is already approved to treat a number of other cancers (advanced melanoma, lung, kidney, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma). Also of significance: Most of the patients had undergone at least two other courses of treatment. According to the quoted researcher, the 45% survival rate at one year is better than seen with other treatments for this cancer.
The release addresses many factors, but does not offer much detail about the study itself and doesn’t address cost — which is likely to be significant — or the fact the lead researcher served on an advisory board to the drug maker.

(February 17, 2016) - U.S. children are not consuming enough vegetables, resulting in an inadequate intake of key nutrients, including potassium and dietary fiber, which are important for growth, development and overall health. Research published (January 2016) in a special supplement of the peer-reviewed journal Advances in Nutrition demonstrated that children ages 1-3 years of age consumed just 67 percent of the dietary reference intakes (DRI) for potassium and 55 percent of the DRI for fiber.\n\nAn overarching conclusion from the various papers included in the supplement, ""Science and Policy: Adopting a Fruitful Vegetable Encounter for Our Children,"" is that potatoes are a vegetable that tend to be well-liked by young children and are a good source of potassium and provide 8 percent of the recommended daily value of fiber. In fact, a study of elementary school students demonstrated that students are not consuming the majority of vegetables offered to them in school lunches. However, plate waste for white potatoes was the lowest among any type of vegetables; thus, including potatoes in school meals is one important way to help ensure children receive those key nutrients of concern.\n\n""It\'s important that consumption of all vegetables, particularly those that are good sources of potassium and dietary fiber, be encouraged in children,"" says Theresa A. Nicklas, DrPH, USDA/ARS Children\'s Nutrition Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, and one of the supplement\'s authors. ""Dietary habits established during childhood often transition to adulthood, so it is hugely important to encourage children to enjoy vegetables as part of the diet in order to reap the nutrition and health benefits provided by vegetables into adulthood.""\n\nThe journal supplement features seven papers authored by leading nutrition scientists that explore the state of the science pertaining to vegetable consumption in children. The supplement is the outcome of a November 2014 USDA/ARS Children\'s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine roundtable on vegetable consumption in children. The forum was supported by the Alliance for Potato Research and Education, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to expanding and translating scientific research into evidence-based policy and education initiatives that recognize the role of all forms of the potato--a nutritious vegetable--in promoting health for all age groups.

It strains to find the best possible slice of information in a study full of numbers that are otherwise ignored about the low intake among children of important nutrients from vegetables.,"This news release is about a study funded by and written by the potato industry. And not surprisingly given its provenance, the news release advocates vigorously for the inclusion of more potatoes in children’s diets. Interestingly, though, the study that’s the basis for the release does not deliver the same message. Instead, it says that a broad array of vegetables are not being eaten by children and therefore children’s diets are lacking in calcium, vitamin D, and other nutrients. Potatoes are a big focus of the study, of course, but here’s where the news release falls short, too: The study notes — and the news release ignores — that the potatoes being studied included french fries and potato chips. All potential health harm from these foods is completely ignored. (Such harm is ignored in the study, too.) The potential benefits are not clearly broken out in the study and seem to appear out of nowhere in the news release.

Most previous evidence showing benefits from the Mediterranean diet was gathered through observational studies, a less conclusive research technique.\n\n“This was the first clinical, randomized study using a dietary pattern for good health,” said Emilio Ros, who led the study at Hospital Clinic, part of the University of Barcelona in Spain. Data gathered from previous observational studies suggested that adhering to a Mediterranean-type diet related to better cognitive function and a reduced risk of dementia, but observational studies have limitations, he said. “This clinical trial removes the bias and provides first-level evidence,” said Dr. Ros, director of the lipid clinic at Hospital Clinic’s endocrinology department.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet, which has also shown benefits in cardiovascular health, emphasizes vegetables and fruits, unrefined grains and beans. It also includes fish and wine and minimal consumption of meat and full-fat dairy products.\n\nThe study involved 447 cognitively healthy participants, 55 to 80 years of age, who were divided into three groups. Two groups followed the Mediterranean diet and added either 30 grams of mixed nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts and almonds) a day, or five tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil a day. The third group, acting as a control, was advised to follow a low-fat diet. The subjects were followed for a median of just over four years.\n\nThe results showed that, compared with the control group, memory function remained stronger in the Mediterranean diet plus nuts group, while frontal (attention and executive function) and global cognition benefited in the Mediterranean diet plus olive oil group.\n\nThe diminished decline in cognitive function likely stems from the abundance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents found in the supplemental foods, Dr. Ros said. Olive oil and nuts are rich in phenolic compounds that might counteract oxidative processes in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration, the study said. “If you can delay your age-related cognitive decline, you can process tasks with higher speed,” said Dr. Ros.\n\nJane Cerhan, a clinical neuropsychologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who wasn’t involved in the research, said clinical studies of age-related cognitive decline are needed in regard to diet, “which is why this study is an extra good one, because of its size and randomized design.” However, she said: “The changes observed in cognition were very small and didn’t actually show that those diets improved cognition, they just showed less decline.” Based on the research, she said, people shouldn’t rush out to buy lots of olive oil and nut, but she encourages they follow a balanced diet that includes healthy foods such as these.\n\nThe research was a substudy of a larger investigation, designed by Dr. Ros, that found the Mediterranean diet, supplemented with additional olive oil or nuts, reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events among people at high cardiovascular risk. That study, which involved nearly 7,500 participants and known by the acronym Predimed, was published in 2013.\n\nIn the latest study, Dr. Ros said participants were given 1 liter of olive oil per week, but that amount was intended for their entire household. He recommends that, to decrease age-related cognitive delay, people should add 5 tablespoons of olive oil as well as a handful of nuts per day into their diet.\n\n“I like walnuts, which are high in omega-3 fatty acids,” he said. In general, he would like to see everyone improve their diets “by eating more fish, less meat, and improving your legume intake.” He also suggested adding the Spanish “sofrito” sauce of slowly simmering tomatoes, onions, and garlic in olive oil to dress rice and pasta dishes in weekly menus. “We believe this is an antioxidant cocktail.”\n\nThe study was funded by the Spanish government. Dr. Ros has previously received research funding from the California Walnut Commission and is a nonpaid member of the group’s scientific advisory committee, the study said.']",The main deficiency of this otherwise strong report is that it didn’t caution readers about the cost of buying some 50 liters of olive oil annually to replicate this diet.,"This story does a nice job describing why a study delving into the impact of various versions of the Mediterranean diet on cognitive function is more rigorous than previous efforts. And its provision of strong comments from an independent expert help readers gauge the scope of the potential benefits. There are a few missing components that would have made the story even more useful for readers, including some acknowledgment of the cost of 4 liters of high-quality olive oil per month. We also wonder if there are other ways to potentially slow down the cognitive decline associated with aging that the story could have explored.

This is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service, standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures.\n\nPatients with advanced cancers often have significant symptoms that affect their emotional status, quality of life, and functional ability. The integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use, yet many patients are never offered these services.\n\n“As cancer progresses, patients are often at high risk for physical pain and emotional distress,” said Cardinale B. Smith, MD, MSCR, Associate Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Medical Oncology), and of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “Health care utilization is extremely high once cancer progresses, with hospital readmission rates as high as 40 percent and death in the acute care setting ranging from 30-50 percent – both measures of poor-quality cancer care.”\n\nTo improve the quality of care, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine developed standardized criteria or “triggers” for palliative care consultation for patients admitted to the cancer unit at The Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients were eligible for this prospective cohort study if they met one or more eligibility criteria: advanced solid tumor cancer, prior hospitalization within 30 days, hospitalization for more than 7 days, or active symptoms.\n\n“Care for patients with advanced cancer is often characterized by time spent on acute-care hospital wards and intensive care units, or receiving invasive procedures, chemotherapy infusions, and radiographic imaging. Such interventions drive escalating costs and are often directly in conflict with patients’ prior stated wishes,” said Dr. Smith.\n\nConsultation with the palliative care team included establishment of goals of care, advance care plans using standardized communication protocols, transition planning and symptom assessment and treatment using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). The palliative team was composed of one board certified PC physician, one nurse practitioner, one social worker, a chaplain, and one to two trainees.\n\n“Our results highlight the need to adopt this practice at acute care hospitals across the nation,” said Dr. Smith. “Palliative care involvement helps patients understand their prognosis, establish goals of care, and formulate discharge plans in line with those goals, and this study is the first to confirm the impact of using standardized criteria and automatic palliative care consultation on quality of cancer care.”\n\nCo-authors of the study include Kerin Adelson, MD, Division of Hematology/Oncology at Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nAbout the Mount Sinai Health SystemThe Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health system committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education. Structured around seven hospital campuses and a single medical school, the Health System has an extensive ambulatory network and a range of inpatient and outpatient services—from community-based facilities to tertiary and quaternary care.\n\nThe System includes approximately 7,100 primary and specialty care physicians; 12 joint-venture ambulatory surgery centers; more than 140 ambulatory practices throughout the five boroughs of New York City, Westchester, Long Island, and Florida; and 31 affiliated community health centers. Physicians are affiliated with the renowned Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which is ranked among the highest in the nation in National Institutes of Health funding per investigator. The Mount Sinai Hospital is in the “Honor Roll” of best hospitals in America, ranked No. 15 nationally in the 2016-2017 “Best Hospitals” issue of U.S. News & World Report. The Mount Sinai Hospital is also ranked as one of the nation’s top 20 hospitals in Geriatrics, Gastroenterology/GI Surgery, Cardiology/Heart Surgery, Diabetes/Endocrinology, Nephrology, Neurology/Neurosurgery, and Ear, Nose & Throat, and is in the top 50 in four other specialties. New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai is ranked No. 10 nationally for Ophthalmology, while Mount Sinai Beth Israel, Mount Sinai St. Luke\'s, and Mount Sinai West are ranked regionally. Mount Sinai’s Kravis Children’s Hospital is ranked in seven out of ten pediatric specialties by U.S. News & World Report in ""Best Children\'s Hospitals.""\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.mountsinai.org/, or find Mount Sinai on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\n# # #']",Absolute numbers — readily available in the study — showing the results were not included in the news release. But the release provides good context in other areas.,"This news release reports results of a study that found that patients with advanced cancers who were referred early to palliative care made better use of support services, including palliative chemotherapy, after being discharged and had fewer hospital re-admissions and invasive treatments.
Researchers at Mount Sinai Hospital obtained their data through a prospective cohort study (one that follows a group of patients over time to observe specific outcomes). Unfortunately, the absolute numbers — readily available in the study — showing the results were not included in the news release. But the release does provide good context in other areas, particularly in explaining what palliative care is and what it entails for patients.

They have designed a ""granular jamming cap"" filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods. They are disclosing the novel design and data on its effectiveness at the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions in Barcelona on June 20.\n\nOf course, the coffee grounds are not loose: they form a thin layer inside a stretchy silicone headpiece, which looks something like a black latex swim cap decorated with reflective dots. After the cap is placed on the patient\'s head, it is attached to a vacuum pump that sucks the air out of the cap, jamming the tiny grounds together to form a rigid layer that conforms closely to the shape of the patient\'s head. (This is the same effect that turns vacuum-packed coffee into solid bricks.)\n\nBefore surgery, a special scanner is used to map the location of the dots relative to key features on the patient\'s head: a process called registration. Then, during surgery an overhead camera observes the position of the dots allowing the navigation system to accurately track the position of the patient\'s head when the surgeon repositions it. The computer uses this information to combine a CT scan, which provides a detailed 3-D view of the bone and soft tissue hidden inside the patient\'s head, with the position of the instruments the surgeon is using and displays them together in real time on a monitor in the operating room.\n\n""These are very delicate operations and a sophisticated image guidance system has been developed to help the surgeons, but they don\'t trust the system because sometimes it is spot on and other times it is off the mark,"" said Robert Webster, associate professor of mechanical engineering and otolaryngology, who is developing a surgical robot designed specifically for endonasal surgery. ""When we heard about this, we began wondering what was causing these errors and we decided to investigate.""\n\nWhen Webster and his research team looked into the matter, they were surprised by what they found. They discovered it wasn\'t the hardware or the software in the guidance system that was causing the problem. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient\'s head that was at fault. Typically, these ""fiducial markers"" are attached by an elastic headband and double-backed tape and are subject to jarring and slipping. Their tests found that skin movement and accidental bumps by operating room staff both produced large tracking errors.\n\n""The basic assumption is that, after registration, the spatial relationships between the patient\'s head and the fiducial markers remains constant,"" said Patrick Wellborn, the graduate student who is making the presentation. ""Unfortunately, that is not the case. For one thing, studies have shown that the skin on a person\'s forehead can move as much as a half an inch relative to the skull. And accidentally bumping or dragging cables over the headband can also produce significant targeting errors.""\n\nIn fact, previous research has found that when everything goes well, the guidance system produces targeting errors of about 2 millimeters but, in about one operation out of seven, the target error is much larger, forcing the surgeon to redo the registration process.\n\n""Actually, we do have a solution to this problem but it involves drilling and attaching the markers directly to the skull...which we don\'t like to do because it is painful and it\'s a step backwards from the majority of what we are doing,"" said Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology Paul Russell, who is collaborating with the engineers on the project.\n\nSo the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. Webster recalled some experiments that were done using coffee grounds to help robots grip irregularly shaped objects. Bladders filled with coffee grounds were built into the robot\'s gripper. When it grabbed an object, the bladders conformed to its shape. Then a vacuum was pulled, the coffee grounds became rigid and locked the object into place. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem.\n\nIn the last three years, they have gone through a number of designs. They began with headbands that had coffee-ground-filled bags over the temples. Their tests showed that these models could reduce the targeting error by about 50 percent. But the engineers still weren\'t satisfied.\n\nThen, Wellborn, who was taking over the project, had a brainstorming session with fellow graduate student Richard Hendrick. Among the materials that his predecessor had left behind was a latex bald cap. ""That sparked the idea of caps in general,"" Wellborn recalled. ""We wanted something elastic that was form fitting, which led to the idea of a swim cap.""\n\nIn addition to fitting extremely tightly to the head, the new design had another advantage. The headband system has only three fiducial markers attached on the ends of three thin rods to form a triangle. The new design allowed them to attach several dozen markers directly to the surface of the cap, which the researchers believe will also contribute to improving the guidance system\'s accuracy.\n\nThey designed three tests to determine how well this ""granular jamming cap"" performed relative to the current headband in reducing targeting error:\n\nThey ""bumped"" both them from a number of different directions with a tennis ball filled with plastic particles swinging on the end of a string. They found that the cap reduced targeting errors by 83 percent.\n\nThey simulated the case where a cable or other piece of equipment is accidentally pushed against the two by applying forces ranging from four to six pounds in different directions. They determined that the cap outperformed the headband by 76 percent when the forces were applied to the headband and by 92 percent when they were applied to the markers.\n\nThey tested the effects of head repositioning by having an experienced surgeon reposition test subjects\' heads six to seven times. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.\n\nOn the strength of these results, Vanderbilt University has applied for a patent on the design and the technology is available for licensing. (Interested parties should contact the Vanderbilt Center for Technology Transfer and Commercialization.)\n\n""It\'s a very clever way--that doesn\'t involve drilling holes in patients\' skulls--to greatly improve the accuracy of the guidance system when we are operating in the middle of a person\'s skull: a zone where the accuracy of the current system is inadequate,"" said Russell.\n\n###\n\nStudy coauthors also include graduate student Neal Dillon and former postdoctoral fellows Jessica Burgner, professor engineering at Leibniz University in Hanover, Germany, Ray Lathrop, senior consultant engineer at Eli Lilly and Company, and Raul Wirz, medical imaging processing research scientist/engineer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,\n\nThe research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R01 EB017467 and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship grant 144519.']",The release also omitted costs and limitations of the research.,"This Vanderbilt University news release describes a tight-fitting silicone cap vacuum-packed with coffee grounds that tracks a patient’s head movement during surgery. With the help of a video, it does a good job of explaining how this “granular jamming cap” could improve upon currently used elastic headbands with double-stick tape, which it says are prone to slippage and don’t allow markers to cover the entire head. But costs aren’t addressed, and there are unacknowledged limitations with the research, which was published in March by the International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery. For one thing, the device hasn’t been tested in real surgeries. Further, researchers say coffee isn’t actually suitable for a surgical product because it biodegrades. So the headline’s assertion that “six cups of ground coffee can improve nose, throat surgery” is overblown. We also wish it had clearly explained how reducing head tracking errors could help patients.
The news release coincides with the presentation of the cap design at the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions. It appears to be aimed at drumming up interest in order to attract an investor that could bring this product to market.

In fact, ""many current blood thinners are based on initial experiments from proteins found in snake venom,"" he added.\n\nIn the new study, a team led by Tur-Fu Huang, a pharmacology researcher at National Taiwan University, focused on the venom of the Tropidolaemuswaglerix snake -- a Southeast Asian species known as Wagler\'s pit viper or the Temple viper.\n\nThe snake\'s venom contains a protein called trowaglerix, the researchers explained. Designing a molecule based on trowaglerix, Huang\'s group was able to block GPVI -- a protein that sits on the surface of blood platelet cells and is crucial to allowing these cells to clump together and form clots.\n\nWhen mixed with blood, the new compound prevented blood cells called platelets from clotting. Also, mice that received the drug had slower blood clot formation than untreated mice, but the treated mice did not bleed longer than untreated mice. Still, experiments in animals often don\'t translate to success in humans, so further research is needed.\n\nDr. Kevin Marzo is head of cardiology at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. Reviewing the findings, he agreed that the drug under development may have merit.\n\n""Many of the lifesaving drugs used in the treatment of heart attack patients work by inhibiting platelets and preventing blood clotting. However, it is often at the cost of serious bleeding complications,"" he said.\n\n""The potential development of a new agent based on snake venom that could have similar beneficial effects on preventing blood clotting, and potentially cause less bleeding side effects, is an exciting discovery that warrants future investigation,"" Marzo added.\n\nThe study was published June 8 in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on anti-clotting drugs.']","Less speculation about benefits for humans, and more details about what was actually studied in mice, would have improved this story.","Animal studies can reveal important scientific insights and, when appropriately reported, can provide useful news for a broader audience. But this story about the therapeutic use of a compound derived from viper venom could have done more to temper expectations. While there’s a nod to the “early” stage of the research, the story’s headline and first paragraphs speculate mainly about a treatment for “human heart patients” that would be safer than existing blood-thinners. We’re far from knowing if this will ever be true–and the story could have established that fact sooner and with more emphasis.

Now Western doctors want proof that it works.\n\nThere is little dispute that people feel better after receiving the treatment, in which thin needles are inserted deeply into the skin at specific points on the body. But are they benefiting from acupuncture itself, or just getting a placebo effect?\n\nThe debate was fueled last week by a study in the journal Arthritis Care and Research. Researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston found that among 455 patients with painful knee arthritis, acupuncture delivered no more relief than a sham treatment.\n\nActually, patients got significant pain relief from both treatments — an average reduction of one point on a scale of 1 to 7. And critics contend that the study was poorly designed.\n\nFor one thing, they note, patients in both groups received treatment with needles and electrical stimulation; the main difference was that in the sham group, the needles were not inserted as deeply and the stimulation was far shorter in duration.\n\nIn the real world, however, a trained acupuncturist would customize the treatment to a patient’s specific symptoms. But in this study, the patients in the “real” acupuncture group all received needles inserted in the same way.\n\nRather than proving that acupuncture does not work, in other words, the study may suggest that it works even when administered poorly. But the real lesson, acupuncture supporters say, is how difficult it can be to apply Western research standards to an ancient healing art.\n\n“People argue that there really are no inactive acupuncture points — pretty much wherever you put a needle in the body is an active point,” said Dr. Alex Moroz, a trained acupuncturist who directs the musculoskeletal rehabilitation program at New York University. “There is a body of literature that argues that the whole approach to studying acupuncture doesn’t lend itself to the Western reductionist scientific method.”\n\nBut the study’s lead author, Dr. Maria E. Suarez-Almazor, notes that the sham treatment was developed with the help of trained acupuncturists. In a drug study, an equal response in the treatment and placebo groups would prove the drug does not work, she says.\n\n“We really worked with acupuncturists who are trained in the Chinese traditional style and asked them to come up with a sham that could be credible,” Dr. Suarez-Almazor said. “We didn’t plan a study trying to show that acupuncture didn’t work. The results came out with no difference between the groups.”\n\nThe MD Anderson research and other recent acupuncture studies have fueled speculation that the prick of a needle, whether from real acupuncture or a sham version, can influence the way the body processes and transmits pain signals. A 2007 study of 1,200 back-pain patients, financed by insurance companies in Germany, showed that about half the patients in both real and sham acupuncture groups had less pain after treatment, compared with only 27 percent of those receiving physical therapy or other traditional back care.\n\nWhen the German researchers tracked how much pain medicine the patients used, they detected a noticeable difference between real acupuncture and the sham treatment. Only 15 percent of patients in the acupuncture group required extra pain drugs, compared with 34 percent in the sham group. The group receiving conventional back therapy fared even worse than those receiving fake acupuncture: 59 percent of those patients needed extra pain pills.\n\nThe researchers, who published their findings in Archives of Internal Medicine, speculated that inserting needles in or around an area of pain may have caused a “super placebo” effect, touching off a series of reactions that changed the way the body experienced pain.\n\nStill another study, this one financed by the National Institutes of Health and published in 2004, found that acupuncture significantly reduced pain and improved function in knee arthritis patients compared with a sham treatment or routine knee care.\n\nBut that result has been called into question because the patients in the sham group probably figured out they were not getting the real thing. They received only two needle insertions in the abdomen, while a needle was simply pressed along nine areas of the leg and taped to the skin to mimic acupuncture. A mock electrical stimulation machine whirred and blinked nearby, but didn’t deliver any current to the body.\n\nThis year, researchers at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit solved the problem of creating a sham acupuncture treatment: they didn’t have one. Instead, they compared acupuncture to a proven remedy — the drug Effexor, an antidepressant that has been shown to significantly reduce hot flashes in breast cancer patients.\n\nThe results were striking. Acupuncture relieved hot flashes just as well as Effexor, with fewer side effects. The acupuncture recipients reported more energy and even an increased sex drive, compared with women using Effexor.\n\n“There are some things you can’t study the same way we do with drugs,” said Dr. Eleanor M. Walker, director of breast radiation oncology at the Henry Ford Health System. “The thing that can’t be argued in my study is the duration of the effect. It lasts, and the placebo effect doesn’t last once you stop a treatment.”\n\nBut acupuncture believers say it doesn’t really matter whether Western scientific studies find that the treatment has a strong placebo effect. After all, the goal of what they call integrative medicine, which combines conventional and alternative treatments like acupuncture, is to harness the body’s power to heal itself. It doesn’t matter whether that power is stimulated by a placebo effect or by skillful placement of needles.\n\n“In general in integrative medicine, when patients are involved in their healing process, they have a tendency to do better,” said Angela Johnson, a practitioner of Chinese medicine at Rush Children’s Hospital in Chicago who is conducting a pilot study of acupuncture to relieve pain in children. “I believe that’s part of the reason why they get better.”\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on August 24, 2010, on page D5 of the New York edition of The Times.']",We’re sure that the columnist attempted a fair and balanced examination of the research challenges in this area rather than a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of acupuncture. ,"      


 

 
Let’s be clear:  this is a difficult topic.  But this article provided an overly optimistic view of acupuncture’s therapeutic effects by selectively reporting the results of four clinical trials.  These included two sham-controlled trials on the treatment of chronic knee pain and one sham-controlled trial on the management of chronic back pain.
Curiously, it also included discussion of a small study comparing acupuncture to an antidepressant for hot flashes among breast cancer patients.  By its design, this study wasn’t capable of separating the specific treatment effects of acupuncture from placebo responses. Yet it is presented as if it were relevant to this issue.
The column offered a variety of rationales on why acupuncture might not produce optimal results in conventional, sham-controlled clinical trials. But it didn’t balance out this discussion by considering whether the growing number of trials questioning acupuncture’s treatment impact might simply be correct.
The story included quotes from four researchers or independent experts. However, three of the four appeared to be proponents of acupuncture.
Revising Study Results
An example of the article’s apparent tilt towards acupuncture came in discussion of a recent trial on the treatment of painful knee osteoarthritis from Texas. That study concluded that both acupuncture and sham acupuncture produced identical improvements in pain scores: roughly one point on a seven-point scale (J-MAP).
However, the New York Times article proposed altering that conclusion through sleight-of-hand.  It noted that the patients would have received a different, non-standardized program of acupuncture in the “real world.” And that the study conclusions could be revised to suggest that acupuncture “works even when administered poorly.”  
The columnist didn’t discuss the possibility that acupuncture might actually perform worse in a real-world setting where patients don’t have to meet strict study inclusion criteria. And the article didn’t consider whether a one-point improvement on a seven-point pain scale would be considered evidence that a treatment “works”.
Overall, the article did not provide a clear view of the larger body of evidence on the risks, benefits, availability, or costs of acupuncture for any condition. And it did not adequately stress the key take-home message in this area: that sham-controlled clinical trials have not yet documented that acupuncture has a clinically important treatment effect—and that this is a gaping hole in its evidence base.  (Manheimer et al., 2007; Sherman et al., 2009).

Injections typically cost a fraction of surgery and require much less recuperation time.\n\n\n\n""It\'s taking hold. People are doing (injections) a lot more frequently,"" said John Bull, a plastic surgeon in Naperville. ""People that are looking for a modest improvement with less down time and no scars typically want to have this done. The best candidates are people with early signs of aging and volume loss.""\n\n\n\nLaurette Agee, 51, who is general manager of a McDonald\'s in Aurora, was a patient of Bull\'s. More than four years after losing her husband of 26 years, Agee was ready to come out of her shell but noticed the aging process taking hold.\n\n\n\nShe did not warm to the idea of plastic surgery, so starting in February she began receiving different types of injections in her cheeks, lips and along the sides of her nostrils.\n\n\n\n""I catch men looking at me now in a different perspective. It makes me feel very good,"" Agee said. ""At my son\'s wrestling meets, other moms were like, \'Did you have something done, Laurette? You look so good.\' I have no shame in saying, \'I did this, and this, and this.\'""\n\n\n\nIn the last decade, minimally invasive procedures have skyrocketed in popularity, from 5.5 million performed in 2000 to 11.6 million in 2010 — a 110 percent increase, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The best-known and most commonly used, Botox, jumped 584 percent.\n\n\n\nCosmetic surgical procedures were done 18 percent less often in 2010 than in 2000, with considerably larger drops in facelifts (65 percent), forehead lifts (57 percent), eyelid surgery (36 percent), chin augmentation (55 percent) and nose reshaping (35 percent), the society reports.\n\n\n\nThe new product, called laViv and approved by the Federal Drug Administration in late June, is what Chicago plastic surgeon Julius Few describes as ""another tool in our chest."" It will take awhile to reach market and will be more expensive than other injectables, at least initially, Few said.\n\n\n\n""It\'s not going to be one of these things where people are going to put down their other options like Botox overnight,"" he said. ""As this continues to develop and is modified and enhanced as an application, hopefully it will approach a cost point similar to some of the other options and have a broader application. ... My experience, given past history, is that the concept of using a patient\'s own material and then enriching it is expensive.""\n\n\n\nThomas Mustoe, a plastic surgeon and professor of surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, also expects laViv to be costly and expressed skepticism that it will necessarily work better than other nonsurgical options. He said the FDA approval indicates that the procedure is safe and can work, but patients should not necessarily conclude more.\n\n\n\n""This is certainly significant that you have approval,"" Mustoe said. ""It is going to be simple to inject. But what is unknown is whether it is going to turn out to be better than other fillers. We\'re still sorting out what is possible with a needle and an injection.""\n\n\n\nPart of the reason for the popularity of injectables is the cost. Bull said they typically are no more than half the cost of surgery, which can run from $5,000 to $20,000, depending upon the areas of the face affected and technique used.\n\n\n\nFew said some minimally invasive procedures can cost $3,000 or more. Botox is ""a third or less of that,"" he said, but needs to be redone every three to six months, while other products can last ""on the order of years."" Plastic surgeons have been combining regimens to ""get a result that is better than either (product) alone,"" he said.\n\n\n\nSusan P., 57, a Chicago resident and executive assistant who asked that her last name not be used, has been seeing Few for about four years. He has injected Botox and Restylane around her eyes, the sides of her nose and her forehead, and she estimates she spends about $3,500 per year.\n\n\n\n""There\'s no giveaway that I\'m doing anything, which is really appreciated,"" she said. ""The longer you do this, the less often you have to go. There\'s a cumulative effect.""\n\n\n\nAgee estimates she spent a little less than $2,500 for a combination of Radiesse for her cheeks, Botox around her eyes and Juvederm for the sides of her nostrils. Though initially apprehensive about possible side effects, she said, she\'s more than willing to repeat it.\n\n\n\n""The process was a lot easier than what I anticipated,"" she said. She had worried: ""My God, what happens if I look like a freak? I work in public nine hours a day. I have like 50 employees under me. I\'m going to look like Frankenstein.""\n\n\n\nMustoe said the key to avoiding such results is proper pacing of treatments and not overdoing it.\n\n\n\n""Some patients look overly plumped up. There are limits to what you can do,"" he said. ""You only have to look at the folks in Hollywood to see that a series of (too many) small procedures can have a very strange effect.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Shallow is perhaps the kindest label for this story on a new cosmetic therapy known as laViv. </span>","This story about the rise in the use of injectable products spent most of its space on the product called laViv.  The story does not even name the company – or tell readers where they might get the product.

Not all brain tumors are amenable to conventional surgery, for multiple reasons – such as location in deep parts of the brain with limited surgical access or being adjacent to critical structures. In addition, in some conditions increased risk of morbidity is seen after surgery, like in recurrent tumors with prior radiation or surgery. These patients, especially in the recurrent setting, have limited treatment options.\n\nFocused high-dose radiation like stereotactic radiosurgery is useful in brain metastasis and could be used as initial treatment. However, radiosurgery is not useful for malignant primary brain tumors like gliomas, and even in metastasis it does have variable degree of failure based upon the size of tumor and prescribed radiation dose.\n\nPatients who are suffering from deep seated or recurrent primary brain tumors, as well as those with brain metastases who failed radiation, have limited options and may benefit from alternative treatments like laser ablation.\n\nLaser ablation is a minimally invasive treatment modality for brain tumors that uses laser technology to increase the temperature of tumor and subsequently kill tumor cells. It also might have a role in enhancement of chemotherapy and radiation therapy effects by disruption of repair mechanisms in tumor cells and increase the permeability of blood vessels of brain. Unlike conventional surgery, it doesn’t need extensive surgical exposure. Actually, it works through a small stab incision in the skin and a small hole in the skull.\n\nLaser probe will be inserted using intra-operative navigation, and controlled firing of the laser will cause an increase in the temperature of tumor and eventually destruction of tumor cells. Although this technology has been around for decades, new technical advancements like specific MR-thermometric scans during surgery have an almost real-time measurement of brain temperature and control of the extension of treatment field, which allows the robotic probe driver to change direction and the depth of laser probe during surgery to have complete coverage of the tumor. Plus, a completely newly designed laser probe with a built-in cooling system prevents excessive temperature of the probe during surgery, which has made a resurgence of this treatment modality for intracranial applications in recent years.\n\nSince five years ago, when the NeuroBlate System was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, hundreds of patients with brain tumors who used to be considered inoperable underwent this procedure successfully with promising outcomes. It's especially crucial for patients with brain tumors in difficult-to-access locations, as well as for those who have experienced failure of prior radiation treatment.\n\nBeing a relatively new procedure, NeuroBlate doesn't yet qualify as a standard treatment for brain tumors. However, initial results have been promising, and further studies are on the way.""]","In a display of very questionable editorial decision-making, U.S. News and World Report allows a neurosurgeon to write about a new technology that his institution has a stake in promoting.","An image from the Cleveland Clinic website promoting the NeuroBlate device
As the musical King of Siam might have said, this article is a “puzzlement.” Written more in the style of an opinion piece, and by a neurosurgeon at the Cleveland Clinic whose website states that it was the “first” to test the technology promoted in the text, the story describes a computer-assisted brain tumor ablation platform that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administrative five years ago and was designed to offer life-extending options for those with difficult-to-treat or inoperable malignant brain cancers. The article does a pretty good job of setting out the limited and sometimes terrible therapeutic options such patients face, but the tone overall is promotional and there is no discussion of the costs or harms associated with the device. There is also no “news” context for the article, or answer to the question, “why is this information news now?” No recent clinical trial data are cited, and it appears that the last published clinical trial was in 2013, a phase I study of 10 patients, which saw modest life extension for some patients, along with serious side effects in most, including brain swelling. Without citing specific supportive data, the article states that “hundreds of patients” have undergone successful treatment with the NeuroBlate System. (Interestingly, there is an ongoing retrospective registry sponsored by the company to determine outcomes with no results as yet.) Overall, the information in the piece is accurate with respect to the challenges neurosurgeons and their patients face, but it’s a mystery why U.S. News & World Report (USN&WR) chose to “cover” the topic at this point in time; why a neurosurgeon was chosen to present it as a piece of journalism; and why no other sources were cited that might have updated the information and made it newsworthy.

778,story_reviews_00525,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/optimistic-coverage-of-portable-gluten-test-lacks-some-key-context/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,Portable gluten test promises to ease dining woes,"['Portable gluten tester from 6SensorLabs. 6SensorLabs\n\nRestaurants, office parties, potlucks, meals while traveling -- they\'re a minefield for people with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity who can suffer from stomach pain and upset, swollen joints, and other debilitating health problems when they ingest even a little bit of gluten.\n\nThe maker of a new handheld gluten-detecting device hopes to help make eating outside of a gluten-sensitive individual\'s own kitchen safer and easier.\n\nThe company, 6SensorLabs, has started taking pre-orders for the device it calls Nima, which can test food for gluten and get rapid results, said co-founder and chief technology officer Scott Sundvor.\n\nNima is not FDA-approved and it\'s not intended for medical use, but the company intends it as a ""consumer"" tool to use when dining out, Sundvor said.\n\n""One of the things that we wanted to make sure we distinguish is that we don\'t see ourselves as a medical device,"" Sundvor told CBS News. ""So we do not need FDA clearance for the device because we are not using it to diagnose or manage disease. We\'re simply providing a product to help people know what\'s in their food and guide their habits.""\n\nGluten-free diners can place a sample of food into a capsule or ""test pod"" and then insert the capsule into a black, triangular device that basically acts like a mini chemistry test. In about two minutes, Sundvor said Nima can tell if the food sample has 20 parts per million or more of gluten. A smiley face means it\'s OK; a frowning face means it doesn\'t pass muster.\n\nAs a point of reference, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires manufacturers who choose to put a ""gluten free"" label on food packaging to meet the same 20 parts per million of gluten standard.\n\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. People with celiac disease experience an immune reaction when they eat gluten that can lead to intestinal damage and impact the health of other organs if it\'s not managed well. It can cause stomach pain, a swollen belly, acid reflux, diarrhea, skin problems, and other symptoms.\n\nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that about 1 in 141 Americans has celiac disease, but many people don\'t know they have the condition. Gluten-sensitive people experience similar symptoms to those with celiac disease and improve when they eliminate gluten from their diets.\n\nNima is triangular and relatively dainty, about three and a half inches tall by three inches wide, and a little less than an inch thick. ""Small enough to fit into your pocket along with your keys and mobile phone or a small clutch,"" said Sundvor.\n\nNima was first conceived when Sundvor and company co-founder Shireen Yates met about two years ago and realized they both had gluten intolerance and other food issues.\n\n""We met at MIT through mutual friends. She was getting her MBA and I\'d gotten my engineering degree from there. We had this shared experience; Shireen has several food allergies and I also have several food intolerances. We both just had these issues where we\'d eat out and get sick or feel uncomfortable,"" Sundvor said. ""Shireen had the idea, \'Why can\'t I just test my food and figure out what\'s in it?\' So we started talking about the idea and we researched the market and realized it\'s something we could make happen.""\n\nIt costs $179 to pre-order a tester plus three one-time-use pods, and $47.95 for a refill pack of 12 pods; prices will increase later this month, according to the company\'s website. The company plans to deliver the product by the middle of next year after they\'ve tested it more thoroughly, Sundvor.\n\nMarilyn Grunzweig Geller, chief executive officer of the Celiac Disease Foundation, said she is not familiar with the new gluten-sensing device and was unable to comment on it directly.\n\n""Certainly an FDA-approved device that could help people determine if they were accidentally ingesting gluten could go a long way to helping people and would be useful."" However, she adds, ""I would never comment on a device that\'s not FDA-approved.""\n\nShe said she\'s anecdotally aware of a number of ""treatments"" for celiac disease and has heard of gluten sensors, but is skeptical.\n\nAs for Nima, Sundvor said, ""We\'re doing a huge amount of testing and one thing we want to be sure of before we start shipping is that we\'re 99.9 percent accurate.""\n\nHe said they have received Nima prototypes and he and his girlfriend, who has celiac disease, are already trying it out.\n\nThe company also aims to create similar versions that could test for peanut and dairy allergens, among other problematic ingredients. A Nima app is in the works, too, that he says will let users share information about restaurants and log their results.']",The addition of some crucial context would have made this story feel less promotional and more like an informative piece of journalism.,"This feature story describes a start-up company’s plans to soon begin marketing a pocket-sized device said to quickly detect gluten in any food with “99.9 per cent” accuracy. To its credit, the article makes clear that the device, called Nima, is neither FDA-approved, nor meant to diagnose or manage celiac disease or “gluten intolerance.”  And it goes to some lengths to put gluten-related health problems in perspective and avoid disease mongering, making clear that Nima’s gluten test is designed only to help those dining out test restaurant and party foods for a protein with the potential to make them sick. However, the story offers no quantitative or other evidence for the accuracy of the device; doesn’t discuss harms; and it could have done a better job of noting that the “gluten free” food craze has lured huge numbers of customers with no documented history of celiac disease to buy expensive (and often taste-free) products. The story surprisingly did not mention that the device’s developers had a National Institutes of Health “Innovation” grant (SBIR), and it could also have been strengthened by noting there is at least one other company that claims to also have quick “gluten tests” for sale to consumers, and at a far lower price than the $179 introductory price for Nima mentioned in the piece. A reader (and certainly these reviewers) might also well consider the story premature, given that the company is taking only “pre-orders” for a product it says won’t be available until mid-2016, and that is still being tested.

786,story_reviews_00835,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/magnetic-stimulation-helps-some-people-with-treatment-resistant-depression/,2012-08-03 04:00:00,Magnetic stimulation helps some people with treatment-resistant depression,"[""Back to previous page\n\nMagnetic stimulation helps some people with treatment-resistant depression\n\nBy Julie Appleby,\n\nChristine Curtis of Sterling says she is a “happy mom” again, crediting her recovery from debilitating depression to an expensive treatment that sends magnetic pulses into the brain.\n\n“I can’t put a price on it,” said Curtis, 36, who said she feels better than she has in a decade after completing 30 days of the procedure, called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or rTMS.\n\nAn increasing number of psychiatrists and hospitals — as well as entrepreneurs opening rTMS centers around the country — are betting that there are millions of people like Curtis, discouraged by depression treatments that have proved unsuccessful and willing to pony up thousands of dollars for the possibility of relief. The treatment, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is covered by Medicare in five states, but few private insurers pay for it routinely.\n\nWhile rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. The technique has been shown to work better than a placebo, but the proportion of patients who show complete relief ranges widely, from as few as 10 percent to as many as 57 percent, according to various studies.\n\nThe debate has huge implications, not just for many of the 14 million Americans who suffer from major depression every year but also for businesses eyeing a potentially lucrative market and insurers weighing whether to cover it.\n\nAbout half of those 14 million Americans seek relief through psychotherapy and prescription drug treatment, according to an evaluation by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But studies show that antidepressants provide complete cessation of symptoms only about a third of the time. Magnetic stimulation is aimed at patients with such “treatment-resistant depression.”\n\nSupporters say rTMS is worth the cost — between $6,000 and $12,000 for the four-to-six-week treatment — because it enables people such as Curtis to resume productive lives.\n\nSkeptics question the price tag in light of uncertain benefits.\n\n“The majority of studies that evaluated rTMS failed to find evidence of an enduring treatment effect after the initial response . . . and some . . . failed to find any significant treatment effect,” concluded Health Plan of Nevada, a UnitedHealthcare insurer, which rejected coverage in March.\n\nWith the nation’s health-care spending expected to top $2.7 trillion this year, the battle over paying for rTMS demonstrates why it is so difficult to rein in health-care costs. New technology is generally allowed into the market after studies show it is reasonably safe and more effective than placebos. But that’s not the same as showing it works better than current approaches.\n\nExperts differ over whether it’s smart to cover new techniques if they haven’t proved superior to established methods. And they can also disagree over the medical research itself: Was a study done well? Were there enough patients enrolled? Did it ask the right questions? Insurers often call for more research, while doctors and patients — many desperate for help — warn against delay. And costs are rarely discussed publicly.\n\n‘What did I have to lose?’\n\nIn December, when Curtis first had a magnetic coil placed on her scalp while a $70,000 machine sent pulses into part of her brain, she had already spent a decade trying seven different prescription medications in her battle with depression.\n\nGetting no relief but gaining weight and feeling sluggish and “out of it” because of the drugs’ side effects, she eagerly agreed to the month-long series of five-day-a-week treatments. Most patients have between four and six weeks of near daily sessions.\n\nCurtis’s psychiatrist, Niku Singh, who is also the medical director at TMS NeuroHealth, suggested that she try the procedure. “I was all for it,” said Curtis, whose insurance did not cover the treatment. “It’s a matter of nothing else had worked, so what did I have to lose?”\n\nAs the very first patient treated at the Tysons Corner facility, which opened in December, Curtis paid only $3,000 because the center needed a test patient to meet the requirements of the device manufacturer. The fee is generally about $10,000, but officials say they work with patients who can't afford that. Founders of the center compare rTMS’s potential to that of the now-ubiquitous laser eye clinics; they aim to open a chain of centers nationally that will take walk-ins and accept referrals from physicians. Walk-in patients without a doctor referral would be screened by the center’s medical director to determine if they are in fact appropriate candidates for rTMS treatment.\n\n“We looked at the Lasik model and said, ‘Can we do this with depression? Can we do this with TMS?’” said Bill Leonard, president of the company.\n\nDuring a treatment, a patient sits in a chair like one in a dentist’s office while an electromagnetic coil is placed against her head. The machine sends four seconds of magnetic pulses into the brain in 26-second intervals, making a woodpecker-like tapping noise. The whole procedure takes about 40 minutes and is monitored by a technician. Patients say it does not hurt. Studies have shown that side effects are few and generally minor, such as headaches and scalp irritations.\n\nSingh said rTMS works by having the pulses stimulate a region of the brain that helps control mood; researchers say the pulses help depression by activating the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. (Singh, who owns two psychiatry practices in the region, says he does not have an investment interest in TMS NeuroHealth.)\n\nThe use of rTMS for altering mood or affecting the brain has been studied since at least the early 1990s. After reviewing data from a study of 301 patients, the FDA cleared the device in 2008 for the treatment of major depression in adults who had failed to improve after at least one round of drug therapy.\n\nThat study was funded by the device’s manufacturer, Neuronetics, a company based in Malvern, Pa. It found that up to 17 percent of patients treated with the device for six weeks became symptom-free, about twice as many as those treated with a sham rTMS machine.\n\nSubsequent studies have shown a range of results, with about a third of patients reporting complete relief. One 2010 study of 199 “moderately treatment resistent” patients funded by the National Institute of Mental Health found that rTMS was four times as likely to get patients symptom-free as was a sham procedure. Patients in that study were treated five times a week for three to five weeks. One key measure — known as the “number needed to treat” — found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. Five percent of the patients in the sham group became symptom-free.\n\nSupporters such as those at TMS NeuroHealth say they are seeing better results than that among their patients, who can continue taking antidepressants along with their treatment. Curtis, for example, still takes a daily antidepressant four months after completing her treatment, but she has been able to sharply reduce the dosage.\n\nCurtis said she noticed no change in her depression at the very start of her rTMS treatment, but she began feeling better after about two weeks of treatment. “I’m not up and down anymore,” she said.\n\nFor patients who don’t respond to prescription drugs and talk therapy, the other major option is electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, in which an electrical current is sent through the brain to deliberately cause a seizure. The procedure, which is more widely used than rTMS, requires two to three treatments a week for three to four weeks and is effective for many patients. But it requires anesthesia and sometimes causes memory loss or confusion. rTMS does not require anesthesia, and its side effects are generally mild. A few small studies have looked at its effects on cognitive function and found either no effect or slight improvement, according to the AHRQ analysis. The costs of ECT — typically about $3,300 for four weeks of thrice-weekly treatments, according to AHRQ data — are covered by most private insurers as well as by Medicare and Medicaid. The cost is higher, however, if a patient must be admitted to the hospital.\n\nComparable to drug therapy\n\nLinda Carpenter, an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, who has conducted medical studies using rTMS for depressed patients, says the treatment is effective for some patients, possibly even better than simply trying another medication. But she says questions remain about how long the effects last and how often a patient should return for additional sessions.\n\n“What’s the range of booster treatments people need?” she asks. “Is it once a week, or every couple of years? There’s a huge range in my clinical experience.” Carpenter, a physician, says research has not found any safety issues for patients returning for additional treatments, but cost is a factor.\n\nUncertainty about its long-term effectiveness is why most insurers do not routinely cover rTMS. Medicare also has mainly rejected coverage, though in January, the administrator of the program’s New England region became the first to approve it, citing the AHRQ report and an assessment from an independent regional advisory board.\n\nThat 19-member panel voted 10 to 5 last year that studies of the treatment showed it to be as good as or better than usual care for depression. Six of the 10 said it represented a “reasonable” value for its cost; four saw it as a low value. (The same panel voted 9 to 6 that rTMS’s health benefit was equal to that of ECT.) A similar coverage decision proposal is being considered by the Medicare office serving the Washington region.\n\nEven with limited insurance coverage, about 8,000 patients have had the treatment, and the number of treatment centers has doubled to a total of about 400 nationwise since 2010, according to reports by the device’s maker. Centers include some big names, such as Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\nStill, some are not convinced. “The initial treatment with rTMS is $12,000: That’s a lot of generic Prozac or Effexor,” which are cost-effective antidepressants with long track records, said Joel Rubinstein, associate medical director of Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, an insurer that does not cover rTMS. “Managed care has an obligation to a population. You’re shepherding a fixed amount of resources across a large population and trying to do it according to some sort of evidence-based system.”\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan health policy research and communication organization not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.""]",This was a very thorough assessment of a new technology for treating patients whose depression does not respond to medication. Balanced story that addressed many key issues.,"This Kaiser Health News story published in the Washington Post delivered the core of what we expect from any article about a new treatment approach — a balanced, evidence-based look at how well the treatment works, with appropriate attention to costs and harms. We were pleased to see this appraisal linked to a larger debate about our healthcare system and what it can afford to offer in an era of skyrocketing costs. Kudos for an informative and very readable take on a complicated issue.
There are a few areas where the story might have helped readers more:
– definition of treatment resistant depression (interestingly it has differed from FDA for various treatments)
– give the proportion of depressed patients who have treatment resistant depression
– The AHRQ report cited is a recent systematic review which synthesized all the published literature on this topic.  Other studies cited in this article were single studies.  It would help to start educating readers about the differences in these approaches – and that not all studies are equal.

Rosenfeld, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Miami, said the decision was “clearly a case of pay to play” since Genentech’s money dictated the choice of drugs.\n\nRetinopathy results from damage to the blood vessels in the eye. In macular edema, fluid from those damaged vessels leaks into the macula, the part of the retina that is responsible for the straight-ahead vision important for driving, recognizing faces and reading.\n\nLucentis, also known as ranibizumab, works by drying up leaky blood vessels and preventing the growth of new ones.\n\nJohn Bevan, who has diabetic macular edema, said that every two months or so he used to have an incident in which blood leaked into his eye, blurring his vision.\n\n“It’s like a paintball hits a plate-glass window — there’s a big splat and it drips downward and takes three days to a week to dissipate,” said Mr. Bevan, the school superintendent in north central Indiana.

Three years after receiving two administrations of the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine four weeks apart, all members of a group of adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed an improvement in HbA1c to near normal levels - improvement that persisted for the following five years. The study from a Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) research team - published in npj Vaccines - also reports that the effects of BCG vaccine on blood sugar control appear to depend on a totally novel metabolic mechanism that increases cellular consumption of glucose.\n\n""This is clinical validation of the potential to stably lower blood sugars to near normal levels with a safe vaccine, even in patients with longstanding disease,"" says Denise Faustman, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Immunobiology Laboratory , principal investigator of BCG clinical trials at MGH and senior author of the npj Vaccines report. ""In addition to the clinical outcomes, we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited BCG vaccine doses can make permanent, beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes.""\n\nFaustman will also present five-year follow-up results of a separate group of BCG clinical trial participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes on Saturday, June 23, at the 78th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando.\n\nUsed for almost a century to prevent tuberculosis, BCG has been known for more than 30 years to boost production of a cytokine called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may be beneficial in autoimmune diseases both by eliminating the autoreactive T cells that attack an individual\'s tissues - in the case of type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islets - and by inducing production of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that could prevent an autoimmune reaction. Faustman\'s team first reported in 2001 that inducing TNF production could cure type 1 diabetes in mice, but since TNF dosing is toxic in humans, clinical trials have utilized BCG for its ability to elevate TNF levels safely.\n\nInitial clinical trial results, published in a 2012 PLOS One paper, reported that two doses of BCG spaced four weeks apart led to reductions in autoreactive T cells, an increase in Tregs and what turned out to be a transient increase in insulin production. But by the end of that short, 20-week trial, there was no reduction in HbA1c, the established measure of blood sugar levels over time. An extension and expansion of that trial with long term follow-up, the current results are based on data from 282 human study participants - 52 with type 1 diabetes who participated in the BCG clinical trials and 230 who contributed blood samples for mechanistic studies.\n\nRegular monitoring of clinical trial participants found that HbA1c levels of those receiving BCG had dropped by more than 10 percent at three years after treatment and by more than 18 percent at four years. That reduction was maintained over the next four years, with treated participants having an average HbA1c of 6.65, close to the 6.5 considered the threshold for diabetes diagnosis, and with no reports of severe hypoglycemia. Participants in the placebo group and in a comparison group of patients receiving no treatment experienced consistent HbA1c elevations over the same eight-year time period.\n\nIn investigating how BCG administration produces its beneficial effects, the research team identified a mechanism never previously seen in humans in response to treatment with any drug - a shifting of the process of glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation, the most common pathway by which cells convert glucose into energy, to aerobic glycolysis, a process that involves significantly greater glucose consumption by cells. The researchers also found that BCG could reduce blood sugar elevations in mice that were caused by means other than autoimmune attack, raising the possibility that BCG vaccines could also be beneficial against type 2 diabetes.\n\nMihai G. Netea, PhD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, says of this study, ""The clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system. We know, and this study shows, that BCG vaccination induces epigenetic reprogramming at the chromatin architecture level and functional alterations indicative of a permanent change in immunity. The MGH trials and other, larger prevention and intervention trials underway around the globe may lead to a major shift in the prevention and treatment of infections and autoimmunity."" Netea was not involved in the current study.\n\n###\n\nThe MGH team\'s findings set the stage for further testing of BCG administration, including the FDA-approved phase 2 study currently underway, testing multiple BCG doses in a large group of participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes. That trial is fully enrolled, and there are seven additional BCG clinical trial groups currently recruiting or enrolling at MGH, with a pediatric trial in the planning stages.

A recent paper, Capsaicinoids Enhance Metabolic Rate in Normal Healthy Individuals using a Novel Metabolic Tracker Breezing Device-An Open Label Placebo Controlled Acute Study, published in the journal Obesity Open Access discussed the findings of the Metabolic Rate (MR) Study, which demonstrated that an extract from red hot peppers boosted metabolic rate (Chen, et al., 2017).\n\n""Because capsaicinoids (the component of hot peppers that gives them heat) are hot, it was imperative that we use an ingredient which the subjects could tolerate,"" said Vijaya Juturu, Ph.D., F.A.C.N., one of the lead researchers on the MR Study. ""Since Capsimax is made using a proprietary beadleting technology, OmniBead, which coats the capsicum extract, releasing it only when it reaches the intestines where it is absorbed without discomfort, we were able to deliver beneficial levels of capsaicinoids to our subjects, which made the MR Study possible.""\n\nThe MR Study was a placebo-controlled, crossover open label study with 40 healthy adults examining the effects of either 2 mg capsaicinoids from 100 mg of Capsimax or placebo on resting energy expenditure, heart rate and blood pressure. Resting energy expenditure is the amount of energy required by the body during resting conditions and accounts up to 60% of the calories you burn each day and so increasing this amount can aid in managing weight. The study showed that supplementing with this low dose of Capsimax increased metabolic rate which calculated to an equivalent to burning an extra 116 calories per day. Moreover, though resting energy expenditure varies with each individual, this increase would yield almost 1 lb. of fat lost over 30 days.\n\n""Aging is inevitable, but that doesn\'t mean we can\'t be active participants in our weight management as we age,"" said Abhijit Bhattacharya, President of OmniActive Health Technologies Ltd., producers of Capsimax. ""Capsimax is supported by multiple studies with findings showing safety, increased lipolysis and satiety and improved healthy body composition.

Next, patients can try costlier alternatives such as botox injections, a device called miraDry that delivers electromagnetic energy to decompose sweat glands, or laser therapy to destroy them.\n\nSufferers can also opt for localized surgery, like liposuction, to remove or injure sweat glands. Oral medicines can be used to systemically limit sweating.

Oral Nsaids can be toxic to the kidneys, and they increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. And some, including Vioxx and Bextra, were taken off the market after they were linked to heart attacks and strokes.\n\n“The turning point for topical Nsaids was the fright over heart problems with Vioxx,” Dr. Moore said. “Suddenly there were tons of folks who thought topical Nsaids were a good idea.”\n\nDr. Roy D. Altman, a rheumatology professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the drugs might be especially helpful for “the elderly or those taking multiple medications, who were not getting treated but who can now use topical Nsaids and get some benefit.”\n\n(Dr. Altman has consulted with Novartis, which makes one of the painkillers, Voltaren gel.)\n\nAnother leading pain researcher, Dr. Roger Chou, an associate professor of medicine at Oregon Health and Science University, noted that the skin creams delivered “very high joint concentrations of the topical Nsaid, higher than with standard oral doses, with very low blood levels” — less than 5 percent of those found with oral Nsaids.\n\nIn clinical trials, the skin creams are linked to a higher rate of redness, irritation and rash. And the three topical Nsaids sold in this country — Voltaren gel, the Flector Patch and Pennsaid, a liquid — all contain the Nsaid diclofenac, whose oral version has been linked to liver damage.\n\nThe risks in the most vulnerable population — people with other illnesses, like liver disease, or those on blood thinners — are not known, because these patients are generally excluded from studies.

Aside from the possible risks to people with other illnesses, the drugs are not helpful for patients with pain throughout the body, like fibromyalgia, and should not be used along with oral Nsaids.\n\nNor are they recommended for stress fractures or tendon tears, because anti-inflammatory drugs in general have been shown to slow healing of tendons and bones.\n\nAnd young, healthy patients may not want to bother with creams or gels, which have their maximum effect if applied four times a day. “It’s easier to pop a pill,” Dr. Altman said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut for immediate relief of my tennis-related muscle pull, the cream was handy and helpful.""]","Sometimes the frame can distract from the picture.

This story about topical gels that contain pain relief medication similar to ibuprofen makes a strong showing when examined point-by-point. Nevertheless, readers may end up with a skewed impression because of the personal anecdote and opinion that open and close the story. The headline and lead, as well as the last words of a story, can carry a lot of weight. The meat of the story includes a comprehensive overview of the medical evidence, but then there are phrases such as, “She raved about the stuff” and “for immediate relief of my tennis-related muscle pull, the cream was handy and helpful.” All the careful statements of fact in the body of the story may well be drowned out by the personal comments. 
This story includes something we see too rarely: it points out that much of the available medical evidence comes from clinical trials on ideal patients. These patients have simple problems and aren’t being treated for other serious conditions, and there is little information about how these medications work and what risks they may present to more typical patients, who often are dealing with multiple health conditions and taking several drugs that could interact.

Neither is figuring out the cause of chronic back pain a lot of the time.\n\nBut researchers at Johns Hopkins suggest that a common diagnostic technique doesn\'t help doctors much for patients whose chronic lower back pain appears to be due to arthritis of the joints in the spine.\n\nDoing away with a painkilling injections, or nerve blocks, as a test to determine the root cause of the back pain didn\'t hurt patients who went on to have their pain treated by zapping nerves with electrodes. Skipping the diagnostic nerve blocks can save $10,000 in medical costs.\n\nThe results appear in the August issue of Anesthesiology.\n\nBecause the diagnosis of pain can be imprecise, doctors often order multiple tests before treatment. In doing so, they may weed out patients who would actually benefit from treatment, according to the study. Of about 150 patients, the group that got radiofrequency treatment immediately had more people who felt better.\n\nAlmost everyone suffering from back pain says something like, ""I want to feel better, I want to play golf again, or I want to be able to play baseball with my grandkids,"" anesthesiologist and lead author Steve P. Cohen tells Shots. Patients don\'t care much about the finer points of diagnostic accuracy. They just want relief.\n\nBut some pain experts defend the value of the diagnostic tests. Dr. Nikolai Bogdu at the Newcastle Bone & Joint Institute in Australia told Reuters that further cost analysis is needed to account for millions of patients who might not get pain relief from the radiofrequency treatment.\n\nThe study\'s suggestion on how to manage back pain also runs counter to current guidelines from major medical groups. The American Chronic Pain Association for example says that a block test determines who should get radiofrequency treatment.\n\nCohen, who serves as a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves, tell us he\'s seen immediate treatment work on soldiers, who need to quickly return to their posts, so there\'s no reason why skipping straight to radiofrequency treatment shouldn\'t also work on civilian patients.\n\nDoctors may not change their approach anytime soon, however. For one thing, Cohen says insurance companies typically cover radiofrequency therapy only after a patient has gone through at least one diagnostic test.']","Too short, incomplete and unoriginal.  Lacking in key details about how many are harmed, how many benefit, and – after the diagnostic test in question – how good is the treatment anyway?

No one knows for sure what causes this process to begin, but some research suggests that the initial autoimmunity may begin early in life.\n\nFive immune system autoantibodies have been linked to type 1 diabetes. Having one of these antibodies isn\'t a guarantee that you\'ll develop type 1 diabetes, but it does indicate an increased risk for the disease. People who have two or more type 1 antibodies have between a 50 and 100 percent risk of developing type 1 diabetes, according to background information in the study.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that breastfeeding may offer some protection against the development of these antibodies, possibly because breastfeeding delays the introduction of infant formula, which contains complex proteins. Formula may somehow trigger the development of autoantibodies as these proteins are broken down for digestion.\n\nThe current study was randomized and double-blind (meaning neither the parents nor the researchers knew who was getting what), and compared regular baby formula to one that was made easier for babies to digest because the proteins were broken down (extensively hydrolyzed).\n\nBabies were offered the formula during the first 6 to 8 months of life, any time breastfeeding wasn\'t available. They were then followed till they were about 10 years old, according to the study.\n\nAfter adjusting the data to try to account for the duration of exposure to one of the study formulas, the researchers found that the extensively hydrolyzed formula reduced the risk of having one diabetes autoantibody by 49 percent, and the risk of having two or more autoantibodies by 53 percent.\n\nHow the highly hydrolyzed formula might reduce the risk of developing diabetes-predictive antibodies is unknown, but the researchers speculated that it might contribute to reduced gut permeability or changes in gut microflora, among other things.\n\nAccording to Knip, the take-home message from the study is that ""it is possible to reduce considerably the initiation of the diabetes disease process in at-risk children in a simple and safe way: weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula."" He added that, ""based on the current results, we think that it is justified to recommend weaning to a highly hydrolyzed formula for babies in families with a member affected by type 1 diabetes.""\n\nNot everyone agreed with that notion, however.\n\n""The data in this study is not sufficiently strong to support recommending any changes for parents,"" said the author of an accompanying editorial, Dr. David Harlan, co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center in Worcester.\n\n""I think the authors designed this study to address their hypothesis that proteins present in non-hydrolyzed formula might incite an immune response, and by breaking them down, you might eliminate the immune response. But, there are quite a few steps between that and how the immune system or diabetes are triggered,"" added Harlan\'s editorial co-author, Dr. Mary Lee, a professor of pediatrics and cell biology and chief of the pediatric endocrine division at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center.\n\n""I think this is an important study because we need to understand what causes type 1 diabetes,"" said Harlan, who added the caveat: ""In this study, while there is an apparent signal, there are also some causes for withholding complete faith in the conclusion that the formula caused diabetes.""\n\nBoth Lee and Harlan stressed that there is currently no definitive evidence to suggest that the use of standard cow\'s milk formulas leads to an increased incidence of diabetes compared to breastfeeding. The hydrolyzed formula is also considerably more expensive than standard formula, experts point out.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about type 1 diabetes from the American Diabetes Association.']","Strongest point:  inclusion of several independent experts’ perspectives. Weakest point:  use of only relative, not absolute, risk reduction stats.","There are many options when weaning an infant from breast milk.  The story discusses a recently published NEJM study which compared extensively hydrolyzed formula with regular infant formula in infants from 6-8 months, and followed these children for 10 years.  The more expensive hydrolyzed forumula was associated with fewer cases of  Type 1 diabetes antibodies in children who were at risk of developing the autoimmune disease.  However, the story notes that there is not definitive evidence that choosing regular cow’s milk infant formula will increase the risk of developing Type 1 diabetes, compared to other types of formula.

Sherri Epstein flinches, but Gessler coaxes her to hold out her hands. He places the small animals in her palms, and they skitter in tiny circles, tickling her skin. “Now,” says Gessler. “Which one used to have Canavan disease?”\n\nA few miles away, at Epstein’s home in Worcester, Massachusetts, a young woman lies in bed, her thin limbs bent and still, her curly red hair splayed across a pillow. This is Rachel, Epstein’s 17-year-old daughter, born with Canavan disease—a debilitating, fatal brain disorder. As a newborn, Rachel opened her mouth as if to scream but made no sound. As an infant, she never moved in her sleep. When Rachel failed to lift her head by six months of age, an early intervention therapist suspected she had cerebral palsy. Epstein wishes it had been so. Instead, Rachel had inherited a mutated version of a gene called ASPA from each of her parents. Without a healthy copy of that gene, her cells could not produce a protein needed to break down acid in the brain. So the acid built up, then slowly ate away at the insulation protecting Rachel’s neurons, turning her white matter into a sponge pocketed with fluid-filled sacs. As a result, Rachel does not talk; she cannot see or control her limbs or other bodily functions; she has seizures and will likely not live to adulthood.\n\nThere is no treatment and no cure for Canavan disease. Yet standing in a room at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Epstein holds a mouse that once had the same symptoms as Rachel—but now runs effortlessly over her outstretched fingers. Weeks before, the mouse was treated with a single intravenous injection of a gene therapy drug developed in the lab of Gessler’s doctoral adviser, microbiologist Guangping Gao. The drug is the fruit of Gao’s 23-year career in gene therapy.\n\nTry Newsweek for only $1.25 per week\n\nGao did not always believe the drug would ever make it out of the laboratory, because the field of gene therapy has been plagued with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, including the deaths of test subjects. Over the past five years, however, there has been a resurgence of gene therapy in neuroscience. Scientists now argue it is our best, and perhaps only, chance at curing many diseases of the brain. And attuned to the multibillion-dollar potential of this new class of drugs, large pharmaceutical companies including Novartis, Shire, AstraZeneca and GSK are joining the fray. More than 20 biotech companies are currently developing viral gene therapies while others are working to directly edit genes.\n\n“Gene therapies are coming along fast and furious. They’re going to earn their place,” says Kevin Starr, co-founder of Third Rock Ventures, a venture capital firm invested in three gene therapy companies. “We are probably in the greatest innovative period of understanding human disease and how to make cures ever.”\n\nRobert Seeberg/Agencja Fotograficzna Caro/Alamy\n\nA FedEx Truck to the Brain\n\nThe concept of gene therapy is straightforward, beautiful even: Fix an illness caused by a faulty gene by replacing or supplementing a healthy new copy of the gene. In other words, use genes as medicine. For example, one of the earliest human tests of gene therapy was in 1990, when two young girls with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) received repeated infusions of their own white blood cells modified to fix a defective gene. It worked—with continued treatments, both children showed signs of a restored immune system and went on to lead normal lives.\n\nGao first met a Canavan patient in 1993, at a party celebrating his discovery of the gene and mutations that caused the disorder. A family wheeled over their 6-year-old with Canavan disease to the young scientist, who realized that the boy had donated tissue to his research project. “I’d held his DNA in my hands. I had found what was wrong with his DNA,” recalls Gao, then a Ph.D. student. Yet he had no way to fix it. At that moment, “I knew what I would do for the rest of my life—find a cure for the disease,” says Gao. “And other than gene therapy, there was no other way.”\n\nGene therapy is well-suited for treating inherited brain diseases. First, most drugs can’t get through the brain’s formidable blood-brain barrier, but something small, like a virus with a healthy gene tucked inside, can do it. Additionally, the brain is a closed compartment, so the risks of gene therapy are minimized—other parts of the body, the liver or the lungs, say, are undisturbed.\n\nIn the early ’90s, Gao was a student without a lab of his own. So he sought out James Wilson at the University of Pennsylvania, a rising star in the field of gene therapy. For the next 13 years, Gao would work for Wilson, engineering new and better viruses for the therapies, called “viral vectors.” These molecular FedEx trucks can be loaded with healthy versions of genes and deliver them to the correct location in the body.\n\nGao was in the right place at the right time. By 1999, more than 115 gene therapy clinical trials were approved in the U.S, ranging in illnesses from cancer to blood disorders to graft-versus-host disease. Wilson eagerly moved from the lab into human trials, starting with five studies utilizing a modified version of an adenovirus, a common virus known to cause respiratory infections in people. One of those trials enrolled a teenager named Jesse Gelsinger.\n\nGelsinger suffered from a genetic liver condition kept under control with pills and diet, but he volunteered for the study to help find a cure for infants with a fatal form of his disorder. When Gelsinger received the gene therapy in September 1999, the adenoviral vector triggered a violent immune response that damaged his liver and shut down his lungs. Four days after the injection, he was dead.\n\nHis death shuttered gene therapy funding and research in the United States. Europeans continued on, buoyed by an announcement in 2000 that gene therapy had cured a group of 20 children with SCID. But within a few years, five of them had developed leukemia from the treatment. One died, and scientists fled the field. Gao, who was not directly involved in the clinical trial that led to Gelsinger’s death, doesn’t like to talk about it now, saying only that he doesn’t blame Wilson. Gao kept his head down and quietly continued to work on other types of safer viral vectors.\n\nThe most promising candidate was adeno-associated virus (AAV)—a virus that grows in the presence of adenovirus but is a completely different type. AAVs are not quite as efficient as adenoviruses at getting genes into human cells, but they are much safer: The human immune system barely notices the virus’s outer coat or “dress,” as Gao calls it. And AAVs do not integrate into the genome of human cells, which is what caused leukemia in some of the SCID patients.\n\nIn 2008, Gao struck out on his own, taking a job as director of a brand-new gene therapy center at UMass. The paint on his office walls was still wet when Sherri Epstein walked in. A part-time administrative assistant in the building next door, Epstein had seen Gao’s appointment in a local newspaper. Epstein introduced herself and told Gao about Rachel and her previous attempt at gene therapy. Five years earlier, doctors running the first-ever Canavan gene therapy trial drilled six tiny holes into Rachel’s skull, inserted thin catheters and delivered their drug to parts of her brain. It was safe, but it didn’t work.\n\nBonnie Weller/KRT/Newscom\n\nNot long after that initial meeting, Epstein brought Rachel to visit the lab. Once again, Gao was standing in front of a desperate parent and dying child.\n\nAt the time, only one gene therapy had been commercially approved in the world: a cancer drug in China. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe were highly skeptical of the safety and efficacy of such treatments. Gao knew he had to be careful and was determined to not repeat the errors of his predecessors by rushing into human trials. Instead, he spent the next eight years in the lab, methodically producing a novel gene therapy for Canavan disease. He has spent over $2 million in federal and university research funds developing and testing it in hundreds of mice with the disease.\n\nGessler, a young German scientist studying to be a neurosurgeon, joined the project in 2012 and has since led the optimization of the therapy, narrowing in on the ideal AAV vector to get into the brain—AAV9 won the spot—and an improved gene construct that produces 10 times as many copies of the needed protein as earlier versions. This most recent gene therapy is so good at slipping into the brain that Gessler is able deliver the drug intravenously into the blood, and it passes through the blood-brain barrier to penetrate all areas of the brain. No drilling into the skull required.\n\nGessler will never forget the first time he tested the optimized therapy in a live animal. He injected it into a young, sick mouse, hunched over with no control over its muscles. When Gessler returned to assess the results, he couldn’t find the mouse. He worried he had mislabeled a cage. He hadn’t. The mouse was there, acting just as healthy as the control mice.\n\nToday, the treatment has cured Canavan disease in two different strains of mice engineered to have the disease. A dozen freezers line the long hallway in Gao’s laboratory, each filled to the brim with preserved tissues and viruses. “We have the therapy. We are ready,” says Gao, grinning like a schoolchild. The last barrier is financial but not impossible to overcome. Gao estimates it will require $10 million to $12 million to launch the first human clinical trials—but the potential profits are already attracting biotech attention. Two companies, which Gao declined to name, have approached him about getting involved in the effort.\n\nMaking the Billion-Dollar Bet\n\nThe office of Voyager Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, epitomizes a trendy startup: glass doors, whiteboard walls, minimalist orange-accented décor and a communal area with free drinks and snacks. It smells like caffeine and money.\n\nBut unlike tech startups, this office is flanked on either side by laboratories full of microscopes and viruses. The company is developing gene therapies for a handful of central nervous system disorders, including Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and Lou Gehrig’s disease. Voyager CEO Steven Paul has worked in the pharmaceutical industry developing drugs for brain disorders for over 35 years and witnessed the tribulations of gene therapy. He’s ardent that now is finally the right time.\n\nInvestors agree. Venture firms have invested more in gene therapy since 2010 than they did during the whole previous decade, and therapies for the brain far and away lead the pack, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Last February, when Voyager was just a year old, it inked a deal with Genzyme for $100 million up front and up to $745 million in future milestone payments, including for the company’s severe brain disease programs. Voyager followed that with $60 million in investor financing in April and an $81 million initial public offering in November. Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics, developing gene therapies for rare eye diseases, accumulated $268 million in funding after going public in just two years and scoring a sizable licensing deal with Pfizer. Cambridge-based Bluebird Bio ended last year with a whopping $866 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nIt used to be that Big Pharma wasn’t interested in rare diseases: “Companies thought these markets were too small,” says Paul. But with the right price tag, even a therapy sold to only a few hundred patients can make billions. Glybera, the first European-approved gene therapy, sparked pricing debates when it debuted at $1.4 million per shot. While insurance companies and health care providers struggle to figure out what they are willing and able to recommend and pay for, there’s no doubt a market exists.\n\nGene therapy investments have become so abundant that some academics are turning from government support toward venture capital. R. Jude Samulski, who developed the first AAVs for gene therapy back in the 1980s, recently founded a biotech company in North Carolina, Bamboo Therapeutics, to tap into that revenue stream. It is developing therapies for rare genetic diseases that result in progressive nerve death, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Canavan disease, Friedreich’s ataxia and giant axonal neuropathy. The company expects to begin human trials as soon as next year.\n\nEurope is beginning to see a trickle of gene therapy approvals, including a green light in April for a treatment of type of SCID. The U.S. field waits on an influx of positive clinical data. “Gene therapy will have a product in the U.S. approved by the FDA within two years,” says Gao. “For sure.” That will mostly likely be a treatment for the eyes; this past October, Spark had a Phase III win when a gene therapy to correct an inherited form of blindness successfully restored vision to the “maximum possible benefit” in 21 patients, according to the company. It plans to seek FDA approval for the treatment this year.\n\nBluebird is also in late-stage development of a gene therapy for the Lorenzo’s Oil disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, which, like Canavan’s, targets white matter in the brain. The therapy, Lenti-D, is performed on cells outside of the body: The company removes blood stem cells from bone marrow of a patient, treats them with a gene therapy in a dish, then washes out the virus, tests the gene-modified cells and re-infuses them into the patient’s body.\n\nFor all the recent improvements, gene therapy will not be a cure-all. For instance, the approach is less likely to improve diseases where more than one gene is implicated or the cause is not known. In conditions like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, for example, the approach may lead to symptomatic relief, but not a cure. And the risks have not entirely dissipated. “You always have to think of benefit versus risk with any therapy,” says Paul. “We pick diseases where the risk of not treating is very bad.”\n\nMost children with Canavan disease die before age 10, though some survive into their 20s and 30s. While Gao and Gessler believe their therapy will be most effective in newborn infants who test positive for the mutation, they also can’t forget Rachel and other older Canavan patients. With them in mind, Gessler recently decided to test whether the therapy might also work for older mice. How long could he wait after a mouse had developed the disease to treat and still rescue it? Gessler administered the therapy in sick teenage mice (6 weeks old in human time), adult mice (12 weeks) and mature mice (24 weeks). Then he waited, nervously.\n\nOn a cold, bright day in February, I catch up with Gessler in Gao’s sixth-floor corner office. He is smiling. “We just got the one-year data for the six-week-treated mice,” Gessler says. “They are completely normal.”\n\nAfter meeting with Gessler, I travel an hour north to a pediatric nursing home where Rachel now lives—a utilitarian brick building tucked behind Main Street in a quaint Massachusetts town. Rachel is lying in bed beneath a purple blanket, a unicorn pillow at her feet. An episode of Friends plays in the background.\n\nEpstein is painting Rachel’s nails when I arrive. She adjusts the TV monitor closer to Rachel’s face. “She’s legally blind, but I think she understands everything,” says Epstein. She eventually asks about Gessler’s experiments treating older mice, a hint of hope in her voice. Epstein is not desperate—she has accepted Rachel’s lot in life—but like any parent, she will always desire the best for her child. I tell her about the recent mouse results, and she smiles. The sun outside is setting, and Epstein returns to painting her daughter’s nails, a bright bubble gum pink.']","This well-written story is a captivating read, but needed evidence-based details on the challenges facing researchers in moving gene therapy out of mice studies and into actual interventions.","This in-depth story takes a look at the work of scientists who are trying to repair gene-deficient mice using “gene therapy.” These researchers hope to one day apply these still-experimental treatments to people who suffer from a variety of serious neurological conditions, but the focus in this story is mostly on a rare fatal condition known as Canavan disease.
The heart-rending narratives that dot this account make for vivid reading, and the story does an admirable job of reflecting the hope and enthusiasm of some of the scientists on the front lines of this work. It offers readable explanations of how these researchers are modifying gene delivery strategies to overcome tragic problems uncovered by earlier clinical studies that led to a wholesale halt in work with humans.
But the bottom line here is that nearly all of the promising research of the present has been conducted in mice, making the enthusiasm that permeates this story premature. Instead of deeply discussing the challenges in moving from animal data into medical interventions, the story spends more time on the growing financial interest among investors. The first quote in the story is from a venture capitalist, for example.
While it’s important to discuss the biotech buzz surrounding gene therapy research, it’s also important to provide clarity on how challenging it will be to turn the research into actual treatments, even when experiments are amply funded.

They also looked at questionnaires completed by their mothers to see how much folic acid they were consuming in the month before they became pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, a critical period of embryonic brain development. Health officials in Norway recommend that pregnant women (and women who are trying to get pregnant) take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the 85,176 children in the study, 270 (or 0.32%) received an ASD diagnosis – 114 (0.13%) had autistic disorder, 56 (0.07%) had Asperger syndrome and 100 (0.12%) were diagnosed with “pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified,” or PPD-NOS.\n\nThese children were more likely to be born to women who did not take folic acid. In the raw analysis, mothers who skipped the supplement were more than 2.1 times more likely to have a child with autistic disorder compared with mothers who took the supplement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut not all mothers were equally likely to take folic acid supplements. Those who did were more likely to have attended college, to be nonsmokers, to be first-time mothers and to have planned their pregnancies. The researchers also found that the popularity of folic acid supplements rose as time went on. After the researchers controlled for factors like these, they calculated that taking the supplements was associated with a 39% lower risk of having a child with autistic disorder.\n\nThe raw numbers also showed that women who took extra folic acid were less likely to have kids with Asperger syndrome or PPD-NOS, but when other factors were taken into account, the association was no longer statistically significant and could have been due to chance, the researchers found.\n\nThe results were published in Wednesday’s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.\n\nThe study also looked at folic acid use later in pregnancy but found no correlation between that and the chances of a child developing an autism spectrum disorder. Nor did they find any link between fish oil supplements and risk of ASDs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s unclear how these findings apply to mothers and children in the United States. Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed much more frequently in the U.S. than in Norway.\n\nOn the other hand, pregnant women here are also far more likely to consume a healthy amount of the B vitamin because the Food and Drug Administration has required manufacturers of enriched breads, cereals and other grains to fortify them with folic acid since 1998. As a result, a cup of enriched white long-grain rice now contains 797 micrograms of folic acid, for example, and a cup of Cheerios has 493 mcg, according to this report from the Harvard Women’s Health Watch.\n\nThe fact that autism cases have been on the rise in the U.S. even after folic acid supplementation became mandatory is a puzzle, according to three researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disorders. In an editorial that accompanies the JAMA study, they write that the discrepancy “may be attributable to changes in diagnosis and surveillance but also may reflect a concurrent real increase in the risk of ASDs attributable to as-yet undescribed risk factors and exposures.” They also note that data from the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey published in 2009 show that the typical American consumes only 150 mcg of folic acid per day even with mandatory fortification.\n\nYou can read a summary of the study and the editorial on the JAMA website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReturn to the Booster Shots blog.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @LATkarenkaplan']","Like a Reuters Health story we also reviewed, this story has an enticing headline about an apparent link between folic acid supplements and reduced risk of autism. But it then explains to readers how to put the results in perspective.","This story includes appropriate caution about jumping to conclusions that folic acid can indeed prevent some cases of autism, as well as the size of any potential effect. It does a better job than the Reuters Health story of explaining why a study of women in Norway may not be relevant to women in the US. But the Reuters Health story probably does a better job of telling readers how small the underlying autism risk is in Norway. This LA Times blog post, though, graded slightly better than a CNN blog post on the same study.

Kris-Etherton, PhD, distinguished professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, publish their findings in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nIt is well known that avocados are high in fat, but the majority of an avocado\'s fat is monounsaturated, which is deemed a ""good"" type of fat. It is known that monounsaturated fats can help lower levels of bad cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nFor their study, Kris-Etherton and colleagues set out to assess how avocado consumption - by replacing saturated fatty acids, or ""bad"" fats - affected risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThe team recruited 45 healthy participants aged 21-70 years who were either obese or overweight.\n\nEvery participant was required to follow each of three cholesterol-lowering diets for 5 weeks. The diets consisted of a lower-fat diet without avocado, a moderate-fat diet without avocado or a moderate-fat diet with one Hass avocado a day.\n\nPrior to starting each diet, subjects ate what the researchers deem an ""average American diet,"" which was made up of 34% of calories from fat, 16% from protein, while around half of calories were from carbohydrates.\n\nFrom both of the moderate-fat diets, participants gained 34% of calories from fat, of which 17% were from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs.\n\nModerate-fat diet with one avocado a day lowered \'bad\' cholesterol by 13.5 mg/dL\n\nThe researchers found that participants\' levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - referred to as the ""bad"" cholesterol - were an average of 8.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) lower after following the lower-fat diet without an avocado and 7.4 mg/dL lower after following the moderate-fat diet without an avocado, compared with their baseline average.\n\nHowever, after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, their LDL levels were found to be an average of 13.5 mg/dL lower than their baseline average.\n\nWhat is more, the team found that a number of additional blood measurements - such as total cholesterol, small dense LDL, triglycerides and non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein) - were better after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, compared with the other two diets.\n\nAlthough these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. ""That is not the real-world,"" says Kris-Etherton, ""so it is a proof-of-concept investigation.""\n\nStill, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. Kris-Etherton adds:\n\n""We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats. In the United States avocados are not a mainstream food yet, and they can be expensive, especially at certain times of the year. Also, most people do not really know how to incorporate them in their diet except for making guacamole. But guacamole is typically eaten with corn chips, which are high in calories and sodium. Avocados, however, can also be eaten with salads, vegetables, sandwiches, lean protein foods (like chicken or fish) or even whole.""\n\nIt should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study.\n\nIn January 2014, Medical News Today reported on a study suggesting that consuming half an avocado with lunch each day may satisfy hunger in overweight individuals and help with weight management.\n\nOur Knowledge Center article on the health benefits of avocado reveals some of the other ways the food may be good for us, as well as the potential risks of avocado consumption.']", ,"This story does a reasonably good job of describing what happened in this study about the LDL-lowering effect of avocados. But that’s mainly thanks to an American Heart Association press release upon which the article is largely based. The story doesn’t provide any of the context that might have been gleaned from an actual conversation with the study researchers or an outside independent expert. And perhaps as a result, it fails to provide the broad perspective on what the findings mean in terms of outcomes that matter to people — things like heart attacks and strokes.

(TSE:6501, “Hitachi”) today announced that Johns Hopkins Medicine has selected Hitachi to provide its proton beam therapy (PBT) system at Sibley Memorial Hospital located in Washington, D.C. This collaboration, which includes a 10-year maintenance service, marks the first multi-room PBT application in the nation’s capital. This will be Hitachi’s fifth PBT system in North America.\n\nThe next-generation system “PROBEAT”, which comes with IMPT (Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy) and cone-beam CT, will have improved spot scanning capability in all 3 gantry-type treatment rooms, along with a fixed irradiation room dedicated to cancer research.\n\nToshiaki Higashihara, President & COO of Hitachi, Ltd. stated that, “We are greatly honored that Johns Hopkins selected Hitachi as their proton partner. As one of the leaders in cancer research and treatment, the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center’s philosophy of being at the leading edge of cancer treatment through research and development is very similar to our Social Innovation concept which supports a healthy and secure society through innovative technologies, systems, solutions and services. The proton center at Sibley Memorial Hospital will be an impressive demonstration of industry and academic medicine collaborating to bring a new technology and new cancer treatment modality to Washington, D.C. and the surrounding communities. Thus, we foresee an exciting, long term relationship that will benefit cancer patients and cancer research.”\n\nIn December 2007, Hitachi was the first company in the U.S. to clear FDA Premarket Notification Special 510(k) for the “PROBEAT” system with its spot scanning irradiation technology. Hitachi has delivered the first hospital based spot scanning system in May 2008 and has treated over 1,500 patients to date. The same spot scanning system has already been installed at Nagoya Proton Therapy Center and Hokkaido University in Japan. In fiscal year 2015 (ending March 2016), one of Hitachi's new PBT site is planning to start treatment of patients. Hitachi has shown great stability in the proton market through continued investment in research and development, track record for high clinical availability of over 98%, along with a commitment to a long term partnership with all of its clients.\n\nGiven the growing demand for technical and clinical advancements in the treatment of cancer, interest in proton therapy is on the rise, with more and more hospitals and cancer treatment facilities venturing into this area. Hitachi will continue to globally expand the healthcare business where proton therapy is its flagship solution, and contribute to cancer treatment around the world.\n\nOverview of Proton Beam Therapy\n\nProton Beam Therapy (PBT) is an advanced type of cancer radiotherapy. Protons from a hydrogen atom are extracted and accelerated up to 70% the speed of light. Its energy is concentrated directly on the tumor while avoiding radiation dose to the surrounding healthy tissues. PBT improves the quality of life for cancer patients since the patient experiences no pain during treatment and the procedure has very few side effects compared with that of traditional radiotherapy. In most cases, patients can continue with their normal daily activities while undergoing treatment. Because there are fewer side effects, PBT is expected to expand, especially for pediatric treatment.\n\nOverview of Spot Scanning Technology\n\nUnlike conventional scattering technology, spot scanning technology delivers narrow beams to the tumor and the complex tumor shape can be irradiated through repetitive beam delivery with quick position change. Spot scanning technology has been achieved by advancing the uniform quality beam extraction technology from the accelerator and beam control technology with high accuracy. Three primary benefits are: (1) more accurate irradiation which reduces the side effects to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor compared with irradiation from conventional double scattering irradiation; (2) patient-specific collimators and boluses become obsolete, shortening set up times for patients; and (3) high proton beam usage factor reducing unnecessary secondary radiation.\n\nAbout Hitachi, Ltd.\n\nHitachi, Ltd. (TSE: 6501), headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, delivers innovations that answer society’s challenges with our talented team and proven experience in global markets. The company’s consolidated revenues for fiscal 2014 (ended March 31, 2015) totaled 9,761 billion yen ($81.3 billion). Hitachi is focusing more than ever on the Social Innovation Business, which includes power & infrastructure systems, information & telecommunication systems, construction machinery, high functional materials & components, automotive systems, healthcare and others. For more information on Hitachi, please visit the company's website at http://www.hitachi.com.""]","Being the first “multi-room” proton therapy center in Washington, DC is not much of a distinction.","This news release from Hitachi Ltd. describes the company’s sale of a proton beam therapy (PBT) system to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, DC, a Johns Hopkins affiliate. PBT is a radiation treatment that uses protons instead of x-rays to treat cancer. At high energy, protons can destroy cancer cells. Hitachi’s claim that the sale of a PBT system to Sibley Hospital represents the first such system in the region must be challenged. The lack of information regarding the cost of the new installation, and negligible mention of the evidence and comparative advantages over existing radiation treatments also beg scrutiny.
As noted previously on HealthNewsReview.org, the capital region has become a hub in the “medical arms race,” with Sibley Memorial Hospital, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, and the University of Maryland all investing hundreds of millions in PBT. So Hitachi’s attempt to distinguish this facility by calling it a “multi-room” center is spin. Each major facility can cost $150 to $200 million to build. Many experts question the necessity of these investments in technology that have not been proven to be better than existing and less expensive cancer therapies for the most common types of cancer, and that well-endowed medical institutions are getting a lop-sided share of high tech medical investment while hospitals that serve poorer patients are fighting to acquire standard technology.

As I swerve left to avoid a miniature iceberg, a red fish flashes at the top of my screen. I\'m supposed to tap all the red fish that pop up, but not the green fish or the blue. And I have to do this without crashing the car.\n\nAn unidentifiable, omnipresent game-meister says: ""Doing one thing at a time is easy, but doing them both at the same time is where the magic happens!""\n\nAs I get better at the game, my brain is being trained to ignore distractions and stay focused — or, at least, that\'s the hypothesis of the neuroscientists who designed it.\n\nThe brain networks that control multitasking overlap with networks that control working memory and attention span. So some scientists believe that by playing this game — Project Evo — you can improve a range of cognitive skills and, by extension, relieve a range of symptoms associated with cognitive disorders.\n\n""We\'ve been through eight or nine completed clinical trials, in all cognitive disorders: ADHD, autism, depression,"" says Matt Omernick, executive creative director at Akili, the Northern California startup that\'s developing the game.\n\nOmernick worked at Lucas Arts for years, making Star Wars games, where players attack their enemies with light sabers. Now, he\'s working on Project Evo. It\'s a total switch in mission, from dreaming up best-sellers for the commercial market to designing games to treat mental health conditions.\n\n""The qualities of a good video game, things that hook you, what makes the brain — snap — engage and go, could be a perfect vessel for actually delivering medicine,"" he says.\n\nIn fact, the creators believe their game will be so effective it might one day reduce or replace the drugs kids take for ADHD. But this kind of goal requires a totally different business model; before they can deliver their game to players, they first have to go through the Food and Drug Administration — the FDA.\n\n""The first time those three letters were uttered in a group setting, everyone\'s like, \'Oooo, that\'s scary, do we want to do that?\' "" Omernick recalls.\n\nSilicon Valley companies routinely avoid government regulation if at all possible; the process for FDA approval can be slow and expensive.\n\n""If it says \'FDA approval needed\' in the business plan, I myself scream in fear and run away,"" says Tim Chang, managing director at Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm. He has never backed a company that wanted to go through the FDA.\n\nMost startups can bring a new video game to market in six months. Going through the FDA approval process for medical devices could take three or four years — and cost millions of dollars.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Akili Courtesy of Akili\n\n""That\'s what\'s been scary about going the regulatory path,"" Chang says. ""You\'re waiting and waiting and waiting for FDA approval, going through all these different clinical tests, and you could run out of money easily before you get through that.""\n\nThe worst fear is that the technology will become outdated by the time the FDA process is complete. Tech companies are constantly redesigning their software to keep up with competition and consumer habits. Chang says in four years a game could be obsolete.\n\n""It\'s really out of sync with the way we think of product iteration,"" he says. ""We\'re more on the order of days and real-time changes, where you\'re pushing out app updates every week.""\n\nOn the other hand, Chang admits that going the regulatory route could really pay off. If the FDA gives its stamp of approval, doctors could prescribe the game. And that opens the door for insurance companies to pay for it.\n\n""Then you\'re going into the land of the big, big budgets,"" Chang says.\n\nWithin in the health care field, some executives believe the commercial successes of online games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush could translate into the medical world. They see the potential of these games to not only make money — but to save money, too.\n\n""When you look at the percentage of individuals that are playing video games [59 percent] and overlay that with the percentage of individuals that have chronic conditions or need some assistance from the medical perspective [45 percent], the relationship is pretty strong,"" says Willis Gee, director of information technology strategy and innovation at health insurer Cigna.\n\nOn one level, it\'s about competition. The Affordable Care Act has made it a lot easier for people to switch health plans. Cigna has to find ways to stand out.\n\n""People want to do things that are fun,"" says Gee. ""So, we have to be there with them.""\n\nIt might seem like a strange vision for an industry known best for issuing denial letters. But Gee believes reimbursing patients to play games could cut other health costs — by promoting exercise and preventing disease, for example, or even reducing the amount of expensive drugs people take.\n\n""As an industry, we\'re going to have to reorient ourselves around what it is we\'re really trying to do,"" he says. ""And if, at the end of the day, the goal is about improving health, then we may need to revisit the way we are quantifying outcomes.""\n\nDrug companies are keeping an eye on these games, too. Pfizer partnered with the Project Evo team to see if the game could help improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer\'s disease. The drug manufacturer believes it could alleviate some of the problems with drug trials — helping to make them faster, cheaper and more efficient.\n\nRight now, screening for Alzheimer\'s is subjective. Patients and families fill out forms on mood and attention. The results are often inaccurate. Some of the people recruited for drug trials end up not having Alzheimer\'s at all. Dr. Michael Ehlers, Pfizer\'s chief scientific officer for neuroscience, says Project Evo could help them identify better candidates more quickly.\n\n""I\'d like to think we could cut down standard clinical trials, in size and length of time, by half or more,"" he says.\n\nIn terms of the game replacing drugs someday, though, Ehlers isn\'t so sure.

The focus of the story is primarily on the standards that should be used to evaluate and regulate such video games, rather than the evidence, or lack thereof, that this sort of game could have therapeutic value. Nevertheless, the story passes along several claims about these games that lead the reader to believe that there will be some discussion of the evidence that backs them. But apart from a skeptical comment toward the end and a link to previous story addressing the issue, the hoped-for analysis doesn’t materialize. Which is not to suggest that the story doesn’t deliver a significant amount of valuable information. Readers are treated to the perspective of a number of different players in the technology, health care, and drug industries — and what they have to say about the regulation of such possible therapies is fascinating. Among the interesting questions raised: Can the years-long FDA approval process keep up with a technology that’s changing every six months?

But there\'s growing debate about which mothers-to-be should have a gland in their neck tested, too.\n\nNumerous studies since 1999 have found that an underactive thyroid can raise a woman\'s risk of miscarriage, premature birth, or a lower IQ for her baby — even if it\'s so mildly sluggish that she feels no symptoms.\n\nThe problem: While serious cases are treated with a hormone pill, so far there\'s little evidence that treating the milder cases makes a difference. So guidelines about who should be tested vary widely.\n\nNow a peek at prenatal testing from one of the country\'s largest medical labs suggests that nearly a quarter of pregnant women are getting the simple thyroid blood test regardless of whether they have symptoms.\n\nResearchers at Quest Diagnostics examined records for half a million pregnant women. Of those who got tested, a higher-than-expected number — 15 percent — had an underactive thyroid. That\'s five-fold higher than some previous estimates, partly because the way in which the condition is diagnosed has changed recently, says the study published by the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.\n\nThe vast majority of those women were in the gray zone, with milder cases where no one knows for sure if a diagnosis helps or wastes money on testing and thyroid medication.\n\nThe finding adds pressure for science to settle this long-running controversy.\n\n""We still don\'t have perfect answers,"" says Dr. Elizabeth Pearce, a well-known endocrinologist at Boston Medical Center, where a recent survey found widespread prenatal thyroid testing. But, ""if it\'s my patient in my office, or it\'s me or my family member, I\'m going to treat every time.""\n\nObstetricians seem more wary.\n\n""There are studies on both sides of the fence,"" says Dr. Dena Goffman of New York\'s Montefiore Medical Center, which tests only women at high risk. ""If you don\'t know what to do with the results, you probably shouldn\'t order the test,"" she said.\n\nThe unassuming thyroid — a small bow tie-shaped gland nestled in the front of the neck — plays a big role in good health for everyone. It produces hormones that regulate metabolism and can affect almost every type of tissue in the body. About 20 million Americans are estimated to have a malfunctioning thyroid that, if serious enough, can contribute to heart disease, bone-thinning osteoporosis and infertility.\n\nAn overactive thyroid, called hyperthyroidism, speeds up bodily functions, causing such symptoms as weight loss, nervousness, anxiety and increased heart rate and vision problems.\n\nMuch more common is an underactive thyroid, called hypothyroidism. It slows body functions, causing such problems as fatigue, weight gain, depression, constipation and dry skin. It even can contribute to high cholesterol, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThyroid problems increase with age, but they affect far more women than men — and pregnancy puts extra stress on the gland.\n\nHaving enough thyroid hormones is important for fetal brain development, especially during the first trimester, when the fetus depends solely on the mother for them. The hormones also play a role in avoiding miscarriage or premature birth.\n\nMothers also may harbor immune system cells called antibodies that subtly attack the gland and likewise are linked to miscarriage and prematurity. Italian researchers found that treating those women lowered their risk of encountering this problem.\n\nThere is broad agreement that women with overt hypothyroidism — a seriously underactive gland — should be treated, most likely given a once-a-day hormone pill long known to be safe in pregnancy. But it takes blood testing to diagnose overt disease because even those women don\'t always report the vague symptoms.\n\nThose $25 blood tests are sure to uncover women with mild hypothyroidism, too, the people in the so-called gray zone. Some research has raised questions about whether mild cases really pose a pregnancy risk, and preliminary results from a large British study recently found no overall IQ benefit to the resulting children if their mothers had been treated.\n\nBut the damage might already have been done by the time treatment began late in the first trimester, notes Boston\'s Pearce. In the U.S., doctors are anxiously awaiting a similar National Institutes of Health study; results aren\'t expected until 2015.\n\nWhat\'s the advice until then? The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends testing only pregnant women who have thyroid symptoms, have had previous thyroid problems, or have similar autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes — those considered at risk for overt disease.\n\nThe American Thyroid Association goes further. Last summer it advised also testing all pregnant women age 30 and older, and those with enlarged thyroids, previous pregnancy problems or those who are obese, says Pearce, who co-authored the guidelines.\n\nMost guidelines cite the lack of evidence for treating mild cases. The thyroid association does urge treatment if those women harbor the worrisome antibodies.\n\nA final tip: Pregnant women should check that their prenatal vitamins contain iodine, important for proper thyroid function, Pearce says. Not all do. Most Americans get enough iodine from dairy products, bread, seafood and iodized table salt. But women need extra during pregnancy.\n\n———\n\nEDITOR\'S NOTE — Lauran Neergaard covers health and medical issues for The Associated Press in Washington.']","Overall, the story does an excellent job weighing the pros and cons of thyroid screening and treatment in pregnant women.","The article gives extensive context to the recent Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism study and refers to other research done in the field.

So miserable that some parents are buying $30 shampoos and other washes that promise to ward off the tiny, grayish bugs.\n\nThe parents get peace of mind that they are doing something. Conveniently for the product makers, there\'s no way to tell if they kept lice at bay, or if children wouldn\'t have gotten lice anyway. Makers say sales are growing fast.\n\nNo one tracks the number of head-lice infestations nationwide. The most recent estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1997, says six million to 12 million children ages 3 to 12 get lice each year, though some experts say the incidence rate is much lower. Still, most U.S. school districts report at least one head-lice case a year.\n\nJennifer Crocker is worried her two daughters, ages 7 and 11, could get head lice. Three classes at their elementary school have reported outbreaks of the tiny critters so far this school year. A friend\'s daughter has already gotten them twice.\n\nThe head louse, pictured, prefers a clean scalp and only spreads by head-to-head contact. Some \'super lice\' have evolved to resist chemical treatments to kill them. Getty Images\n\nSo Ms. Crocker, a 42-year-old, stay-at home mother from Oakville, Wash., makes sure her daughters\' hair gets lathered every other day with Rosemary Repel shampoo and conditioner, which maker Fairy Tales Hair Care Inc. claims prevents the bugs from nestling onto kids\' heads.\n\n""My kids are bug-free"" after three years of shampooing and conditioning, she says.\n\nContrary to popular belief, head lice like clean, not dirty, scalps. The wingless bugs can\'t hop, jump or fly—they can only crawl. They spread solely by direct head-to-head contact. They don\'t harm children, but they are awfully itchy.\n\nWhen kids do get lice, beating off the infestation isn\'t easy. So-called super lice have grown resistant to the chemicals in traditional treatments. Parents may use over-the-counter shampoos or creams, prescription treatments containing pesticides, or visit salons that comb hair and pick out the nits.\n\nZippity Doo\'s Styling Gel for Children ($9.99) contains lemongrass, Tea Tree oil and other plant-based ingredients. Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel ($11.95) is sold at salons. Lice Shield shampoo and conditioner ($6-$17) contains extracts of citronella, eucalyptus, rosemary and lemongrass. F. Martin Ramin for The Wall Street Journal Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nSales of prescription lice treatments—used once the bugs have taken hold—rose to $73.8 million last year, up 15% from 2006, according to research firm IMS Health Inc. Sales of over-the-counter lice treatments—which include preventive and removal products—grew 11% over the past five years to $78.9 million for the year ended Nov. 27, according to Chicago-based market researcher SymphonyIRI Group, whose figures don\'t include Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\n\nFairy Tales Hair Care sells shampoos, conditioners and bottled lice repellent sprays through its website and at beauty retailers and hair salons. The company, based in Passaic, N.J., says ingredients such as rosemary, citronella and tea tree oils coat hair follicles, repelling lice.\n\n""Rosemary is really the first line of defense against head lice,"" says Fairy Tales founder Risa Barash, who launched the company in 1999 out of a salon for children owned by a relative. ""It\'s proven. It\'s safe.""\n\nMs. Barash cites a 2004 study published in the Israel Medical Association Journal showing citronella—an ingredient in Fairy Tale products—repels head lice. Previous research, also done in Israel, showed lice avoided tufts of hair immersed in essential oils like citronella, rosemary and eucalyptus.\n\nIf the products didn\'t work, ""why would we have such a large following of repeat customers?,"" Ms. Barash says.\n\nMs. Barash says sales of its items, which range from $11 to $30 a bottle, have risen 36% year-to-date, thanks in part to a new salon distribution deal reached with cosmetics titan L\'Oreal SA at the start of this year.\n\nBabo Botanicals\' Rosemary Tea Tree Lice Repel Shampoo ($15.95) is one of several products promising to fend off lice with rosemary and other organic ingredients. F. Martin Ramin for The Wall Street Journal\n\nLornamead Inc.\'s Lice Shield leave-in spray and combined shampoo and conditioner products are sold nationally by Wal-Mart, CVS Caremark Corp. and Rite Aid Corp. Zippity Doo\'s, a division of Laurus Enterprises LLC, sells its shampoos, hair gels and spray at some U.S. drugstore chains and through the websites of Target Corp. and Walgreen Co. The company declined to specify figures, but says 2011 sales have so far quadrupled last year\'s total. Newer entrants like Babo Botanicals LLC, Happyheads Services LLC and So Cozy Hair Care for Children LLC sell their products at hair salons across the country.\n\nTerri Pitts, a 42-year-old branding consultant in New York City, has used most of the Fairy Tale products over the past year on her five-year-old daughter. She likens lice prevention to wearing a bike helmet. It\'s a ""no brainer,"" she says. ""Why should a kid miss school because of head lice?""\n\nSome public-health experts and school nursing groups are skeptical about the lice-prevention products, citing a lack of formal evidence. The National Association of School Nurses says in a position paper to its members that, based on several research pediatric, dermatology and nursing journal articles, the preventive products have presented ""little scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness.""\n\n""There are lots of things that work in the lab, but not in the field,"" says John Clark, a University of Massachusetts professor of veterinary and animal sciences.\n\nRichard Pollack, an entomology instructor and insect expert at the Harvard School of Public Health, estimates that only about 200,000 elementary-school students actually get head lice each year, rather than the six to 12 million children from the CDC\'s 1997 estimates. In an email, a CDC spokeswoman said its figures were based on sales of head-lice treatments, noting a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics published last year that said the totals were most likely an overestimation.\n\nMost louse diagnosis is wrong, with dandruff or food crumbs confused for nits or eggs, Mr. Pollack says. He says he is skeptical that the lice-prevention products are any more effective than regular shampoos or conditioners.\n\n""These companies might as well claim that their products repel alligators,"" he says.\n\nThe only surefire way to tell if a child has lice is to spot one of the crawling critters, say experts, who recommend parents frequently check their children\'s scalps and comb their hair weekly. Girls can wear their hair up and tight.\n\nNancy Polanco turned to the Internet after receiving a letter about a lice outbreak at her 7-year-old daughter\'s school. She found Zippity Doo\'s website and started using its leave-in conditioner, shampoo and protective spray. She blogged about her experience, saying lice ""don\'t like the smell"" of the preventive shampoos ""and are less likely to stick around."" The posts have drawn more than 2,400 hits, with more readers each day, says Ms. Polanco, a 27-year-old nursing assistant from Windsor, Ontario.\n\nWrite to Timothy W. Martin at timothy.martin@wsj.com']",The money quote in this story: “These companies might as well claim that their products repel alligators.”,"Excellent piece, putting the “problem” of head lice in perspective and raising questions about efficacy of preventive shampoos.
One company spokeswoman asks, if the products didn’t work, “why would we have such a large following of repeat customers?”
The story clearly asks that same question, citing lack of evidence to show that perhaps the answer is:  fear and lack of consumer information. We don’t know which children are simply not exposed to lice and would not get them anyway.

Not so long ago, in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that allergenic foods be kept away from infants until they were at least a year old, and often older. That warning was especially strong for those with a family history of allergies. But, as an editorial published in the same issue of JAMA points out, in the next decade, food allergy prevalence nearly doubled in the United States.\n\nThat advice has been amended, and newer evidence has shown that introducing foods earlier is actually better for preventing food allergies. The authors of the just-published study reviewed all of the available evidence on the topic and included 146 studies in their final analysis.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThey found evidence of “moderate certainty” that introducing peanuts early, between ages 4 and 11 months, is linked to a reduction in the risk of developing a peanut allergy. Eggs, too, showed this association when they were introduced between ages 4 and 6 months. Early introduction of another common allergen, fish, was also linked to less allergy—possibly due to the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3s—though evidence for this link wasn’t as certain.\n\nEarly introduction didn’t seem to make a difference for autoimmune diseases, at least according to the available evidence; eating gluten young wasn’t associated with the risk of developing celiac disease.\n\nExactly why is a question researchers are still exploring. “It is not clear that it is the specific early introduction of an allergenic food that renders immunological protection, rather than the accompanying increased diversity in the diet that occurs as a by-product,” writes Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, an allergy and immunology specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, in the accompanying editorial. More research is necessary to figure out the ideal amounts of these allergens, the optimum times of introduction and the reasons behind the link.\n\nWrite to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com.']",Both the story’s headline and overall brevity make the evidence sound much stronger than what was reported in the evidence review.,"This is a brief story looking at a systematic review of 146 other studies, concluding that there is likely some reduction in risk of allergy to eggs and peanuts if infants get those foods for the first time between 4-6 months, instead of later.
The review lends more evidence to the theory that some allergies can be avoided, paradoxically, by exposing children earlier to the allergen, such as peanuts or eggs. But this is not the final word, and the researchers make that clear in their review, stating, “these systematic review findings should not automatically lead to new recommendations to feed egg and peanut to all infants.”
This viewpoint is missing from the TIME story, which headlined this story with a very conclusive statement: “Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies.”

The new blood tests identify the presence and amount of specific antibodies reacting to the toxins.\n\n""Having an early diagnosis means patients can avoid years of invasive tests and visits to specialists that often leave them with more questions than answers,"" he said. ""With these new blood tests, many patients will now be able to proceed right to therapy for their condition.""\n\nIBS is the most common gastroenterological disorder in the United States, affecting nearly 40 million people. An estimated 10 percent of the world\'s population suffers from the condition.\n\nThe disorder, nearly impossible to diagnose until now, is characterized by a cluster of confounding symptoms that include chronic bloating, abdominal pain, gas, and bouts of relentless diarrhea, constipation, or both. Fatigue and the stress of trying to plan one\'s life around visits to the bathroom can be debilitating.\n\nA multicenter study validating the accuracy of the new blood tests, ""Development and Validation of a Biomarker for Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Human Subjects,"" was published this week in the journal PLOS ONE. Pimentel will also present the research on Sunday, May 17th, at Digestive Disease Week 2015 in Washington, D.C.\n\nPimentel and fellow researchers studied nearly 3,000 people, comparing IBS patients to those diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and those with no GI disease. The blood tests identified the two antibodies associated with IBS -- anti-Cdtb and anti-vinculin -- with greater than 90 percent certainty.\n\nThe tests are marketed under the name IBSchek™ and are produced by Commonwealth Laboratories Inc., in Salem, Massachusetts.\n\n""Most IBS patients have been told at one time or another that the disease was psychological, all in their head,"" said Pimentel.

The rosy description provided belies some big questions about how useful this test really is.","Image from ibschek.com
The release states that two “simple” new blood tests can be used to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by detecting antibodies that signal the presence of toxins that can cause IBS. This diagnosis, in turn, would allow patients to receive treatment more quickly. But the release has many problems that start with the headline, which claims there is now a “definitive” test for IBS. That’s an exaggeration, as the findings need further validation and they apply only to a subset of patients with diarrhea as their main symptom — something the release never explains. The release also glosses over some significant points — such as the fact that there were only 43 control patients (too small a group to draw “definitive” conclusions), and that there’s no evidence that treating patients based on these test results will actually improve their outcomes. The cost of the test and its potential harms — e.g. false-positive results that lead to unnecessary or misguided treatment — also aren’t explored in any way.

Currently, guidelines reserve breast MRI screening for women who have a strong family history or other specific breast cancer risk factors. MRI screening has not been considered necessary for women at average risk, and there has been resistance to expansion of MRI into this population due, in part, to concern over higher costs.\n\nHowever, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study\'s lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, Dr. Kuhl and colleagues studied breast MRI\'s impact on 2,120 women, ages 40 to 70, with less than a 15 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer. The women had normal screening mammograms and, in the case of those with dense breast tissue, normal screening ultrasound. Breast MRI detected 60 additional breast cancers, including 40 invasive cancers, for an overall supplemental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1,000 women. Of the 60 cancers detected in the study group over the observation period (7,007 screening rounds), 59 were found only using MRI, one was found also by mammography, and none by mammography or ultrasound alone.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, the results suggest that MRI can serve as a useful supplemental screening tool for women at average risk, especially those with dense mammographic tissue, and that MRI is superior to supplemental ultrasound for this purpose.\n\nThe results also highlight the ability of MRI in the detection of more aggressive types of cancer.\n\n""The faster a cancer grows and the better it is in seeding metastases, the better will it be picked up early by MRI,"" Dr. Kuhl said. ""In our cohort, cancers found by MRI alone exhibited features of rapid growth at pathology.""\n\nThis ability is especially important in women with dense breast tissue in which aggressive cancers may be missed on mammography. Left undetected, these cancers will grow to become clinically palpable cancers, also known as interval cancers. The new study showed that, consistent with previous research, breast MRI can depict these rapidly growing cancers with high reliability.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kuhl, interval cancers exhibit an adverse biologic profile and are the main driver of breast cancer mortality. Additional cancers detected by MRI screening in the study had a skewed distribution towards a higher-than-normal prevalence or incidence of rapidly growing (grade 3) cancers.\n\n""The interval cancer rate in our study was zero percent. Not a single cancer was undetected that became palpable,"" she said. ""This suggests that MRI finds breast cancers that also mammography would find, but MRI detects them earlier, and it finds the cancers which, if MRI had not been done, would have progressed to interval cancers.""\n\n###\n\n""Supplemental Breast MR Imaging Screening of Women with Average Risk of Breast Cancer."" Collaborating with Dr. Kuhl were Kevin Strobel, M.D., Heribert Bieling, M.Sc., Claudia Leutner, M.D., Hans H.

In particular, the release makes a compelling case for why current practices in breast cancer screening may be lacking, establishes the novelty of the research and presents the hypothesis that MRI screenings are helpful to women with average risk for breast cancer — and not just those at high risk. It’s a hypothesis that now needs to be confirmed.
These positives are offset, however, by a few unanswered questions. First, it is unclear what average risk really means. Digging through the study’s inclusion criteria, we found that the subjects were women aged 40–70 with “a calculated lifetime breast cancer risk of 6%–12% according to the Gail model.” Those percentages are probably not what the average reader has in mind when she hears “average risk.” Second, there is no mention of the specificity (the ability of the test to correctly rule out those without the disease) of MRI screening for average risk women. Lack of specificity can lead to false positives, which have been a concern with MRI screening. Knowing only the sensitivity (the ability of the test to correctly identify people who have the disease) does not allow us to see the complete picture.
This news release scored well on several of our criteria. For a discussion of another news releases on MRI screening for breast cancer that wouldn’t have scored as well, see a related post.

Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said market expectations had been for a mid-to-high teens percent reduction in complications.\n\nThere was also concern that Victoza did not appear to lower heart risks in American patients monitored in the study, despite doing so in other parts of the world and producing a solid result globally.\n\nNovo, the world’s biggest diabetes company, had said in March that Victoza cut heart risks “significantly” in the study but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed on Monday.\n\nResearchers told the American Diabetes Association’s (ADA) annual meeting that 13.0 percent of patients on Victoza died from cardiovascular causes or suffered non-fatal heart attacks or strokes, against 14.9 percent of those on placebo.\n\nDeaths from heart disease were 22 percent lower in the Victoza group.\n\nThe Jardiance trial last year showed a similar 14 percent overall relative risk reduction and a 38 percent reduction in cardiovascular deaths.\n\nThe Victoza trial, known as Leader, had been designed to show Novo’s drug did not increase heart risk, so its superiority is welcome news for the company, especially as Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) rival Lyxumia failed to show heart benefits in an earlier test.\n\nVictoza, which had sales of $2.7 billion last year, is the biggest seller in a class of drugs known as GLP-1 analogues that stimulate insulin production.\n\n“I think physicians will look to GLP-1s with greater enthusiasm,” Buse said in an interview.\n\nOnce-daily Victoza is typically prescribed as a third or fourth option after patients have first tried various oral medicines.\n\n“The significance of this is that now we can start to change the conversation around diabetes management from one of ‘let’s manage your blood sugar’ to one of ‘let’s manage your risk of complications’,” Buse said.\n\nMads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Novo’s chief science officer, said the results should encourage doctors to use Victoza earlier, since they could now see it offered “life-expanding” treatment.\n\nThe findings, which involved following 9,340 patients for a median 3.8 years, were also published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nGastrointestinal upset was the biggest side effect with Victoza. There were fewer cases of pancreatitis, which has been viewed as a potential problem, but more cases of pancreatic cancer, although the difference was not statistically significant.\n\nSince 2008, U.S. regulators have demanded studies for new diabetes medicines to show there is no increase in heart risk, opening a new battleground between different treatments. Lilly is conducting a similar large study to try and prove the heart benefits of its once-weekly GLP-1 drug Trulicity.\n\nThe Leader study was funded by Novo and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.']",This investor-focused story does a mostly solid job of covering the findings from a new trial looking at heart risk reductions from a type 2 diabetes drug.,"The story reports on findings from a clinical trial of Novo Nordisk’s diabetes drug Victoza published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial was designed to measure whether Victoza (generic name liraglutide), which is given by injection, was any less likely than standard diabetes care to lead to severe cardiovascular events like heart attacks or strokes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Along with reporting the key outcomes of the trial, the story quotes the lead scientist involved in the study saying that diabetes treatment can begin to move from managing blood sugar levels to managing the disease’s complications.
The importance of finding drugs to manage cardiovascular health in diabetes is made clear, and the story does a good job of contextualizing the significance of the results, comparing Victoza’s performance to rival diabetes drugs and highlighting that the results, although positive, were not as impressive as some pharmaceutical industry observers had hoped.
The story would have been stronger if it had mentioned the costs of Victoza, and included independent expert commentary, especially to contextualize the lead scientist’s claims that drugs like Victoza may herald a “shift” in how diabetes is managed.

Research presented today at the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine’s (AOSSM) Annual Meeting in Colorado Springs, CO, demonstrated that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation lowered the re-injury risks and need for follow-up surgery when compared to those who were initially treated non-operatively and experienced a repeat dislocation prior to surgery.\n\nThe study examined 121 patients at an average of 51 months post-surgery. Of this group, 68 patients had experienced their first dislocation, while 53 had recurrent dislocations after being initially treated non-operatively. After treatment with an arthroscopic bankart repair, the postoperative dislocation rate in the first-time injury group was 29%, compared to 62% in those who did not have surgery after their initial injury. The average age of patients was 19 years old.\n\n“Deciding between a non-operative program or going forward with surgery can be a challenging decision for medical professionals treating shoulder injuries in young athletes,” noted the study’s lead author Tyler J. Marshall, MD, from Alabama Ortho Spine and Sports in Birmingham, AL. “However, this study shows a substantial benefit for athletes undergoing surgery to prevent recurrent instability down the road.”\n\nThe research data was collected between 2003 and 2013 from eight fellowship trained surgical practices, with patient ages ranging from 16 to 30 years old. Surveys given to patients during follow-ups asked for information such as test for shoulder functionality, whether patients returned to sport, postoperative instability events, and if further surgery was required on the shoulder.\n\n“While young athletes and parents may be wary of surgery, our study shows the advantages of this treatment approach,” commented Marshall. “Physicians should counsel those with first time injuries on these benefits moving forward.”\n\n###\n\nThe American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) is a global leader in orthopaedic sports medicine education, research, communication and fellowship, and includes national and international sports medicine leaders. The Society works closely with many other sports medicine specialists, including athletic trainers, physical therapists, family physicians, and others to improve the identification, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of sports injuries. AOSSM is also a founding partner of the STOP Sports Injuries campaign to prevent overuse and traumatic injuries in kids']",The study findings were based on a retrospective chart review and follow-up survey of how student athletes fared after surgery for a first-time shoulder dislocation. Results in these types of studies are not as definitive as randomized controlled trials.,"This news release describes the results of a study presented at an annual meeting showing that athletes who dislocated their shoulders for the first time and underwent surgery had lower rates of postoperative instability and re-operation when compared with patients who had recurrent dislocations before undergoing surgery.
It contains lots of numbers, which we applaud.
These numbers are important because they add to the limited database available to help guide treatment for athletes who have suffered a shoulder dislocation. As one study put it in 2014, “there is no consensus on the optimal treatment of in-season athletes with anterior shoulder instability, and limited data are available to guide return to play.”
But, in stating a causal relationship, the news release goes beyond what the data support. Specifically, the news release says that the study “demonstrated that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation lowered the re-injury risks and need for follow-up surgery when compared to those who were initially treated non-operatively and experienced a repeat dislocation prior to surgery.” The study, which was observational in nature, can only show associations between shoulder surgery and subsequent outcomes — not that surgery after a first-time dislocation was the cause of reduced risks. Also missing from the release: harms, alternative therapies, costs and study limitations.

The lifetime risk of suffering symptomatic knee OA is estimated to be 44.7% and approximately 1 in 11 of the US population is diagnosed with symptomatic knee OA by age 60. With this knowledge, the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) has released a new scientific statement that provides guidance for physicians and healthcare professionals who provide care for those patients with knee osteoarthritis.\n\nThere is a general consensus that the initial management of knee OA treatment should include weight loss and strengthening exercises. However, certain aspects of treatment for knee OA are controversial. In light of these issues, the AMSSM convened an expert writing group of four sports medicine physicians to review the latest data and provide recommendations for the sports medicine community.\n\n“We do not treat groups of people we treat individuals,” said Dr. Thomas Trojian, Lead Author and Past AMSSM Board of Director. “It is important to look at how a person responds to a medication. Does the person improve if given an injection of viscosupplementation more likely than placebo or intra-articular steroid? Using a network meta-analysis we are able to compare the multiple studies done on viscosupplementation and have found that people are more likely to show clinical improvement with viscosupplementation over placebo (saline) and intra-articular steroids. This is different than studies recently published that say the average response differs.” The full report, published ahead of print in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicince (CJSM) and will appear in the (British Journal of Sports Medicine) BJSM, entitled, AMSSM Scientific Statement Concerning Viscosupplementation Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis Importance for Individual Patient Outcomes, includes the following notable AMSSM recommendations and one suggestion:\n\n• AMSSM RECOMMENDS viscosupplementation injections for Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade II-III knee osteoarthritis in those patients above the age of 60 based on HIGH quality evidence demonstrating benefit using OMERACT-OARSI Responder Rating but the evidence should be downgraded due to indirectness for those under 60 years of age.• AMSSM SUGGESTS viscosupplementation injections for knee osteoarthritis for those under the age of 60 based on MODERATE quality evidence due to response of treatment in those over 60.• AMSSM RECOMMENDS clinicians and researchers collect OMERACT-OARSI responder data to track individual response to the viscosupplementation.\n\nThe full paper will be published in print in the January 2016 issues of CJSM and BJSM.\n\nClick here to view statement online.\n\nThanks to members Drs.

As an added bonus, it makes the recommendation prior to publication of its data.","This news release from the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) describes a therapy called viscosupplementation that involves injecting hyaluronic acid, a gel-like fluid, that acts as a lubricant to alleviate pain in people with knee osteoarthritis. In this case the target audience is senior citizens.
Because the subhead of the release describes it as a “New Scientific Statement” the ASSM might be forgiven for the medical jargon used throughout the release. This clearly wasn’t written for the general public. For example, the release doesn’t explain the term “viscosupplementation,” which is what this release is promoting. We hope health journalists take care when re-interpreting the language for the older Americans considering their many options for treating a common ailment like painful knees.
The release offers no discussion on costs of viscosupplementation or insurance coverage restrictions. The benefit data is limited and there are no mention of harms. The article upon which this recommendation is based won’t be published until January 2016 which makes these limitations much more critical.

That’s not quite the advice doctors are wont to give. But it might make at least a sliver of sense.\n\nCherry pie contains the same sort of anti-inflammatory compounds as aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — at least the cherries do. They’re tart, or sour, cherries, which, as far as is known, contain more of these anti-inflammatory compounds than any other food, says Dr. Kerry Kuehl, assistant director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.\n\nKuehl is a coauthor of a new study suggesting that tart cherries could someday provide an alternative treatment for patients with inflammatory osteoarthritis who can’t tolerate the standard drug therapy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParticipants in the study — presented at the American College of Sports Medicine Conference in San Francisco in May —- were 20 women, 40 to 70 years old, who had all been diagnosed with inflammatory osteoarthritis and had experienced joint swelling at least once in the last year. Twice a day, half of the women drank 10.5 fluid ounces of tart cherry juice. The other half drank that much fake cherry juice with the same calorie content, flavor and consistency.\n\nAfter three weeks, the women who got the real stuff had significantly less inflammation, as measured by C-reactive protein in their blood, than those who had been drinking the counterfeit.\n\nThe anti-inflammatory powers of tart cherries can make them a smart choice for healthy people too. In a number of studies, athletes who drank tart cherry juice before running a race or doing intensive strength exercises felt less pain afterward and bounced back faster than those who didn’t.\n\nBut tart cherries aren’t just loaded with wham-bam anti-inflammatories. They’re chockablock with antioxidants. And a 2011 study in the European Journal of Nutrition suggests that drinking tart cherry juice during the day may pay off in better snoozing at night, thanks to high levels of the sleep-regulating antioxidant melatonin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese studies have been done with people, but other promising research has only been done with lab animals so far. In one 2009 study in the Journal of Medicinal Food, tart cherries helped fat rats. Not our favorite role models perhaps, but the obese beasties’ risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease were reduced significantly, and parallel studies are now in the works with members of our own species, says lead author E. Mitchell Seymour: “There are some interesting and potentially exciting results on the horizon. Stay tuned.”\n\nSo, what’s not to like about tart cherries? Not much ... except for maybe the “tart” part. Let’s just say, the cherry topping off your hot fudge sundae is not a tart cherry. The alluring cherries in the produce aisle are not tart cherries. And those cherries that a happy life is supposedly just a bowl of? They’re not tart cherries either.\n\n“Tart cherries are extremely bitter raw,” Kuehl admits. “Unpalatable.”\n\nBut hey! There is a solution: Don’t eat tart cherries raw. Eat them dried or frozen (in smoothies) or drink them in juice. Even unsweetened, something about juicing makes them taste better, Kuehl says. “Some people really like it.”\n\nAnd, of course, you can always bake a pie.\n\nhealth@latimes.com']",Really?  Reporting on a study of 20 women followed for just 3 weeks – from an abstract presented two months ago?  Why?,"This was an easy story to read:  well-written and engaging.  But there was no meat – just a dessert-like cherry topping of tidbits of a potpourri of a recent abstract from a conference and past research on cherries and purported health benefits.

In addition, the mammoth, U.S.-government funded Women\'s Health Initiative (WHI) earlier found no negative link between calcium and heart health.\n\nBut, as the current authors point out, more than half of the women in that study were already taking their own calcium supplements on top of what they had been prescribed for the trial, which may have clouded the results.\n\nFor this analysis, the authors looked only at the 16,718 women in the WHI who had not been taking personal calcium supplements before entering the trial.\n\nIn this case, women who were randomized to take calcium and vitamin D as part of the study protocol had a modest 13 to 22 percent increased risk of cardiovascular problems, particularly heart attacks. Women in the control arm had no change in risk.\n\nThe case against calcium became stronger when researchers added in data from 13 other, unpublished trials involving almost 30,000 women. Now the increased risk for heart attack was 25 to 30 percent and, for a stroke, 15 to 20 percent.\n\nWhile the authors speculate that an increased risk could be biologically plausible given that calcium is connected with hardening of the arteries, another expert thinks not.\n\nWhile calcium does tend to be a marker of inflammation, explained Dr. Philip Houck, assistant professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine, ""lesions with calcium are actually more stable so there\'s less of a chance of having a heart attack than in vessels that are less calcified.""\n\nMoreover, the results may have been statistically significant but that doesn\'t mean they\'re clinically significant, he added. ""If women have good reason to take calcium because their bones are thin, then they should not be afraid of taking the calcium,"" said Houck, who is also a cardiologist with Scott & White in Temple, Texas.\n\nDr. Susan V. Bukata, associate professor of orthopaedic surgery at the University of Rochester Medical Center, said that the study really doesn\'t provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nNevertheless, accumulating evidence has her urging patients to get their calcium from their diet, rather than reflexively telling them to take 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. ""With diet plus a supplement combined, women should be getting 1,000- to 1,500-milligrams a day,"" she said.\n\nAnd in an accompanying journal editorial, medical professors Dr. Bo Abrahamsen and Dr. Opinder Sahota wrote that due to study limitations, ""it is not possible to provide reassurance that calcium supplements given with vitamin D do not cause adverse cardiovascular events or to link them with certainty to increased cardiovascular risk. Clearly further studies are needed and the debate remains ongoing.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Osteoporosis Foundation has more on osteoporosis.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""> This story makes a good effort to neatly summarize the growing body of evidence around the relationship between calcium and heart health.</span>","It’s a difficult task given the sheer volume of research and the differences between the studies in question.

We would have liked to have seen more of the evidence presented in absolute terms, though, to help readers understand the significance of the findings.

There have been other articles [stating] that alcohol might be protective,"" said Dr. Guy Fiocco, assistant professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine and director of rheumatology at Scott & White in Temple, Texas. ""[But] I don\'t think we\'re going to be advocating alcohol to prevent rheumatoid arthritis.""\n\nNor do the study authors advise drinking as a cure for arthritis. ""We would wish to point out that, at the moment, that our findings are preliminary, and would not recommend that patients drink alcohol with the specific purpose of treating their arthritis,"" said Dr. James Maxwell, lead author of the study and a consultant rheumatologist at The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust in England.\n\n""We would also remind patients to observe recommended government limits for alcohol consumption,"" he added.\n\nAccording to background information in the study, published online July 28 in Rheumatology, previous studies were mostly conducted in mice. The benefit of ethanol exposure for these rodents seemed to be due to higher levels of testosterone, the researchers wrote.\n\nFor this study, the authors compared 1,004 healthy participants to 873 people with rheumatoid arthritis. Both of those groups were divided into four groups: nondrinkers, those who drank 1 to 5 days a month, the ones who drank 6 to 10 days a month, and those who drank more frequently.\n\n""We found that arthritis was progressively less severe as alcohol frequency increased, with a definite difference compared to nondrinkers even in the least frequent alcohol consumption group,"" Maxwell said.\n\nThe teetotalers had quadruple the risk of having rheumatoid arthritis compared with those who drank in the highest category.\n\nAnd the more often one drank, the less damaging the rheumatoid arthritis tended to be, including healthier joints as shown on X-rays and less inflammation.\n\nThe association was seen in both men and women, though it was stronger in males.\n\nAlthough no one can pinpoint a reason for the link with certainty, ""essentially we think that alcohol may be having an effect by reducing the immune response, which leads to joint inflammation, and also that it may have a mild pain-killing effect,"" said Maxwell.\n\n""There\'s a little information that alcohol can suppress the immune system,"" added Fiocco. ""What\'s been reported is that people who drink excessive alcohol actually have higher levels of the cytokines that lead to the inflammation and moderate amounts of alcohol actually may lower these levels.""\n\nThis finding is slightly different than what is reported in the current study (that the severity of the disease decreased with more alcohol).\n\nBecause the researchers assessed drinking frequency, rather than the amount of alcohol consumed, it is not clear how much alcohol might be helpful, they said.\n\nAnd Maxwell stressed that their preliminary findings need to be replicated in the future.\n\n""There are limitations to any research which asks patients to report their exposure to something (such as alcohol) over a period of time,"" Maxwell added. ""We would therefore recommend that a future prospective study should be performed to further assess the impact of alcohol consumption on rheumatoid arthritis, a study recording alcohol consumption at the time rather than asking about it later.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases has more on rheumatoid arthritis.']","Despite repeated cautions from the authors of the study that their findings were preliminary and not the basis for a recommendation, the story framed the findings with positive, causal, action verbs such as ""could help thwart…may help keep…may also protect.""  Listen to the authors.  If they aren’t hyping it, why must you?

Despite a similar number of reported cases of breast cancer among African-American and European-American women, African-Americans experience a more aggressive clinical course and a 40 percent higher death rate than European-Americans among premenopausal and menopausal breast cancer patients.\n\nRecurrent breast cancer has hindered the successful management of this disease for decades and is one of the primary factors for the racial disparity in prognosis and outcomes. Differences in recurrence rates and patterns between the races following various forms of treatment have not been thoroughly investigated.\n\nThis is the first clinical study to suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (treatment prior to surgery) may improve breast cancer recurrence rates and patterns in African-Americans. The results are published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nResearchers at Georgia State analyzed clinical data from a large cohort of breast cancer patients treated at Northside Hospital in Atlanta from 2005 to 2015.

The researchers studied rates and patterns of tumor recurrence after hormone, radiation and chemotherapy among African-American and European-American breast cancer patients.\n\n""We found that, in general, African-American breast cancer patients exhibit increased likelihood for tumor recurrence, particularly to regional and distant sites, after receiving any combination of adjuvant therapy (treatment following surgery) compared to European-American breast cancer patients. This higher incidence of tumor recurrence can contribute to a poorer prognosis,"" said Nikita Wright, first author of the study and a senior Ph.D. student in Dr. Ritu Aneja\'s laboratory in Georgia State\'s Biology Department.\n\nWhen breast cancer recurs, it is more challenging to treat regional and distant tumors than local tumors (in the breast), Wright explained.\n\n""Interestingly, we found that neoadjuvant chemotherapy actually reversed these recurrence trends,"" Wright said. ""We found that African-American breast cancer patients responded better to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than European-American patients. Among patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, African-Americans exhibited trends of lower regional and distant tumor recurrence than European-Americans, but higher local recurrence, which is easier to manage clinically and is associated with a relatively better prognosis.""\n\n###\n\nThe researchers also found that among early stage patients (noninvasive or minimally invasive breast cancer), African-Americans displayed higher tumor recurrence than European-American patients.\n\nCo-authors of the study include Jun Xia, Sergey Klimov, Pranay Neema, Dr. Dora Il\'yasova, Dr. Padmashree C. G. Rida, Dr. Remus Osan and Dr. Aneja of Georgia State; Dr. Guilherme Cantuaria and Dr. Mildred Jones of the Northside Hospital Cancer Institute; Dr. Uma Krishnamurti, Dr. Xiaoxian (Bill) Li and Dr. Michelle D. Reid of Emory University; and Dr. Meenakshi Gupta of West Georgia Hospitals.\n\nThe study was funded by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health.']","Should readers make treatment decisions based on results from only 49 women, when the study these women participated in had 10,504 patients?","This news release from Georgia State University describes some findings from a 10-year data review of African- and European-American women with breast cancer. Surprisingly, the data indicated for the first time that African-American women may benefit more from receiving what’s known as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which means receiving chemo before surgery, which is not the typical order of treatments given to patients. It then explains this may lead to new treatment options that are more effective for African-American women, who have higher recurrence and lower survival rates compared to white women.
The news release left out some big details. The fact that recurrence of breast cancers in all patients was very low — 225 recurrences total (49 of which were African-American) out of 10,504 patient records studied — deserved some discussion in the release. Because of the relatively few women who received treatment in this way, the statistical significance was diminished. The news release should have better elucidated that, explaining these findings are essentially preliminary and more research is needed to see if this bears out in a clinical trial where more factors can be controlled.

When inflamed, discs press against nearby nerves. People with this condition can experience pain, numbness, and weakness in the back, buttocks, and legs.\n\nNone of the people in this study had been helped by other nonsurgical therapies, and supporters say the new therapy could become a standard treatment for such patients. But a back pain specialist who spoke to WebMD says that further research is needed.\n\nIn the study, 119 people (37%) reported no pain at six months. About another third reported less frequent episodes of low back pain, ""maybe once a day,"" says researcher Thomas Lehnert, MD, an assistant professor of radiology at Frankfurt University in Germany.\n\nAnother 22% reported only a little improvement, with pain persisting. And 7% had no improvement or their pain got worse. A few patients resorted to back surgery.\n\nStill, ozone therapy could even help many patients with unrelenting back pain to avoid surgery, Lehnert tells WebMD. Before the treatment, patients had tried everything without success and were considering an operation, he says.\n\nStudies suggest that ozone therapy works by reducing inflammation, shrinking herniated discs, and relieving pressure on the nerves bringing pain signals to the brain. The steroid further reduces inflammation.\n\nLehnert presented the findings here at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.']","Although this story didn’t explain that the study couldn’t answer whether the ozone experimental outcomes are as good as those with a steroid injection or surgery, it nonetheless allowed supporters early in the story to claim this “could become a standard treatment.”  That bold statement should have been addressed more directly.","The story presents the results of a trial examining outcomes of patients with a disc herniation treated with a spinal injection of ozone and steroids. Because the story describes results presented at a meeting, it lacks details that are important to assess the quality of the study. Patients in this study had symptoms that weren’t improving with conservative treatment and were thought to be candidates for a steroid injection or surgery. Instead, they received a single injection of a combination of ozone gas and steroids. Six month outcomes are described – about a third had complete pain relief, another third had partial pain relief, 20% had little pain relief and 7% had no pain relief or were worse. Though promising, these results may be no better and possibly worse than steroid injections alone and probably worse than for surgery.

Uslaner is director of In Vivo Pharmacology at Merck & Co., which funded the study.\n\nMerck already has one such drug, suvorexant, under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nMore than 30 million Americans struggle to get a good night\'s sleep, and about one-third of these use drugs to help the process, the study authors pointed out.\n\nBut widely prescribed sleep medications such as Ambien (zolpidem) and Lunesta (eszopiclone) can leave people feeling hung over and inattentive the next day. So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day.\n\nLunesta and Ambien affect GABA receptors, which are found throughout the brain and are associated with side effects, including thinking disturbances, and deficits in attention and memory, explained Uslaner.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, scientists discovered chemical messengers known as orexins, which are released by a relatively small brain region known as the lateral hypothalamus. This area of the brain releases orexins during the day to keep us awake and lowers levels at night so we can sleep.\n\nThe appeal of orexin antagonists, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, is that they ""target a system that\'s more specific for sleep.""\n\nThat means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained.\n\nUslaner and his colleagues investigated a compound called DORA-22, which has the same mechanism of action as suvorexant, to see how it fared alongside not only Ambien and Lunesta but also diazepam (Valium) in rats and rhesus monkeys.\n\nDORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo.\n\nIn each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. DORA-22 promoted sleep at lower doses than those that impaired mental skills when compared with the ""control"" drugs.\n\nThis is the first time in years that scientists have targeted a totally different receptor in the quest to combat insomnia, said Dr. Alexandre Abreu, co-director of the UHealth Sleep Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\nBut many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Will they be habit forming? And will they change the quality of sleep in any way?\n\nThose questions will only be answered with more testing and use in humans, he said.\n\nExperts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on insomnia.']",The lead says new type of drug helps people sleep without next-day grogginess. But the experiment did not include people (just animals) and didn’t measure next-day grogginess (just midnight memory tests).,"Readers aren’t told until deep in this story that researchers were experimenting on rats and monkeys, not people. It does provide more independent perspective than the Reuters story we also reviewed. Both stories report that the research was done by the company seeking FDA approval for a new sleeping pill. We are puzzled that neither story asked why the important questions about drug side effects apparently weren’t answered by the human clinical trials done to support Merck’s FDA application of a similar drug.

The Ohio State University, Northern Arizona University and Arizona State University researchers found a parallel between behavioral symptoms of autism and gastrointestinal distress, and improvements to both after fecal transplant.\n\n“Transplants are working for people with other gastrointestinal problems,” lead study author Ann Gregory, a microbiology graduate student at The Ohio state University, said in a news release. “And, with autism, gastrointestinal symptoms are often severe, so we thought this could be potentially valuable.\n\nThe researchers built off of previous findings that children with autism typically have fewer types of important bacteria in their guts and less bacterial diversity overall. The research team surmises the disparity is due to antibiotics prescribed within the first three years of life.\n\nThe study, which was published in the journal Microbiome, included 18 children with autism and moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems. The children ranged from 7 to 16 years old. A questionnaire was used to assess social skills, irritability, hyperactivity and communication. Parents and doctors reported improvements that lasted at least eight weeks after treatment. Children without autism were used as a control for the study, the news release reported.\n\nOn average, the score on a scale for ranking gastrointestinal symptoms dropped 82 percent from the beginning to the end of treatment, while average developmental age increased by 1.4 years, according to the release. Researchers also asked the children’s doctors to perform pre- and post-diagnostic evaluations, which suggested lasting benefits.\n\nOne of the study’s limitations is its small size, and researchers cautioned that families should not try to replicate the treatment at home.\n\n“We have to be mindful of the placebo effect, and we have to take [the findings] with a grain of salt,” Matthew Sullivan, an associate professor of microbiology at The Ohio State University, said in the release. “But it does give us hope.”']",This small study does not prove much except that more research is needed.,"In a study of just 18 children with both autism and gastrointestinal complaints, researchers transplanted healthy stool from donors into the children and observed some improvement in both gut complaints and behavior.

Above, Medtronic offices in Minneapolis.\n\nThe study, presented in Chicago at the American Heart Association meeting, was in part sponsored by device maker Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis. But it would appear to apply to such devices also made by competitors Boston Scientific Corp. and St. Jude Medical Inc.\n\nThe study\'s findings ""are indeed breathtaking,"" said prominent cardiologist Arthur J. Moss of the University of Rochester, in an editorial published online Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The New England Journal also is publishing the study, which included 1,798 patients in Canada, Europe and Turkey.\n\nWhile apparently definitive, the study raised questions about who will be willing to pay for such devices. The devices cost up to $35,000, versus the roughly $25,000 cost of a standard defibrillator. Hospital and doctor fees can raise the total cost over $50,000.\n\n""How is this going to get funded, and who\'s going to pay for it?"" asked Eric J. Topol, cardiologist and chief academic officer at Scripps Health in LaJolla, Calif. However, he noted that the reduced rate of hospitalizations in the study ""may actually present a net reduction in costs from a societal standpoint.""\n\nThe research could provide a boost for the heart-rhythm device business, whose sales have flattened in recent years, although the increased cost is one factor that might limit such a sales increase.\n\nAnother consideration Dr. Topol mentioned is an increase in immediate ""adverse events"" noted in the research, such as the dislodgement of the wire, or ""lead,"" connecting to the heart.\n\nOverall in this study, mild-to-moderate-symptom patients had a 25% relative reduction in death or heart-failure hospitalization with the pacemaker-defibrillators, compared with a standard defibrillator. (This was also a 7.1 percentage point ""absolute"" reduction in death and hospitalization—33.2% compared with 40.3%.) But it was the 29% reduction in deaths among the mild-symptom patients that many cardiologists focused on.\n\nHeart-failure specialists said the improvement appears to stem from a phenomenon called remodeling. This means that the device actually makes the otherwise-enlarged and weakened heart smaller and stronger.\n\nWilliam T. Abraham, chief of cardiology at Ohio State University, said that with the lowered death rate, the devices will gain increased adoption despite the cost. ""There will be no way to keep the floodgates closed,"" he said. Dr. Abraham headed Medtronic\'s first study of such devices a decade ago.\n\nIt\'s estimated that 22 million people world-wide have heart failure, a reduced pumping capacity of the heart that can lead to severe shortness of breath and frequent hospitalization. Of these, six million are in the U.S., and the cost of the disease in this country is about $40 billion.\n\nOne reason for the high cost is that such patients can quickly wind up in the emergency room and hospitalized after a slight change in diet leads to fluid buildup in the lungs. Patients with reduced heart capacity tend to have fluid build up in their bodies.\n\nThe complex pacemaker-defibrillator causes the heart\'s chambers to beat in a more coordinated fashion. Like a standard defibrillator, it can also ""defibrillate"" the heart, or administer a sharp shock to stop a lethal heart rhythm.\n\nJust over a month ago, Boston Scientific won federal approval to treat mild-symptom heart-failure patients with such devices. Medtronic is seeking such approval, but already sells it for more severe heart failure patients.\n\nBut the study showed an increase in the number of device- or implantation-related complications within 30 days of implant: 118 among 888 patients with the new device, compared to 61 of 898 in the standard defibrillator group.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Anthony S.L. Tang of the University of Ottawa and the University of British Columbia, explained this is partly because there are more wires, or ""leads,"" in the body with the more complex device than with a standard defibrillator.\n\nWrite to Thomas M.

Brott, director for research at the Mayo Clinic campus in Jacksonville , Fla., and lead author of the North American study, called Crest (for Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial). “Prior to the Crest trial, we really did not have the best evidence, but these results indicate that we have two very safe and effective methods to prevent stroke.”\n\nThough there are differences in risk between the two procedures and individual variations, he said, “the results from stenting are very comparable to those for carotid surgery.”\n\nBut Dr. Martin M. Brown, chief investigator for the European trial, the International Carotid Stenting Study, said that although differences in the groups studied might explain the disparate results, “nobody has really shown stenting is better than surgery, so why choose a stent?”\n\nDr. Brown added, “Even if Crest shows little difference between the two, there are three other trials that suggest surgery is safer.”\n\nStrokes are the third leading cause of death in the United States and a major cause of disability among adults. Each year, almost 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke, and more than 140,000 die.\n\nAlthough many patients take drugs like statins and blood pressure medicine to reduce their risk of stroke, surgical treatment of severe blockages in the carotid artery has been shown to be more effective than medical therapy alone in preventing ischemic strokes caused by a buildup of plaque in the arteries.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

""To best evaluate this issue, we decided to compare a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet with a Mediterranean diet in the same group of people,"" said Francesco Sofi, M.D., Ph.D, lead study author and professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Florence and Careggi University Hospital in Italy.\n\nThe study included 107 healthy but overweight participants, ages 18-75, who were randomly assigned to follow for three months either a low-calorie vegetarian diet, which included dairy and eggs, or a low-calorie Mediterranean diet for three months. The Mediterranean diet included poultry, fish and some red meat as well as fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains. After three months, the participants switched diets. Most participants were able to stay on both diets.\n\nResearchers found participants on either diet:\n\nlost about 3 pounds of body fat;\n\nlost about 4 pounds of weight overall; and\n\nexperienced about the same change in body mass index, a measure of weight in relationship to height.\n\nAuthors said they did find two differences between the diets that may be noteworthy. The vegetarian diet was more effective at reducing LDL (the ""bad"") cholesterol, while the Mediterranean diet resulted greater reductions in triglycerides, high levels of which increase the risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nStill, ""the take-home message of our study is that a low-calorie lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet can help patients reduce cardiovascular risk about the same as a low-calorie Mediterranean diet,"" Sofi said.

Anderson, Ph.D., M.P.H., M.S., an associate professor of preventive medicine at the University of California, San Diego, in California, wrote that there were similarities between the two diets that may explain the results. Both follow ""a healthy dietary pattern rich in fruits and vegetables, legumes [beans], whole grains and nuts; focusing on diet variety, nutrient density and appropriate amount of food; and limiting energy intake from saturated fats.""\n\nAnderson, who was not involved in the study, added that promoting both diets by healthcare professionals ""offer a possible solution to the ongoing challenges to prevent and manage obesity and cardiovascular diseases.""\n\nStudy limitations include the fact that participants were at ""relatively low"" risk of cardiovascular disease.

It is a current device which is very similar to the ones that people use for pain relief with electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves, what’s called TENS. The difference is that we use a particular current profile which you can stimulate the balance organs with without creating a balance disturbance. So you do not get the impression that the world is moving or that you are moving, you actually do not feel anything,” Bergquist explained.\n\nThe device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient’s head behind the ears, where the vestibular system is located.\n\nParkinson’s disease is characterized by reduced levels in the brain of the hormone dopamine, a neurotransmitter that allows different regions of the brain to communicate with one another. Symptoms of advanced Parkinson’s disease include an impaired sense of balance, as well as tremors, poor mobility, slowness and stiffness.\n\nNearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa, a drug that stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain. The effectiveness of oral levodopa reduces as Parkinson’s disease progresses in the patient and can lead to involuntary movements, or dyskinesia.\n\nIn earlier experiments on rats, researchers at Sahlgrenska showed that noisy electric stimulation of the balance organs could be used to change the activity of the brain, thereby balancing the effects of dopamine shortage and improving the animals’ motor skills and balance.\n\nThe researchers have also tested the method on ten Swedish Parkinson’s patients, in both medicated and unmedicated states. According to Sahlgrenska, on one day the patients received an active noise stimulation and on another day inactive treatment, not knowing which day the current was active. According to the research institute, the experiments showed that the active noise stimulation improved both the patients’ balance and the combined symptoms.\n\nParkinson’s sufferer Staffan Lindblom said he did not expect any great advances, but would be thankful for anything that would make living with the disease easier.\n\n“I have become hardened in the sense that I do not have too great expectations. But I still believe that something will be found at some point which could be useful. There is extensive research in this field and I hope that it eventually will come up with a result. Not a significant result but a few steps forward would really be appreciated,” he said.\n\nUnfortunately this particular treatment did not work on Lindblom, with Bergquist suspecting there could also be other causes to Lindblom’s balance problems.\n\nBergquist said he hoped the device could treat patients for whom the Levodopa drug, which turns into dopamine in the body and increases levels of the chemical, was not enough.\n\nHe also said they were working on the hypothesis that other diseases which affect the dopamine system, such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), could also benefit from this kind of treatment.\n\n“What we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where Levodopa, Parkinson’s disease where Levodopa is not enough. And in particular in patients with Parkinson’s disease where there is problem with gait and balance. But this may not be restricted to Parkinson’s disease, so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs, the balance organs to improve balance and gait,” he said.\n\nThe plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer-term study, where patients will be using it at home. If those trials prove successful, the developers hope the device could be available to the public within five years.']",This story is about the development of a portable prototype device that delivers electrical stimulation to people with Parkinson’s disease. Readers needed more information to understand whether the benefits provided are meaningful.,"To its credit, this story delivers something we don’t often see in health news: an anecdote from a patient who wasn’t helped by the treatment being profiled. That’s a welcome inclusion in a field that too often hypes the benefits of treatments with unjustifiably frothy language.
But that bright spot couldn’t completely make up for a number of deficiencies in the coverage. Our wish list includes an independent expert comment from a clinician who treats Parkinson’s patients, some discussion of the limitations of this 10-person study, and a more detailed description, with numbers, of how much the patients benefited.

There’s finally a new treatment.,"['When actress and author Lena Dunham went public about having endometriosis, a disorder of the uterus, she wanted to make something clear: The pain it causes can be completely debilitating, and women desperately need better treatments.\n\nSoon, it seems, women like Dunham who suffer from endometriosis pain will have a new option for relief. An effective treatment was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and it’s expected to arrive at pharmacies as soon as August. The pill, called elagolix (brand name Orilissa) from the drugmaker AbbVie, is the first FDA-approved oral treatment in more than a decade for the moderate to severe pain that comes with endometriosis.\n\n“This [medication] could really be transformative,” said Hugh Taylor, an OB-GYN doctor at Yale Medical School who led the key trials testing the drug. “I’m very excited to be able to start using it in my patients.”\n\nEndometriosis is one of the most common gynecological conditions, affecting one in 10 women of reproductive age. And it can be incredibly painful. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can’t shed.\n\nEvery month, a woman’s uterine lining thickens and sheds during her period if she’s not pregnant. With endometriosis, that tissue thickens and bleeds, but it happens outside of the uterus — on the fallopian tubes, even in the nose, the lungs. Because the extra tissue has no way to exit the body (it can’t go through the vagina since it’s not growing in the uterus) it builds up and becomes trapped, leading to pain and, in some cases, infertility.\n\nThere’s no cure for endometriosis. To manage symptoms, women are usually prescribed birth control or over-the-counter painkillers as a first-line approach, but they don’t always work. In severe cases, a doctor may suggest surgery to remove the extra tissue. (Dunham had eight surgeries, and ended up getting a hysterectomy, which was considered an extreme measure.)\n\nEnter elagolix. Endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease, and the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. Two large double-blind, placebo-control randomized trials, involving 1,200 women, tested whether it can help women control endometriosis pain.\n\nThe results, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, were pretty remarkable. The patients in those trials scored their pain from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain). On average, they had pain levels of 2.2 out of 3 before starting on the drug — and they experienced a 2-point reduction in pain after taking the treatment for three months.\n\n“It’s a major advance,” said Dr. Louis DePaolo, head of the fertility and infertility branch at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, “and another option women have that’s effective.”\n\nNow, the less good news: The drug won’t cure endometriosis — it’ll only tamp down the pain it causes. Researchers have also found it causes bone loss, and they have no idea about the long-term effects of taking the drug because there are no trials lasting for longer than a year. It’ll also cost women $850 per month if they don’t have insurance coverage. But for some, the risks and costs may be worth it. Here’s why.\n\nEndometriosis is incredibly common — but it can go undiagnosed for years\n\nThe three main ways endometriosis manifests are through pelvic pain, infertility, and pelvic masses such as cysts, scar tissue, and fibroids. According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, some important signs of endometriosis include:\n\nPain before and during periods\n\nPain during sex\n\nInfertility\n\nFatigue\n\nPainful urination during periods\n\nPainful bowel movements during periods\n\nBut many women don’t know they have endometriosis. It’s sometimes mistaken or dismissed for regular period pain. Definitively diagnosing the disorder requires invasive surgery; doctors need to peer inside the pelvis through a laparoscopy. (Imaging is rarely helpful in getting a clear diagnosis.) This involves making a small incision in the belly and inserting a tube with a tiny camera to see if the pelvic organs show signs of tissue scarring and buildup. So it’s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis.\n\nDoctors aren’t sure why some women get it\n\nAdding to the mystery around endometriosis: no one knows exactly what causes endometriosis, but doctors have some theories.\n\nRetrograde menstrual flow: During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.\n\nDuring a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.

If a woman’s mom or sister had endometriosis, she’s believed to be at a higher risk.\n\nThe disorder runs in families, so doctors believe there’s a genetic component.

Environmental factors: There’s some evidence to suggest environmental exposures to certain chemicals may contribute to one’s risk of developing endometriosis.\n\nThe treatments available don’t always help — and some have severe side effects\n\nWhen birth control pills or over-the-counter painkillers fail to help endometriosis pain, women are often left choosing between a monthly injection called Lupron Depot, that can put women into a profoundly menopausal state, or a Danazol, a male hormone that often causes acne and facial hair growth.\n\nThe new drug elagolix is not risk free, either. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater decreases in bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn’t entirely surprising.\n\nLike other endometriosis treatments, the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. When that happens, women experience menopausal side effects. The most common in the trials were hot flushes, headaches, and insomnia. (Elagolix is available in two doses — 150 mg per day, or 200 mg twice daily — and the women on the higher dose experienced the side effects more frequently.)\n\nBut, DePaolo pointed out, “[Elagolix] doesn’t have the pronounced side effects some of the other compounds have.” That’s because, he said, it doesn’t drive down estrogen levels as severely.\n\nSo women with endometriosis are still left choosing between terrible pain or menopausal symptoms, including bone loss. “The game changer would be something that really improves the pain permanently,” DePaolo said. “This doesn’t do that — but it is effective while it’s given.” For some women, though, that may be a game changer in and of itself.']",One clinical trial detail we think should have been included: The measured benefits for both the drug group ,"The recent approval of a drug for the treatment of endometriosis pain is shared in this story in a way that satisfies many of our review site criteria.  The story is carefully written, with lots of detailed explanations of the drug’s potential benefits — and drawbacks.

Patients on blood-thinning drugs, such as dabigatran (Pradaxa), who suffer a type of bleeding that occurs inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage) are at high risk of complications or disability. Idarucizumab (Praxbind) is an antibody that chemically binds and neutralizes the blood-thinning effects of dabigatran.\n\nAn interim analysis of the first 90 patients in a study called RE-VERSE AD (REVERSal Effects of idarucizumab in patients on Active Dabigatran) showed that idarucizumab effectively reversed dabigatran\'s anticoagulant effects, said Richard A. Bernstein, M.D., Ph.D., lead study author and director of the stroke program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nBernstein presented the results of 90 brain hemorrhage patients enrolled in the REVERSE-AD study. This included 11 men and seven women (average age 79).\n\nIn patients who received two 2.5-gram of idarucizumab infusions in a 15-minute period, blood tests revealed that dabigatran\'s blood-thinning effect was 100 percent reversed in all 18 patients with brain bleed.\n\n""This is definitely good news,"" Bernstein said. ""Idarucizumab rapidly and completely reverses the effect of dabigatran in patients with brain hemorrhage. Once the dabigatran is reversed, we can focus on taking care of the patient without worrying about the blood thinner.""\n\nThe new results are part of a large on-going phase III study testing idarucizumab in a range of patients who take dabigatran and have dangerous bleeding or need urgent surgery or other procedures that carry serious bleeding risks.\n\nIdarucizumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2015 as the first medicine designed to reverse dabigatran.\n\nResearchers say before idarucizumab was available, patients on dabigatran who needed emergency surgery were given purified clotting factors, which carry the risk of patients\' clotting systems forming dangerous blood clots.\n\n""Idarucizumab gets rid of the dabigatran, but doesn\'t seem to carry with it any tendency to increase clotting. This should make perioperative management easier and safer,"" Bernstein said.\n\nIdarucizumab\'s success so far might persuade more people to take a blood thinner when their doctors recommend it. ""The biggest problem we face in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is that almost half of patients don\'t take any blood thinner at all,"" Bernstein said. ""I see the biggest impact of idarucizumab as providing reassurance to patients that if bleeding while taking dabigatran does occur, we can quickly reverse the dabigatran. This reassurance could lead to more strokes prevented by increasing the use of an effective blood thinner.""\n\n###\n\nCo-authors are Charles V. Pollack Jr., M.D.; Jeffrey I. Weitz, M.D.; Paul A.

High-risk tumors are more aggressive and thus more likely to eventually kill the patient.\n\nChoe spoke at a Monday ASTRO teleconference.\n\nOf the blood thinners used in the study, aspirin was the one which seemed to account for most of the benefit, the researchers said\n\nThere has already been some evidence that cancer and the body\'s coagulation system might be linked in some way.\n\n""Cancer patients tend to develop clots in their legs and lungs more frequently and also patients who develop clots in their legs and lungs tend to develop cancer more frequently,"" Choe noted. ""We hypothesized that anticoagulant medication may lower the chance of death from prostate cancer in men who have localized prostate cancer.""\n\nAnd, at least according to this retrospective review of medical records, this did indeed appear to be the case. Retrospective studies -- where researchers look back over previously collected data, looking for associations -- are not as reliable as prospective trials, however.\n\nThe study included 5,275 men diagnosed with prostate cancer that had not yet spread beyond the prostate gland and had been treated with surgery or radiation. Of the almost 2,000 patients on anticoagulants in the study, 1,649 were taking aspirin, 428 warfarin, 287 clopidogrel (Plavix), 26 enoxaparin, and 408 a combination of blood thinners.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of about seven years, only 1 percent of men who had been taking an anticoagulant had died versus 4 percent of those in the control group. At 10 years, 4 percent of those taking one of these medications had died versus 10 percent in no-blood thinner group.\n\nThis translates to a risk reduction of about 50 percent, the researchers calculated.\n\nThe chances of the cancer spreading to the bone were reduced while PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood levels -- thought to be a marker for cancer\'s advance -- were also better controlled.\n\n""This benefit was seen whether these patients were treated with surgery or radiotherapy,"" Choe added.\n\nCancer cells are coated by platelets when they enter the bloodstream and are on their way to spreading. This protects them from immune cells and also helps them stick to their next location, Choe explained. Anticoagulants may work by interfering with this process.\n\nBut Choe said he is not ready to recommend routine aspirin use in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\n""It\'s premature to say that aspirin should be used in a standard-therapy way in all patients with prostate cancer,"" he said. ""But we may expect to see this benefit in those who are taking aspirin for other [usually cardiovascular] reasons.""\n\nAspirin also comes with some risks of its own, including stomach bleeding, Choe pointed out.\n\nA second study, conducted in the United States, Canada and Great Britain and also being presented at ASTRO, suggests that a combination of hormone therapy plus radiation may be the best treatment for men who have locally advanced prostate cancer with a high risk of returning.\n\nThis usurps the previous view that hormone therapy was useless or even ""unkind or toxic,"" said study lead author Dr. Malcolm Mason, a radiation oncologist with Cardiff University in Wales.\n\nThis trial, the largest of its kind, involved about 1,200 men who were randomly chosen to receive hormone therapy alone or a combination of that and radiation.\n\nAn initial review at six years suggested that those taking the combination therapy had a 43 percent reduced risk of dying from prostate cancer, while side effects were not ""major,"" Mason said. ""If the figures from the interim analysis are similar to the final analysis, we would expect a 43 percent reduction in the chances of death from prostate cancer in men with this regimen,"" he said.\n\n""We feel these results are practice changing,"" Mason added. ""The standard treatment for localized, high-risk prostate cancer for people who are fit for radiotherapy should be a combination of hormone therapy plus radiotherapy.""\n\nExperts note that studies presented at scientific meetings do not face the same peer-review scrutiny as those published in reputable journals.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.']","This story came so close at times to addressing key issues but still fell short on association vs. causation, on limitations of observational studies, on costs, and on independent perspectives.  ","


 
Readers of this story gets a fairly detailed description of a study that looked at medical records of prostate cancer patients to see if the use of anticoagulant drugs, including aspirin, was associated with any differences in outcomes. However, readers also get a headline and lead that leap to the conclusion (unsupported by this study) that aspirin may cause death rates to drop. The story also misleads readers by failing to point out that what the researchers reported were differences in deaths from prostate cancer, not deaths overall.
The caution about the relative lack of peer review scrutiny of studies presented at medical meetings is welcome.

[Brown University] -- New results from a clinical trial involving more than 900 military veterans at high risk for keratinocyte carcinoma skin cancer provides evidence that using the generic skin cream fluorouacil 5 percent for two to four weeks may reduce the risk of a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) needing surgery by 75 percent within a year.\n\nThe finding that less than one month\'s use of fluorouacil 5% (5-FU) appeared to prevent cancer for up to a year is encouraging, said lead author Dr. Martin A. Weinstock, a professor of dermatology in the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and chief of dermatology at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nThe dose is the same as dermatologists currently employ to treat actinic keratosis. In a 2015 study, Weinstock and co-authors showed the up to four-week regimen of 5-FU had a multi-year preventive benefit in reducing the number of actinic keratosis (AK) and the need for treatment. Earlier this year, they also showed that the medicine prevents new AKs from emerging for two to three years.\n\nMeanwhile, current means for preventing new carcinomas in high-risk patients -- sunscreen or oral medications -- cease to work as soon as they are no longer used. But in the new study, 5-FU appeared to provide prolonged protection after discontinuation and could be combined with sunscreen, Weinstock said.\n\nIn the absence of such a long-lasting prevention option, he said, the typical approach to caring for patients with a history of prior carcinomas is to monitor for the next cancer and then remove it surgically -- an effective but imposing strategy often called ""wait and cut.""\n\n""People don\'t appreciate having stuff cut on their face a lot,"" said Weinstock, who led the trial funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and conducted at a dozen V.A. hospitals around the country. ""They do it if there is a cancer there, but we want to take a proactive approach where we can give them something to reduce their risk of getting new cancers.""\n\nThe new results are published in JAMA Dermatology.\n\nThe VAKCC trial\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, the Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial randomly assigned 932 veterans who each had at least two prior basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) or SCCs to either receive the 5-FU cream or a cream just like it but without the active ingredient as an experimental control. All of the veterans were instructed to apply their cream twice a day to their face and ears for up to four weeks. They also received a 30 SPF sunscreen and received education about skin cancer, sunscreen and sun safety.\n\nThe two groups were both almost exclusively white and male, and they averaged 71 years of age. The experimental and control groups were very similar along all other measured characteristics, including their self- reported degree of prior sun exposure and sunburn. Veterans typically have spent a large amount of time in the sun during their years of service.\n\nBoth groups went to their V.A. center twice a year for two to four years for follow-up exams with a dermatologist. Neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5-FU and who received the placebo.\n\nSome reduced risks\n\nAfter the first year, 20 of the 464 veterans in the control group developed a squamous cell carcinoma that required surgery, but only five of the 468 veterans who got 5-FU did, a statistically significant 75 percent reduction in the risk, according to the study. For the subsequent three years, there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who required surgical treatment for an SCC.\n\nFor BCCs, there was an 11 percent reduced risk after the first year among the group that received 5-FU, but that difference was not statistically significant. In the second year, BCC cases requiring surgery rose in the 5-FU group, but in years three and four, and by the end of the study, there was no significant overall difference in risk of developing a BCC requiring surgical treatment. After four years, 298 of all study the participants had developed at least one BCC, and 108 had developed at least one SCC.\n\nThe study did show a significant decrease in the risk of needing Mohs surgery to treat a BCC in the first year. Mohs surgery is more effective but also more elaborate and expensive than a conventional procedure, Weinstock said. In the study\'s first year, 36 BCCs were treated with Mohs surgery in 27 participants in the control group, but only 17 BCCs were treated with the procedure among 14 patients in the 5-FU group.\n\n""This suggests that using the 5-FU can reduce the resources needed to treat these carcinomas,"" Weinstock said.\n\nThe cream does have common side effects including reddened, more sensitive and often crusty skin, effects that resolve when the application of the cream stops, Weinstock acknowledged. After the study\'s first six months, 21 percent of the 5-FU group rated the side effects as ""severe,"" and 40 percent rated them as ""moderate.""\n\nBut after six months and again at the end of the four-year trial, 87 percent of participants in the 5-FU group said they\'d be willing to repeat the treatment if it proved effective in reducing skin cancer.\n\nIn his clinical work, Weinstock said that for particularly high-risk patients, he has recommended 5-FU treatment. Based on the study results, it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year.\n\n""The most remarkable thing about this study is that now we have something to use that doesn\'t lose its effectiveness when you stop using it,"" Weinstock said. ""But this is the first study of its type. I\'m hopeful there will be other studies that show other sorts of regimens that last longer and do a better job over time as science progresses. This is an important first step.""\n\nHe and colleagues are planning further studies, including one to determine the cost-effectiveness of 5-FU treatment.\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Weinstock, the new study has many authors from the VAKCC trial including at each of the study\'s 12 sites: Boston; Bay Pines, Fla.; Chicago, Ill.; Palo Alto, Calif.; Atlanta; Loma Linda Calif.; Minneapolis; Nashville; Denver; Durham, N.C.; Philadelphia; and Miami.']",The release clearly states benefits and potential harms of using the drug.,"Getty Images
This release reports on a large multi-center clinical trial intended to gauge the preventative value of using a cream containing 5 percent fluorouacil as a means of reducing the occurrence of both squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinomas. It says that the cream appears to reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinomas among the elderly veterans in the trial by 75 percent, although it has no statistically significant effect on reducing basal cell carcinomas. The release also states that the protection appears to only extend for the first year.

The company says this is a major step forward in treating PAD because, unlike stents, atherectomy ""leaves no metal behind.""\n\nA stent is a tiny metal wire mesh tube that props open an artery and is left there permanently. But in leg arteries, the active flexing can cause a stent to break. Being able to clear the blockage just as well without stents reduces possible complications and gives greater flexibility to doctors later, said Brian Verrier, vice president and general manager of peripheral vascular for Covidien.\n\n""This particular product plays very strongly into where we see the market going,"" he said. ""The potential is huge.""\n\nAtherectomy is only used in about 15 to 20 percent of PAD cases, but Dr. Lawrence Garcia, a principal investigator in the study, said he expects that to change with these results.\n\n""I think it has the potential to increase business for Covidien,"" Garcia, chief of interventional cardiology and vascular interventions at St. Elizabeth\'s Medical Center in Boston, said Thursday. He said he has no financial stake in the company.\n\nThe study is the largest to look at the effectiveness of atherectomy, Covidien said, and enrolled 800 patients at 47 centers in the U.S. and Europe. Doctors found that Covidien\'s SilverHawk and TurboHawk devices, which are snaked down through a small incision near the groin and basically shave away and remove the plaque, performed as well after 12 months as angioplasty and stenting.\n\nThe devices had been developed at EV3 Inc., a Plymouth med-tech company that Covidien acquired in 2010.\n\nThomas Gunderson, a senior analyst for Piper Jaffray & Co., said the Covidien study could lead to greater use of atherectomy and a bigger market.\n\n""It\'s a good opportunity,"" Gunderson said. ""This will reawaken both the users and the nonusers to say, wait a second, now we have data.""\n\nAlso of note, Garcia said, is that the procedure proved as effective at improving blood flow for patients with diabetes as those without diabetes. It\'s a key finding, because patients with diabetes usually suffer from more advanced PAD and the blood vessels re-clog faster than for those who do not.\n\nCovidien, based in Ireland, has its U.S. headquarters in Massachusetts. It also has a significant presence in the Twin Cities. In 2010, it acquired EV3, a maker of technology that treats lower extremity vascular and neurovascular diseases.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, about 10 million people in the U.S. are affected by PAD, which can lead to heart attack, stroke, amputation and death. It occurs when arteries in the legs become narrowed or blocked by plaque. Blockages can result in severe pain, limited mobility and nonhealing leg ulcers.\n\nJames Walsh • 612-673-7428']",We understand business section stories may take a different approach.  But online readers – which is how we found this story – find this kind of health care news the same way they find all other stories – all lumped together on the web.  So we apply the same standards to these stories as we would to any.,"Too much company perspective, accompanied by no independent expert perspective makes this a one-sided story.
Based on the company’s press release, the study was a post marketing, open label study with no comparator arm.  So the device was not compared directly with angioplasty or angioplasty and stent.  According to the principal investigator, the results were comparable to those obtained in other studies using angioplasty and stent.  But, there was no direct comparison made in the study and comparing results from two different studies is speculative at best.  So, while there is an impression made that the Covidien device is “as good” as angioplasty and stent, that impression is not backed up by data.  We are told that there is “no metal left behind” but the importance of that fact is left to the reader’s imagination.
Comparative cost of treatment, comparative harms and long term results are needed to determine if the device is going to live up to expectations.

They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism.\n\nA leading biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with backing from five scientists who are Nobel prize recipients, is wading into the murky world of dietary supplements with a new antiaging pill that is said to restore muscle tissue, improve brain function, and increase energy levels by improving “metabolic health.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany products in the supplement business are launched with questionable science, but Elysium said studies in mice show a clear connection between increased levels of this compound, called NAD, and improved health in older mice.\n\n“There have been a lot of new findings in the past five years identifying some extremely promising compounds that promote wellness and health. [We want to] make them available for people to improve their health before they get sick,” said Guarente, an Elysium Health founder and its chief scientific officer. “We are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.”\n\nThe active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries. Both substances are available individually as dietary supplements.\n\nAt a recommended dose of two gel caps daily, a month’s supply of Basis will cost $60 ($50 with a membership) and will be available online only. The company’s chief executive is Eric Marcotulli, previously a partner at the Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital.\n\nAmong the scientific heavyweights advising Elysium Health are Martin Karplus, emeritus professor of chemistry at Harvard and a 2013 Nobel Laureate; Tom Sudhof, a Stanford School of Medicine professor who received a Nobel in 2013; Eric Kandel, a biochemist and biophysicist at Columbia University and a 2000 Nobel Laureate; Aaron Ciechanover, distinguished research professor at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and a 2004 Nobel recipient; and Jack Szostak, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who received a Nobel in 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSzostak said his role at Elysium Health is to scour scientific literature for new natural compounds that are shown to improve health and bring them to the company’s attention as potential ingredients in new products.\n\n“What interests me in this is that it is a different challenge, to apply what we are learning through basic research, not just to curing disease but to keeping people healthy,” said Szostak, who runs a research lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. “If you go to Whole Foods or CVS, you see miles of dietary supplements and vitamins. Most of them have no scientific basis, and you don’t know what you are getting.”\n\nGuarente was involved in several other efforts to develop antiaging medicines that did not pan out. He was a founder of Elixir Pharmaceuticals and then became involved with Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which conducted research into the potential antiaging properties of a chemical found in red wine.\n\nWith Elysium, Guarente and his colleagues are entering an industry with a mixed reputation. At $25 billion annually and growing, vitamins and supplements are hugely popular among consumers. But the business has often been criticized by mainstream medicine for making ambitious claims about quick cures and miraculous health improvements that are not subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine.\n\nBut as a supplement, Basis and similar products only have to be shown to be safe for humans to take, with labels that are not misleading. With Basis, for example, there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice.\n\nIndeed, one scientist not involved with Elysium questions the company’s marketing pitch, saying there is too little information to know what Basis can do.\n\n“It is not quite clear to me what they want to target with this pill,” said Pere Puigserver, a biology professor at Harvard Medical School. “What does it mean, to improve metabolic health? And what exactly is being repaired in the body? And is the outcome the same for everyone?”\n\nPuigserver, who runs a cancer biology lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, noted that addressing health and aging through metabolism involves a complex web of pathways and mechanisms.\n\n“We need more information on how this works precisely in people before we can advise them to take anything,” he said.\n\nGuarente pledged that Elysium Health would be unlike most other companies in the business: It is conducting studies of its pill in humans and will release the results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“As soon as we have analyzed the data, we will publish them on our website,” he said.\n\nOne of the venture capitalists backing Elysium Health acknowledged that skepticism is among the company’s greater challenges.\n\n“This space is traditionally driven by marketing language,” said Kal Vapuri, whose New York firm Trisiras Group is one of Elysium’s initial funders. “But we will be data-driven and will communicate the complexities of science in simple ways.”\n\nStefanie Friedhoff can be reached at stefanie.friedhoff @globe.com. Follow her on twitter @Stefanie2000']",The supplement company described in this this story has retained five Nobel laureates as scientific advisers–and it’s not shy about trumpeting that fact. Could they be compensating for something?,"The pill described in this story is the first product of Elysium Health, a new company formed with the backing of many leading researchers in the field. The company claims to be science and data driven and suggests that its product is superior to other dietary supplements that haven’t been scientifically validated. We think the story should have been more forceful in exposing the hypocrisy of that stance. The company says it will provide evidence to support its claims at some point in the future, but it is selling the supplements NOW. So it is essentially doing the same thing that other unscrupulous supplement sellers are doing — enriching themselves based on the “promise” of a product that hasn’t been shown to provide any health benefit. The fact that Nobel laureates are the ones doing it is unfortunate, since their stature will distract consumers from the emptiness of the company’s claims.
With all that being said, the article does inject some context and a healthy dose of skepticism into this trendy topic. It doesn’t accept the company’s claims without challenge. It juxtaposes the big name affiliations of the company’s leaders and advisers with the uncertainty surrounding their wares. We just think it should have done more on that front and put it higher up in the story.

The participants had no history of stroke at the beginning of the study.\n\nOlive oil is a component of the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in healthy fats (like olive oil and nuts), plus whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fish and chicken. Red meat and wine are consumed in moderate amounts, and regular physical activity is part of the regimen as well. Other studies have linked the Mediterranean diet with a lower risk of heart disease, but scientists are still assessing the roles various portions of the diet and lifestyle play.\n\nIn this study, participants were surveyed about how much olive oil they consumed: About 23% used none, 40% were moderate users (cooking with it or using it as a dressing or with bread) and about 37% were intensive users (using it in cooking and as a dressing or with bread).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an average 5.25 years of follow-up, 148 strokes occurred.

The results were statistically significant for ischemic stroke (caused by blockage of an artery to the brain) but not hemorrahagic stroke (caused by the rupture of a blood vessel).\n\nThe authors noted that the findings could be used to make dietary recommendations for older people at risk for stroke.

In the study, women who skipped chemo based on the test had less than a 1 percent chance of cancer recurring far away, such as the liver or lungs, within the next five years.\n\nMany women with early-stage breast cancer can skip chemotherapy without hurting their odds of beating the disease — good news from a major study that shows the value of a gene-activity test to gauge each patient's risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n''You can't do better than that,'' said the study leader, Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.\n\nAn independent expert, Dr. Clifford Hudis of New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, agreed.\n\n''There is really no chance that chemotherapy could make that number better,'' he said. Using the gene test ''lets us focus our chemotherapy more on the higher risk patients who do benefit'' and spare others the ordeal.\n\nThe study was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Results were published online Monday by the New England Journal of Medicine and discussed at the European Cancer Congress in Vienna.\n\nThe study involved the most common type of breast cancer — early stage, without spread to lymph nodes; hormone-positive, meaning the tumor's growth is fueled by estrogen or progesterone; and not the type that the drug Herceptin targets. Each year, more than 100,000 women in the United States alone are diagnosed with this.\n\nThe usual treatment is surgery followed by years of a hormone-blocking drug. But many women also are urged to have chemo, to help kill any stray cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast and could seed a new cancer later. Doctors know that most of these women don't need chemo but there are no great ways to tell who can safely skip it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA California company, Genomic Health Inc., has sold a test called Oncotype DX since 2004 to help gauge this risk. The test measures the activity of genes that control cell growth, and others that indicate a likely response to hormone therapy treatment.\n\nPast studies have looked at how women classified as low, intermediate or high risk by the test have fared. The new study is the first to assign women treatments based on their scores and track recurrence rates.\n\nOf the 10,253 women in the study, 16 percent were classified as low risk, 67 percent as intermediate and 17 percent as high risk for recurrence by the test. The high-risk group was given chemotherapy and hormone-blocking drugs. Women in the middle group were randomly assigned to get hormone therapy alone or to add chemo. Results on these groups are not yet ready — the study is continuing.\n\nBut independent monitors recommended the results on the low-risk group be released, because it was clear that adding chemo would not improve their fate.\n\nAfter five years, about 99 percent had not relapsed, and 98 percent were alive. About 94 percent were free of any invasive cancer, including new cancers at other sites or in the opposite breast.\n\n''These patients who had low risk scores by Oncotype did extraordinarily well at five years,'' said Dr. Hope Rugo, a breast cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, with no role in the study. ''There is no chance that for these patients, that chemotherapy would have any benefit.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Karen Beckerman, a New York City obstetrician diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, said she was advised to have chemo but feared complications. A doctor suggested the gene test and she scored very low for recurrence risk.\n\n''I was convinced that there was no indication for chemotherapy. I was thrilled not to have to have it,'' and has been fine since then, she said.\n\nMary Lou Smith, a breast cancer survivor and advocate who helped design the trial for ECOG, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, which ran it, said she thought women ''would be thrilled'' to skip chemo.\n\n''Patients love the idea of a test'' to help reduce uncertainty about treatment, she said. ''I've had chemotherapy. It's not pretty.''\n\nThe test costs $4,175, which Medicare and many insurers cover. Others besides Oncotype DX also are on the market, and Hudis said he hopes the new study will encourage more, to compete on price and accuracy.\n\n''The future is bright'' for gene tests to more precisely guide treatment, he said.""]",This Associated Press story does a pretty thorough job addressing our criteria — especially under a tight deadline.,"A study in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) looked into the most common type of breast cancer – early stage, without spread to lymph nodes and hormone positive, meaning the tumor’s growth is promoted by estrogen and/or progesterone. According to the Associated Press article on the study, more than 100,000 women in the US are diagnosed with this type.
Doctors usually remove the tumor via surgery and prescribe hormone-blocking drugs, but they are unsure whether chemotherapy can offer additional benefits for some women. In this NEJM study, patients with this common breast cancer took a gene test to see whether their tumors would respond well to hormone-blocking drugs alone. Those labeled “low risk” based on this gene test skipped chemo and saw they had a very low rate of cancer recurrence within five years.
The Associated Press article touches upon all the main points – costs of the gene test, study design and benefits, context – and we applaud how thoroughly the story addresses some of our criteria, especially on a tight deadline. Our main suggestion is to look for and report on conflicts of interest, especially if they concern the first author and are relevant to the study.

The data published in the June 22nd issue of the New England Journal of Medicine showed that Flublok Quadrivalent provided significantly improved protection against laboratory confirmed influenza illness in older adults.\n\nThe publication notes that approximately 9,000 people aged 50 and older were enrolled and randomized in an efficacy study designed to compare Flublok Quadrivalent to a traditional quadrivalent vaccine. People who were given Flublok Quadrivalent were over 40% less likely to develop culture-confirmed influenza. This data satisfies both pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority and superiority of Flublok over the traditional egg-based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine. Flublok Quadrivalent was approved by the FDA in October 2016 and will be available nationwide in prefilled syringes for the upcoming flu season.\n\n""This study shows that Flublok® Quadrivalent, produced with modern recombinant technology can provide better protection against confirmed influenza-like illness among older adults than standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine produced with traditional technology,"" said Lisa Dunkle MD, Chief Medical Officer of Protein Sciences. ""We demonstrated statistically significantly better protection by Flublok based on considerably fewer people contracting the flu after vaccination with Flublok Quadrivalent. Today, we announce that these peer-reviewed results have been published in the highly respected New England Journal of Medicine. Furthermore, physicians are eligible for up to 1 hour AMA PRA category 1 CME credit for reading the article. Clearly, Flublok represents a major step forward in combating influenza on a global scale.""\n\nFlublok is the only flu vaccine made without the use of eggs and therefore is not subject to the mutations that are sometimes introduced into the vaccine during the process of egg adaptation that can cause the traditional vaccines to be ineffective (see Skowronski et al. (2014) PLOS ONE 9(3), e92153). Flublok contains three times more active ingredients than traditional vaccines and produced significantly higher immune responses to the A strains of influenza (especially H3N2) in the Flublok Quadrivalent study. Furthermore, Flublok Quadrivalent is the first and only high antigen-content quadrivalent flu vaccine that with its high efficacy makes it ideal for older adults and those with a compromised immune system. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain influenza virus, antibiotics, formaldehyde, preservatives, egg protein, latex, gluten or gelatin unlike other flu vaccines. Flublok Quadrivalent is FDA approved for adults 18 and older.\n\nFor more information about Flublok, please visit www.flublok.com.\n\nAbout Protein Sciences\n\nProtein Sciences is a world leader in vaccine development and protein production. Our mission is our inspiration: to save lives and improve health through the creation of innovative vaccines and biopharmaceuticals.\n\nAbout Flublok®\n\nFlublok, the world\'s first recombinant protein-based vaccine for the prevention of seasonal influenza disease, is approved for all adults over 18 years. FDA approved the quadrivalent formulation (""Flublok Quadrivalent"") in October 2016 that will be commercially available for everyone over 18 years for the 2017/18 influenza season. Flublok is the only flu vaccine made in a 100% egg-free system using modern cell culture technology, making it unnecessary to use an infectious influenza virus, antibiotics or harsh chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde) in manufacturing. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain any preservatives (e.g., thimerosal - a form of mercury), egg proteins, gelatin or latex. In addition, Flublok contains three times more antigen than traditional flu vaccines (3x45mcg hemagglutinin protein versus 3x15mcg hemagglutinin protein). In a 2014/15 post-marketing study of 9,000 adults 50 years and older, people who received Flublok were over 40% less likely to develop cell culture confirmed influenza than people who received a traditional flu vaccine. Flublok is an exact copy of the influenza virus coat protein and is not subject to the egg-adapted mutations associated with low vaccine effectiveness (see Skowronski et al.

However, there are two significant shortcomings: first, the release does not address cost — which is problematic, given that the release comes from the company itself; and second, the release only tells readers about the benefits of the vaccine in terms of relative risk, as opposed to absolute risk. This is an important distinction — which we’ve discussed quite a bit — and we’ll address it at greater length below. Furthermore, the release seems to inflate the reduction in relative risk from 30 percent to 40 percent. Data in the study itself only supports a 30 percent relative risk reduction.

Forty percent of those who had received a gastric bypass procedure and 29% who received a gastric band were considered in remission from diabetes and no longer needed to take medication after three years. In comparison, no one in the group who received intensive lifestyle intervention resolved their diabetes.\n\n“I do think it adds strongly to the growing body of data that [surgery] should be considered” to treat people with obesity and diabetes, said Anita Courcoulas, head of minimally invasive bariatric and general surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who led the study.\n\nHowever, to conclude firmly that surgery is the better option, data from more patients across several different treatment centers, followed for up to seven years after surgery, is needed, according to Dr. Courcoulas. Her group is conducting such a study, along with researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle, the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston and the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association lists surgery as one option in its 2015 medical care guidelines for diabetic patients with a body-mass index over 35 but says there is insufficient evidence of benefit in those who are less overweight.\n\n“In general, I agree that short-term outcomes for bariatric surgery...are more dramatic than that seen with lifestyle intervention,” wrote Jane Chiang, senior vice president for medical affairs and community information at the American Diabetes Association, in an email. However, “not everyone is a strong candidate for bariatric surgery.” Treatment should be tailored to each patient, she said.\n\nThe ADA’s Professional Practice Committee, which develops its medical guidelines, will carefully review the study and assess if any changes to clinical practice are warranted, according to Dr. Chiang.\n\nIn 2011, the International Diabetes Federation announced a position change stating that surgical options should be considered earlier on for eligible patients to help prevent complications from Type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe new study, which began in 2009, didn’t look at a bariatric surgery procedure that has become popular in recent years, known as the sleeve gastrectomy, said Dr. Courcoulas. However, a study by the Cleveland Clinic published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine did, and found a similar significant improvement in Type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery procedures, including the sleeve gastrectomy, over lifestyle intervention.\n\nWhy bariatric surgery clears up diabetes isn’t fully understood and patients have different degrees of response to the procedures, said Dr. Courcoulas. Patients who undergo surgery usually lose significantly more weight than those receiving lifestyle intervention, but their diabetes often clears up before they lose a significant amount of weight, suggesting that weight loss alone isn’t the reason.\n\nSome doctors say gastric bypass surgery appears especially beneficial, possibly because the procedure involves reducing the stomach to the size of a small pouch and bypassing a portion of the intestine, which potentially changes certain gastrointestinal hormones or other factors.\n\nMichel Gagner, a clinical professor of surgery at Florida International University who wasn’t involved in the study but wrote an editorial accompanying the piece in the journal, said bariatric surgery should be used much more widely to treat diabetes, the way that heart surgery was widely used to treat coronary artery disease.\n\n“I don’t know how many studies we need to do to keep comparing the best medical treatment to surgery, but it’s clear to me that surgery is the only thing that offers resolution to diabetes,” said Dr. Gagner.\n\nWrite to Shirley S. Wang at shirley.wang@wsj.com']","A generally solid report on a study comparing bariatric surgery to lifestyle changes for type 2 diabetes. As always, we have a few suggestions for improvement.","A model depicting the adjustable gastric band device.

Overall, the story does a good job of laying out the benefits and goes to great lengths to put the results in context, noting in the lede sentence that this study is merely “adding” to the “growing body of evidence” favoring surgery over life style treatments for diabetes resolution. It also quotes those who caution readers about some limits of the study and warn against a willy-nilly rush to the operating room.

It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained.\n\nAbout 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nFor those whose atrial fibrillation can\'t be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.\n\n""Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,"" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo.\n\nBut the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain.\n\nComplications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said.\n\nIn addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained.\n\nDuring the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium.\n\nThe burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hugh Calkins, ""Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results."" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nThe complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said.\n\n""Patients don\'t get a lifetime certificate saying you\'re cured,"" Calkins said. ""For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,"" he added.\n\nThe new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Their average age was 59, and all had undergone catheter ablation.\n\nAblation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias -- irregular heart beats -- for three to 12 months after the procedure.\n\nAccording to Arbelo, 91 percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms, while 66 percent do so to improve their quality of life.\n\nAtrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later.\n\nAbout 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said.\n\nAfter the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don\'t need them, Arbelo suggested.\n\nThe study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He said, ""Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging.""\n\nIn certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted.\n\n""Of concern is that complication rates are still higher than desirable for this procedure, and there was suboptimal use of stroke-preventing anticoagulation [anti-clotting] therapy after the procedure,"" added Fonarow, who was not involved with the study.\n\n""Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of catheter ablation and its potential role as first-line therapy,"" he suggested.\n\nCatheter ablation is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, the researchers said.\n\nThe report was published online recently in the European Heart Journal.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about atrial fibrillation, visit the American Heart Association.']","The story does some things well: It discussed the negatives, such as the complication rate to the procedure. And multiple expert perspectives were included.","This HealthDay story reports on a paper published in the European Heart Journal that looked at the outcomes of a procedure known as catheter ablation for people who have atrial fibrillation.
We liked how the story countered the positive findings with the caveats and complications, which are too often overlooked in news stories about research.
However, the story didn’t clearly explain that this was not a randomized controlled trial–it was essentially a tallying of complication and success rates in a group of people who all had the procedure done. And that’s an important distinction to make, because as one cardiac electrophysiologist columnist pointed out and this systematic review touches upon, there’s a lack of solid trial data on this procedure.

Users may get bored or overwhelmed and may stop using the apps after a few weeks.\n\nBut participants robustly used the IntelliCare interactive apps as many as four times daily -- or an average of 195 times -- for eight weeks of the study. They spent an average of one minute using each app, with longer times for apps with relaxation videos.\n\nThe 96 participants who completed the research study reported that they experienced about a 50 percent decrease in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The short-term study-related reductions are comparable to results expected in clinical practice using psychotherapy or with that seen using antidepressant medication.\n\nThe study will be published Jan. 5 in the Journal of Medical Internet Research.\n\n""We designed these apps so they fit easily into people\'s lives and could be used as simply as apps to find a restaurant or directions,"" said lead study author David Mohr, professor of preventive medicine and director of the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\n""Some of the participants kept using them after the study because they felt that the apps helped them feel better,"" Mohr said. ""There were many apps to try during the study, so there was a sense of novelty.""\n\nParticipants had access to the 13 IntelliCare apps from Google Play and received eight weeks of coaching for the use of IntelliCare. Coaching included an initial phone call plus two or more text messages per week over the eight weeks. In the study, 105 participants were enrolled and 96 of them completed the study.\n\nThe preliminary study did not include a control arm, so it\'s possible that some people who enrolled in the trial would have improved anyway, partly because they may have been motivated to try something new, Mohr said. He now has launched a larger trial, recruiting 300 participants, with a control arm.\n\nSome of the IntelliCare apps include:\n\nDaily Feats: designed to motivate you to add worthwhile and rewarding activities into your day to increase your overall satisfaction in life.\n\nPurple Chill: designed to help you unwind with audio recordings that guide you through exercises to de-stress and worry less.\n\nSlumber Time: designed to ease you into a good night\'s rest.\n\nMy Mantra: designed to help you create motivating mantras to highlight your strengths and values.\n\n""Using digital tools for mental health is emerging as an important part of our future,"" Mohr said. ""These are designed to help the millions of people who want support but can\'t get to a therapist\'s office.""\n\nMore than 20 percent of Americans have significant symptoms of depression or anxiety each year, but only around 20 percent of people with a mental health problem get adequate treatment.\n\nThe IntelliCare algorithm recommends new apps each week to keep the experience fresh, provide new opportunities for learning skills and avoid user boredom. Although the apps are not validated, each one was designed by Northwestern clinicians and based on validated techniques used by therapists.\n\nIntelliCare is a national research study. Individuals can download the apps free with no financial obligation. But Northwestern researchers hope participants will provide confidential feedback, via four weekly questions, that will be used to further develop the system. The data will help the system make even better recommendations and provide more personalized treatment.\n\nPeople also may enroll in a study in which they will be paid to provide even more feedback. Some also will have access to an IntelliCare coach via text messaging and phone calls, who are available to support them in using the apps.\n\n""We now have evidence these approaches will likely work,"" Mohr said. ""They are designed to teach many of the same skills therapists teach patients. Different apps are expected to work for different people. The goal is to find what\'s right for you.""\n\n###\n\nOther Northwestern authors include Kate Tomasino, Emily Lattie, Hannah Palac, Mary J Kwasny, Kenneth Weingardt, Leland R Bardsley, Lauren Caccamo, Colleen Stiles-Shields and Stephen Schueller. Rebecca Rossom, a researcher with HealthPartners Institute, also was a study co-author.\n\nThe study was supported by grant R01 MH100482 from the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health.']","If Northwestern University wants us to think of this app as the Yelp of depression treatment, it will need to serve up more convincing evidence than what was provided in this skimpy news release.","This release on a suite of smartphone apps designed to reduce depression and anxiety comes from a prestigious university and was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Issued under embargo, an emailed version of the release pitched journalists with the titillating subject heading: “Depression Apps as Fast as Finding Good Sushi.”
But if Northwestern University wants us to think of this app as the Yelp of depression treatment, it will need to serve up more convincing evidence than what was provided in this skimpy news release. After all, treating depression is a little more complicated than locating a good California roll, and we expect to see substantial backing for the suggestion that these apps work as well as clinician-delivered psychotherapy or antidepressant medication. The release’s comparison of the app to medication is fatally flawed because more than half of the participants were already taking antidepressants when they enrolled in the study, and about 20% were receiving psychotherapy. How much of the benefit was due to the app and how much to these or other factors is impossible to say.
Bottom line: while the release deserves some credit for highlighting one major weakness of the study — the lack of a control group — it didn’t mention other key limitations or adequately describe the scope of the benefits seen. Like the sushi lovers courted in the subject heading, anyone feasting on this release is likely to be hungry again in an hour — if not sooner.

The margarines used in the study were developed for the researchers by food and consumer goods giant Unilever.\n\nDoctors, however, are unlikely to rush to change clinical practice. Many already prescribe omega-3 fish oil capsules, including GlaxoSmithKline’s Lovaza, to reduce triglycerides, a type of blood fat linked to clogged arteries.\n\n“It will be viewed as a largely negative study and people who are enthusiasts for omega fatty acids will continue to be enthusiasts and people who are skeptics will continue to be skeptics,” said Scott Wright of the Mayo Clinic in the United States, who was not involved in the research.\n\nDaan Kromhout of Wageningen University, who led the study, told the European Society of Cardiology the lack of efficacy might reflect the good background drug treatment patients were receiving, with 85 percent on cholesterol-lowering statins, as well as blood pressure and blood-thinning tablets.\n\n“We found the cardiovascular mortality rate in the study population was only half that expected, probably because of their excellent treatment,” he said.\n\n“This may also be why the rate of major cardiovascular events during follow-up was no lower in the fatty acid groups than in the placebo group.”\n\nAll the men and women in the Dutch study were aged between 60 and 80 and had suffered a heart attack roughly four years previously.\n\nThey were randomly assigned use of one of four margarines on bread instead of their regular spread — one containing no extra omega-3 fatty acids; one with 400 milligrams a day of extra eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); one with 2 grams of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA); and one with a combination of EPA-DHA and ALA.\n\nFish like salmon, herring and sardine are a common source of EPA-DHA, while ALA is found in vegetables including soybeans, flax seeds and walnuts.\n\nDespite the overall negative results, researchers did find there was a reduction in repeat heart attacks and other cardiovascular events in women who took ALA margarine, although this was not statistically significant. Diabetes patients also showed a possible benefit.\n\nUnilever, whose margarine brands that contain omega-3 include Flora and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, said the lack of benefit seen with EPA and DHA was surprising, considering the weight of evidence published to date.\n\n“The results indicate that more investigation is required into the efficacy of vegetable omega 3, but do not question the current authoritative dietary recommendations and advices for omega 3 intakes on which our products are based,” the company said in a statement.\n\nThe results of the study, which was supported by the Netherlands Heart Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and Unilever, were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">One of three stories we reviewed on this paper in the NEJM.

The SelectMDx test can help predict the likelihood that clinically significant prostate cancer will be found by a biopsy.\n\nThe study published in The Journal of Urology, led by researchers at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was designed to elucidate the cost-effectiveness of SelectMDx in a population of U.S. men with elevated PSA, a marker of prostate cancer risk. Researchers analyzed the impact of utilizing the non-invasive diagnostic test prior to prostate biopsy. The primary objective was to characterize changes in health outcomes, measured in quality-adjusted life years, and a secondary objective was evaluating healthcare costs.\n\nThe researchers found that incorporating SelectMDx resulted in an average gain of 0.045 life years, or approximately 16 days, in full health gained at a cost-savings of $1,694 for each patient undergoing biopsy. Extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of 311,879 patients per year undergoing biopsy resulted in 14,035 life years in full health gained with an annual cost saving of more than $500 million for each cohort.\n\n""This study demonstrated that routine use of SelectMDx to guide biopsy decision-making improves health outcomes and lowers healthcare costs associated with prostate cancer risk assessment in a population of U.S. men,"" said Dr. Matthew Resnick from the departments of Urologic Surgery and Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN. ""We believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment strategies through improvements in both quality and cost, the numerator and denominator of the health care value equation.""\n\nEvery year, 1.3 million men in the U.S. undergo a prostate biopsy.i Although a biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer, the procedure is invasive and results in complications in 18 percent of patients, with 3 percent hospitalized for infection within 30 days.ii,iii,iv Common complications from a prostate biopsy may include bleeding, infection, sepsis/bacteremia, urinary symptoms/retention, and sexual dysfunction.\n\n""While biopsy is the only path to prostate cancer diagnosis, no man wants to, nor should have to, go through the uncomfortable, costly procedure if it can be avoided,"" said Dr. Jan Groen, Chief Executive Officer of MDxHealth.

SelectMDx helps identify men at increased risk of harboring aggressive, potentially lethal, prostate cancer who may benefit most from a prostate biopsy and earlier detection. The test helps to reduce the need for MRI procedures and invasive prostate biopsies by up to 50%, thereby improving quality of life and lowering healthcare costs per patient. SelectMDx is available in the US and all EU member states. Since the introduction of the SelectMDx test in mid-2016, over 23,000 patients have been tested and 15 commercial contracts have been signed with US based insurance companies. The test has been included in the 2018 European Association of Urology (EAU) clinical guidelines.\n\nAbout MDxHealth®\n\nMDxHealth is a multinational healthcare company that provides actionable molecular diagnostic information to personalize the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

Kopans, director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and a radiology professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nLast November, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force spurred dissension among breast cancer experts with controversial new guidelines for breast cancer screening. The task force recommended that women begin having screening mammograms at age 50 -- not 40 -- and that those exams occur every other year, instead of annually.\n\nBut some cancer organizations reject the panel\'s advice. The American Cancer Society still recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40, as long as a woman is still in good health.\n\nOn Tuesday, the American College of Radiology (ACR), the Society of Breast Imaging and the American Society of Breast Disease launched ""Mammography Saves Lives,"" a campaign designed to encourage women to have an annual mammogram starting at age 40.\n\n""Mammography is not perfect; no one has claimed that it is,"" said Kopans, a member of the ACR Commission on Breast Imaging. But since the advent of routine mammograms in the 1990s, the rate of death from breast cancer has dropped 30 percent, he observed.\n\n""That\'s a huge achievement,"" Kopans noted, adding that ""it may not be a big deal to an epidemiologist who\'s looking at huge numbers and doesn\'t take care of women with breast problems.""\n\nNorway\'s breast cancer screening program began in 1996 and was expanded two years later, with staggered enrollment by county over a period of nine years. Since 2005, all Norwegian women aged 50 to 69 have been invited to have a screening mammogram every two years, the authors said.\n\nFor the study, more than 40,000 Norwegian women were followed for an average of 2.2 years. Researchers compared death rates from breast cancer among four groups of women: two that were living in counties with or without screening and two groups that lived in the same counties before screening was offered.\n\nThe difference in the rate of death from breast cancer among women in the screening group versus the control group was 28 percent. In comparison, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death in the non-screened group versus the control group, the study found.\n\nIn other words, breast cancer screening was associated with a reduction in death -- but only accounted for 10 percentage points of the difference.\n\n""Our observed 10 percent reduction in death from breast cancer is much lower than previously thought,"" Kalager said. ""It is plausible that today, the effect of increased breast awareness and improved therapy have outweighed the effect of screening on reducing mortality from breast cancer.""\n\nBoth Kopans and Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the American Cancer Society\'s chief medical officer, criticized the research team\'s short follow-up period -- just 2.2 years of observation, on average. They both said that the time frame was insufficient to assess the effect of screening.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine and community and family medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in Lebanon, N.H., said the Norwegian study helps to confirm that the decision to undergo screening mammography is ""a close call.""\n\nWelch, author of a book, Should I Be Tested for Cancer? Maybe Not and Here\'s Why, suggested that with better treatment and increased awareness of the importance of seeking care for breast abnormalities, screening mammography may be less important now than in the past.\n\n""That physicians are still debating the relative merits of screening mammography despite the wealth of data suggests that the test is surely a close call, a delicate balance between modest benefit and modest harm,"" Welch wrote.\n\nBut Kopans noted that mammography is still the only test that has been proven to reduce the death rate from breast cancer and that this study should not divert attention away from that fact.\n\n""It\'s clearly muddying the waters,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about screening mammograms by visiting the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A fairly complete reporting of the Norwegian mammography study.  But one of its strengths – its sourcing – also became a weakness when the amount of space given one conflicted critic threw the story out of balance. </span>","This story does a fairly good job carefully walking readers through a new study on a highly charged topic: the benefits of mammography.

At the moment, testing often requires costly and complex equipment that can take a couple of days to produce a result,” said Graham Cooke, who co-led the research from the Imperial’s department of medicine.\n\n“We have taken the job done by this equipment, which is the size of a large photocopier, and shrunk it down to a USB chip.”\n\nThe test, which uses a mobile phone chip, requires a drop of blood to be placed onto a spot on the USB stick. Any HIV in the sample triggers an acidity change, which the chip transforms into an electrical signal. This is sent to the USB stick, which shows the result on a computer or electronic device.\n\nPublished in the journal Scientific Reports, results showed the stick test was 95 percent accurate over 991 blood samples, and the average time to produce a reading was 20.8 minutes.\n\nSome 36 million people worldwide are infected with the human deficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, and the majority of them live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nCurrent AIDS drugs, called anti-retrovirals, reduce virus levels in a patients blood to near zero.\n\nBut in some cases the drugs stop working - sometimes because virus has developed resistance to them - and the first sign of that would be a rise in a patient’s so-called “viral load”.\n\nVirus levels can’t be detected by routine HIV tests, which can only show whether or not a person has the virus.']","These inaccurate news stories could very well stoke false hope among HIV field workers and their patients, and further erode public trust in news media.","Via Imperial College London and DNA Electronics
This Reuters story draws readers in with news that scientists have developed a quick HIV test on a USB stick, which could be useful in the developing world.
While the story hints at the underlying method —a unique lab-on-a-chip test to estimate the amount of HIV in a person—it glazes over the study’s two-test design. And it’s a big miss: The story confuses the effectiveness of the traditional, test tube-based method with that of the experimental USB stick test that researchers hope will replace it, ultimately overstating the latter’s sensitivity. The reason this happened is because it seems to be based entirely on a news release, which also seems to misunderstand the study’s design.

The paper from a team led by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators describes patient outcomes an average of seven years after proton therapy for medulloblastoma, a fast-growing tumor that develops in the cerebellum at the base of the brain.\n\n""Proton radiotherapy is still not widely available in the U.S. or around the world, but it is increasingly recognized for its potential to reduce the side effects of treatment, particularly in the pediatric population,"" says Torunn Yock, MD, MCh, MGH Department of Radiation Oncology, lead and corresponding author of the report. ""At experienced centers, proton therapy has a proven track record of treatment success and safety.""\n\nIn contrast to photon radiotherapy, in which a dose of radiation is delivered all along the x-ray beam as it passes through a patient\'s body, in proton therapy the dose is precisely focused on the target area with little or no dose delivered to normal tissues in front of or behind the tumor. This feature has made proton therapy particularly attractive to treat tumors in or near the brain or eyes, areas where the protection of nearby healthy tissues is particularly critical.\n\nWhile medulloblastoma can often be successfully treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, because of its location within the brain, long-term side effects are common. These can include hearing loss, which can be particularly problematic in young children; problems with learning and memory, and neuroendocrine disorders caused by irradiation of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus. Also commonly seen are problems affecting the heart, lungs, thyroid, spine and reproductive organs, all of which tend to be more serious in children treated at younger ages.\n\nWhile proton therapy may appear to be ideal for reducing these adverse effects, no previous study had prospectively examined the long-term results of children treated for medulloblastoma with proton therapy. To investigate their hypothesis that proton therapy would reduce the incidence and severity of side effects without loss of treatment effectiveness, the researchers enrolled children and adolescents ages 3 to 21 - with an average age of around 6 ½ - who received proton therapy for medulloblastoma at the MGH from 2003 to 2009. All had previous surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and all received chemotherapy before, during or after proton therapy.\n\nStudy participants were tested for hearing, a variety of cognitive functions, levels of important hormones and height and weight at the outset of the study and at several follow-up visits for up to eight years. Of 59 patients who enrolled, 12 died from their tumor during the study period and one from a traumatic brain injury. Significant hearing loss was seen in 12 percent of patients three years after treatment and in 16 percent at five years, which compares with around 25 percent reported in studies using photon radiotherapy. The cognitive effects of proton therapy - primarily affecting verbal comprehension and processing speed - were also less serious than what has been reported with photon radiotherapy, and those effects were primarily seen in children who were under the age of 8 when treated.\n\nThe neuroendocrine effects of proton therapy - deficits in any hormone level were seen in 63 percent of participants seven years after treatment - were similar to what has been reported with photon therapy. However, no cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, seizure or secondary tumor effects - all of which have been reported in photon therapy studies - were seen in the current study\'s participants. Survival rates and the incidence and type of tumor recurrence all were similar to what has been reported for photon radiotherapy.\n\n""Our results indicate that proton therapy maintains excellent cure rates in pediatric medulloblastoma while reducing long-term side effects, particularly in hearing and neurocognitive function, and eliminating cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal and reproductive effects,"" says Yock, who is an associate professor of Radiation Oncology at Harvard Medical School. ""While we are currently investigating quality of life differences between proton and photon treatment, I truly believe that - particularly for the youngest children - the ability to offer them proton therapy can make a big difference in their lives.""\n\n###\n\nNancy J.

The premise of the study and its follow-up release is that proton beam therapy, by damaging less normal brain tissue, leaves a young patent with fewer long-term future complications from side effects.
The study, published in Lancet Oncology, reports on the follow-up of 59 children treated at one institution with proton beam therapy between 2003 and 2009. The release imparts a lot of information about the complicated study in a brief, readable way, but we have several concerns with missing information and implied results. All of the patients in the study had additional treatments including surgery and chemotherapy, so the benefits and harms cannot be fully attributed to the proton beam therapy. The release also does not address costs (which are significantly higher than standard therapy) or a very important limitation explained in the study which is that, for ethical reasons, there is no randomized control group treated in a similar way except for receiving conventional radiation therapy.

Before researchers try a compound on humans, it’s tested at labs in petri dishes and on animals, such as mice and monkeys. More often than not, these studies produce mixed data that don’t tell researchers much about whether it is safe and effective for humans.\n\nFor some time, scientists have been searching for ways to cut down on the cost and failure rate of drug testing. Researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have developed a beautiful solution: Organs-On-Chips.\n\nThe clear and flexible polymer microchips are lined with human cells. Each one represents a different human organ system, such as lungs, heart and intestines. The institute’s goal is to create 10 different organ systems that can be joined together by blood vessel channels to simulate human physiology on a microscale and provide a cheaper, more reliable way to test new drugs.\n\nTry Newsweek for only $1.25 per week\n\nThe sophisticated architecture of these organs-on-chips—which are about the size of a thumb drive—has also earned the Wyss Institute recognition in the art world with a Design of the Year award from the Design Museum and placement in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection.\n\n“The real power of this approach is that you have a window to the inner workings of life,” says Don Ingber, founding director of the Wyss Institute and a professor of Vascular Biology and of Bioengineering at Harvard University. “Anything you can ask at the molecular level, we could do in our chips.”\n\nIn 2008, the team built and tested its first “organoid” chip to mimic the mechanical function of human lungs. It contains tiny channels separated by a porous membrane to create two distinct, hollow passageways—one lined with human lung cells and the other with capillary blood vessel cells. Air is suctioned through the side channels to emulate breathing. Ingber and his team introduced bacteria into the chip’s lung channel and white blood cells into the capillary channel. They observed that the white blood cells permeated the membrane and attacked the bacteria in the lung cell channel—exactly what would happen in human lungs fighting off an infection.\n\nIn another experiment, the team at Wyss filled a chip’s lung cell channel with interleukin 2, a chemotherapy drug known to cause pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. When air entered the lung cell channel, the channel filled with fluid and then blood clots—exactly what happens in the lungs of patients who develop this life-threatening condition. This proved the chips could provide real world information to scientists studying the effects of new drug compounds.\n\nThe project has received support from the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency also recently awarded the institute a $37 million grant to create chips representing nearly all systems in the body. Ingber says some scientists are interested in using the chips to conduct research that would be unethical if performed on people, such as studying the effects of gamma radiation on the human body.\n\nOf course, the chips have limitations. “We can’t mimic consciousness; we can’t mimic compression on a joint,” says Ingber.\n\nDanilo Tagle, associate director for special initiatives at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, a division of the NIH, is spearheading a similar organ-on-chip project. He suspects that in the beginning the chips will be used to “complement and supplement” animal studies, but will eventually become routine practice. The chips will also provide researchers with information on dosing at a much earlier stage in drug studies—particularly helpful because animals metabolize chemical substances at a different rate than humans. “You can go forward with a candidate drug with greater assurance and confidence that it will have the desired effect on humans,” says Tagle. “Biology is very complex.”\n\nIncorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research. Some companies are already trying out the concept. Janssen Pharmaceuticals Company, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is using a version of the chips to understand how blood clots in the lungs. The information is essential to reduce the risk for this side effect of oncology drugs.\n\nThough there still aren’t enough data to prove the chips are reliable enough to put rodents out of a job, Ingber says it’s only a matter of time; they hope to have them tested and ready for market in two years. “The FDA has been very supportive,” he says. “They’ve told us if they are as good as animals that they would consider accepting data provided by a drug company from one of these models rather than an animal model.”']","This story is about a promising new technology that may one day replace animal studies for the testing of new therapeutics. It’s a reasonable exploration of the topic, but needed an independent voice to weigh in with more critical analysis.","Will new technology reduce the need for animal testing?
This Newsweek story addresses an important topic with plenty of research and reporting. It tells how new chip-based technology that models human organs could potentially replace animal studies as a means of testing new drug candidates — possibly leading to cheaper and faster approvals. But while there’s a reasonable exploration of the evidence and some caution about the early state of the technology, the story feels unbalanced. The story only quotes researchers with a vested interest in the success of the technology, and its language describing potential benefits gets a little ahead of the evidence in places. Inclusion of an independent source with expertise in this area probably would have helped with many of these concerns. We make some other suggestions for improvement below in our review comments.

In some cases, the cause is unclear. Patients can also experience other uncomfortable symptoms, including vomiting, headaches and motion sickness.\n\nFor the study, researchers recruited 338 people who had vertigo with an unknown cause. Some had attacks rarely, maybe once a year. Others had them two to three times a week. Participants also developed nausea, headaches and could not tolerate head movements during the attacks.\n\nTo diagnose the new vertigo, the researchers had patients sit in a dark room. They then moved each patient\'s head forward and shook it from side to side for about 15 seconds.\n\nAfterwards, a video recorded the patients\' eye movements. The researchers noticed that uncontrolled eye movements, called nystagmus, lasted longer in people with this new form of vertigo.\n\nThe findings were published online May 23 in Neurology.\n\n""It\'s possible that the vertigo occurs when this unstable mechanism is disrupted by factors either within the person\'s body or in their environment,"" Kim said in a journal news release.\n\nThis new form of the condition is called recurrent spontaneous vertigo with head-shaking nystagmus. Thirty-five study participants had this form of vertigo.\n\nThey were compared to 35 others whose vertigo is triggered by other conditions, including the inner ear disorder Meniere\'s disease. Those with the newly identified form of vertigo experienced uncontrolled eye movements for 12 seconds -- twice as long as those with Meniere\'s and five seconds longer than those with vestibular migraine and another inner ear disorder called vestibular neuritis.\n\nThose with the new form of vertigo were also more likely to have severe motion sickness than those with other forms of the condition, the study showed.\n\nPreventative medication was given to 20 of the 35 people with the newly detected type of vertigo. Of these, one-third saw their symptoms reduced or they recovered completely.\n\nThe researchers followed the new vertigo patients for an average of 12 years. Five had no more attacks, 14 had an improvement in their condition, and only one person had a worsening of symptoms. The others\' outcomes were not revealed.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine provides more on vertigo.']",The story should have provided some counter-balance to this viewpoint — is it really a new diagnosis?,"This HealthDay story reports on a study published in the journal of the American Academy of Neurology where researchers claim to have discovered a new form of vertigo, a condition causing dizziness. They found a small subgroup within a population of vertigo patients whose response differed from those of patients with known forms of the condition.
The story is barely more than a rewrite of the news release sent out by the AAN. With no independent sources, it doesn’t critically explore the question of whether this is really a new diagnosis, or only a subgroup of vertigo patients who had a particular finding on a special examination.

This message was brought to you by the American Egg Board.\n\nThat’s right – the folks who sell eggs paid for a study that comes to the shocking conclusion that eggs are an ideal breakfast food. They could have just asked people if they liked eating eggs for breakfast.\n\nInstead, they recruited 20 volunteers who were overweight or obese and assigned them to a week of either egg breakfasts or ready-to-eat cereal breakfasts. After a two-week gap, the groups were switched. Both types of breakfasts had the same number of calories, but the egg breakfasts contained “higher protein quality,” according to an abstract for the study, posted online here.\n\nThe folks who carried out this egg industry-funded research were from the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La. This place conducts some serious research on diet and weight. So to assess whether people who ate egg breakfasts were better off than their counterparts who ate cereal, they took blood samples and measured the concentration of two key hunger hormones: acylated ghrelin (which stimulates hunger) and PYY3-36 (which is how the intestines let the brain know that you’re full). Sure enough, in the week when they ate eggs, volunteers had lower acylated ghrelin and higher PYY3-36 compared with the week when they ate cereal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers also treated the volunteers to four buffet lunches. They weren’t just being nice – researchers kept track of how much food everyone ate. They found that volunteers ate smaller lunches after they ate egg breakfasts compared with when they ate cereal breakfasts. The reason: They were less hungry.\n\nThe study was presented Saturday at the European Congress on Obesity in France by Nikhil Dhurandhar, a biochemist who studies obesity at Pennington.

But, while we agree that the story should have pointedly identified the funding source for this research and explained the potential for bias that might result, that doesn’t mean the study results should be dismissed merely because the research was industry supported. The study seems to have been reasonably well conducted — if inadequately described in the abstract and very limited in what its conclusions can tell us. That’s where the real emphasis could have been placed.  This is also not a new notion – related research has looked at the quality of breakfast food choices and later hunger/eating behaviors.

Levels of NAD+ diminish with age, and it has been suggested that loss of this metabolite may play a role in age-related health decline.\n\nThese findings in animal studies have spurred people to take commercially available NR supplements designed to boost NAD+. However, these over-the-counter supplements have not undergone clinical trials to see if they work in people.\n\nThe new research, reported Oct. 10 in the journal Nature Communications, was led by Charles Brenner, PhD, professor and Roy J. Carver Chair of Biochemistry at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in collaboration with colleagues at Queens University Belfast and ChromaDex Corp. (NASDAQ: CDXC), which supplied the NR used in the trial. Brenner is a consultant for ChromaDex. He also is co-founder and Chief Scientific Adviser of ProHealthspan, which sells NR supplements under the trade name Tru NIAGEN®.\n\nThe human trial involved six men and six women, all healthy. Each participant received single oral doses of 100 mg, 300 mg, or 1,000 mg of NR in a different sequence with a seven-day gap between doses. After each dose, blood and urine samples were collected and analyzed by Brenner\'s lab to measure various NAD+ metabolites in a process called metabolomics. The trial showed that the NR vitamin increased NAD+ metabolism by amounts directly related to the dose, and there were no serious side effects with any of the doses.\n\n""This trial shows that oral NR safely boosts human NAD+ metabolism,"" Brenner says. ""We are excited because everything we are learning from animal systems indicates that the effectiveness of NR depends on preserving and/or boosting NAD+ and related compounds in the face of metabolic stresses. Because the levels of supplementation in mice that produce beneficial effects are achievable in people, it appears than health benefits of NR will be translatable to humans safely.""\n\nThe next step will be to study the effect of longer duration NR supplementation on NAD+ metabolism in healthy adults, but Brenner also has plans to test the effects of NR in people with diseases and health conditions, including elevated cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, and people at risk for chemotherapeutic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSelf-study precedes clinical trial\n\nPrior to the formal clinical trial, Brenner conducted a pilot human study - on himself. In 2004, he had discovered that NR is a natural product found in milk and that there is pathway to convert NR to NAD+ in people. More than a decade of research on NR metabolic pathways and health effects in mice and rats had convinced him that NR supplementation had real promise to improve human health and wellness. After consulting with UI\'s institutional review board, he conducted an experiment in which he took 1 gram of NR once a day for seven days, and his team analyzed blood and urine samples using mass spectrometry. The experiment showed that Brenner\'s blood NAD+ increased by about 2.7 times. In addition, though he reported immediate sensitivity to flushing with the related compound niacin, he did not experience any side effects taking NR.\n\nThe biggest surprise from his metabolomic analysis was an increase in a metabolite called NAAD, which was multiplied by 45 times, from trace levels to amounts in the micromolar range that were easily detectable.\n\n""While this was unexpected, I thought it might be useful,"" Brenner says. ""NAD+ is an abundant metabolite and it is sometimes hard to see the needle move on levels of abundant metabolites. But when you can look at a low-abundance metabolite that goes from undetectable to easily detectable, there is a great signal to noise ratio, meaning that NAAD levels could be a useful biomarker for tracking increases in NAD+ in human trials.""\n\nBrenner notes this was a case of bidirectional translational science; having learned something from the initial human experiment, his team was able to return to laboratory mice to explore the unexpected NAAD finding in more detail.\n\nFirst mice, then men and women\n\nBrenner\'s mouse study showed that NAAD is formed from NR and confirmed that NAAD levels are a strong biomarker for increased NAD+ metabolism. The experiments also revealed more detail about NAD+ metabolic pathways.\n\nIn particular, the researchers compared the ability of all three NAD+ precursor vitamins - NR, niacin, and nicotinamide - to boost NAD+ metabolism and stimulate the activity of certain enzymes, which have been linked to longevity and health benefits. The study showed for the first time that oral NR is superior to nicotinamide, which is better than niacin in terms of the total amount of NAD+ produced at an equivalent dose. NR was also the best of the three in stimulating the activity of sirtuin enzymes. However, in this case, NR was the best at stimulating sirtuin-like activities, followed by niacin, followed by nicotinamide.\n\nThe information from the mouse study subsequently helped Brenner\'s team design the formal clinical trial. In addition to showing that NR boosts NAD+ in humans without adverse effects, the trial confirmed that NAAD is a highly sensitive biomarker of NR supplementation in people.\n\n""Now that we have demonstrated safety in this small clinical trial, we are in a position to find out if the health benefits that we have seen in animals can be reproduced in people,"" says Brenner, who also is co-director of the Obesity Research and Education Initiative, professor of internal medicine, and a member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center at the UI.\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Brenner, the research team included lead study author Samuel Trammell, Mark Schmidt, Benjamin Weidemann, Zhonggang Li, and E. Dale Abel at the UI Carver College of Medicine; Philip Redpath and Marie Migaud at Queens University Belfast; Frank Jaksch at ChromaDex in Irvine, Calif, and Ryan Dellinger, formerly at ChromaDex.\n\nThe research was funded in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the Roy J. Carver Trust, and ChromaDex.']",This news release infers benefits that have yet to be proven in people.,"This news release describes a 12-person safety trial of a nicotinamide riboside (NR), a dietary supplement that has been found to boost a coenzyme called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which declines in humans as they age. The news release deserves credit for pointing out researchers’ financial conflicts. It also states that there have been no clinical trials to determine whether NR produces any actual health benefits. But that caveat comes after a misleading headline and first paragraph that assert the substance increases levels of a cell metabolite “linked to multiple health benefits” without mentioning these benefits have only been shown to occur in mice. Also, it doesn’t seem fair to characterize this as “new research” as the news release states, since the manufacturer announced these safety findings last year.

The firm, which markets itself as “The Women’s Health Company,” makes other products, including a 2-D digital mammography machine, a test that assesses risk of preterm labor, gynecological products, including Adiana (a permanent contraception technique), and widely used equipment that measures bone density. But 3-D mammography could become its flagship, because for the moment it owns the entire market – although other companies, including powerhouse GE, are developing their own 3-D machines, Hologic is the only one with FDA approval thus far. Of course, given the sluggish economy and the continuing state of uncertainty around American health care, persuading hospitals to upgrade may be challenging. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the company’s PowerPoint presentation to the FDA included the unsubtle phrase “huge breakthrough,” or that the first American patient to undergo 3-D mammography – Laura Lang, a polished 55-year-old Boston marketing executive and breast cancer survivor – did so in front of a CBS camera crew last February.\n\nIndeed they do. They’re catching on like – well, it’s not a slow burn. The device earned Food and Drug Administration approval on February 11, and for a short time it was available only at MGH. Now it is available in at least nine states, three of which have multiple sites, and most of the several dozen hospitals around the United States that assisted with clinical trials are planning to buy systems, too. The images aren’t the only selling point. The early data are compelling as well. In studies presented to the FDA, radiologists reported a 7 percent improvement in their ability to distinguish cancerous from noncancerous cases when they used the new system. If that sounds unimpressive, consider that 39 million women are screened each year; any significant reduction in callbacks for additional testing would mean hundreds of thousands of women would be spared painful, and expensive, follow-up.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Rafferty is trying not to lapse into rhapsodic cliches. “I don’t want to call it a magic bullet, because that would oversell,” she says. “It’s not a panacea.” Then, five minutes later: “I don’t want to say it’s catching on like wildfire.” After a few minutes more, though, Rafferty can’t help herself. She lets her enthusiasm loose. “People have been waiting for it for a long time,” she says. “It’s a step, but it’s a step by a person who has a stride of 7 feet.” “It” is a 3-D mammography machine, the Selenia Dimensions system, one of which sits in the breast imaging clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital that Rafferty, a radiologist, runs. The machine, which is made by the Bedford company Hologic and developed partly at MGH under Rafferty’s supervision, produces images that are so vivid and clear they seem to speak out loud: “Hey, right here! This is a tumor!” If you look at enough of them, you may become convinced that you don’t need medical training to spot a case of breast cancer or distinguish a false positive on a mammogram from a true one. The distinction seems that clear. “If you can tell the difference as a non-radiologist, imagine how a radiologist feels,” says Rafferty. “The images sort of sell themselves.”\n\nMuch of the criticism focused on the data the task force had used to make its decision, which consisted largely of the results from prospective, randomized clinical trials conducted in the United States. Trials like this are the gold standard of medical evidence. They are also expensive and time-consuming, and thus hard to come by. The most recent such trial looking at mammography and mortality in the United States was published in the 1980s. “A lot of the people on the task force are my friends, and I have tremendous respect for them, but this was a big point where we differed,” says Brawley. “The standard type of mammography that’s used all over the country today may very well be better than what was used in that trial. So the outcomes may be better, too.” The studies the task force had chosen to examine showed that screening beginning at age 40 had little impact on mortality while at the same time generating a significant number of false positives. Those data were complete and comprehensive. But, says Brawley, they were outdated.\n\nThe task force wasn’t expecting a firestorm. That, however, was what it got. Breast cancer advocacy groups mutinied, saying the guidelines would cause significant numbers of women to go undiagnosed for years, some of them fatally. Politicians started giving scary speeches about rationing health care. Many radiologists – including the MGH department as a whole – rejected the new guidelines. Daniel Kopans, a world leader in breast imaging (he wrote the textbook of that name) and a radiologist at MGH, now says that the panel didn’t “understand mammography screening.” Furthermore, he adds, the new guidelines had “no biological or scientific reason” behind them.\n\nThe last time someone tried to improve the way American women are screened for breast cancer, it turned into a national debacle. In November 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed group of doctors charged with making recommendations that often influence what insurers will pay for, updated its guidelines for mammography. Previously, it had advised women to begin annual or biannual screening at 40. The new guidelines pushed that age to 50, emphasizing that starting earlier should be an individual choice.\n\nDebates about mammography are often so emotionally charged that this type of nuance goes missing. “I think some of our rhetoric – medicine’s in general, and also that of advocates?– has made people think that every metastatic breast cancer is a failure of the woman to get a mammogram or of a doctor to read a mammogram correctly,” says Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society and a professor at Emory University’s School of Medicine in Atlanta. “In reality, yes, mammography does save lives – but it is far from perfect. It’s not as good as many people think it is.” So if the new 3-D mammography isn’t perfect, just how good is it?\n\nBut the company, and the rest of us, should be careful not to overhype 3-D mammography. As Rafferty says, it’s not a panacea. The technology does come with costs, financial and medical. A fully equipped 3-D machine runs on average $474,541, not including the annual service fee Hologic charges for maintenance, and even hospitals that already own an upgradeable 2-D system made by Hologic have to pay about $125,000 to get it adapted for 3-D use. There are also costs in the sense of risks: Women who get a combo 2-D and 3-D mammogram, the protocol that confers the most dramatic jump in benefits, are exposed to twice as much X-ray radiation as the norm (albeit still an amount that’s under the FDA’s permitted limit). And no one yet knows if the new technique will actually save lives.\n\nIs Hologic's 3-D mammography machine likely to fare better? There are reasons to think it will. Unlike MRI, which requires an injection with contrast dye and an hour in the imaging machine, it isn’t an ordeal – or at least it’s no worse than a conventional mammogram. (Yes, you still have to endure the dreaded clamp.) And it seems to be more effective than its most similar precursor, the 2-D digital technique. Early data from Rafferty’s trial showed that the same group of women who did benefit from 2-D digital benefited even more dramatically from 3-D. (It’s worth noting that this is not a small group of people. Fifty percent of women are in what the American Cancer Society considers the “intermediate zone” of risk, which overlaps considerably with the group that saw some benefit in DMIST.) Perhaps more important, even the women who didn’t see any improvement in accuracy with 2-D get a small boost with 3-D over film. And 3-D seems to be both more sensitive and more specific – improvement in one area doesn’t have to come at the cost of the other.\n\nBut when the definitive trial of 2-D digital techniques, called DMIST, was published in 2005, tracking nearly 50,000 patients, it didn’t provide the answers that advocates had been expecting. Digital mammography did seem to perform more accurately than film in women who were younger than 50, women who were pre- or perimenopausal, and women with dense breast tissue. But when all women were considered as a group, that benefit disappeared. On the whole, it turned out, digital just didn’t live up to the way it had been sold.\n\nWhen 2-D digital mammography was introduced in 2000, doctors hoped it would vault over those problems. (Well, most of them. The cost concern was still present: Digital mammography machines were five times as expensive as film ones.) The marketing materials suggested it already had. An ad for GE’s 2-D digital system that ran during the Summer Olympics called it a “major new breakthrough in the fight against breast cancer.” Digital technology, the thinking went, would show nuances that film never could, because it could render, literally, many more shades of gray.\n\nThe problem, however, was that each time they introduced a new imaging tool for breast cancer, they found that they could not advance on one front without taking a step backward on the other. “First there was ultrasound,” says Rafferty. “We did find more cancers, but we also found so many false positives that it was untenable.” Then there was MRI, which had the same problem – and it was 10 times more expensive than mammography.\n\nRafferty had already been running trials of 3-D mammography for two years when the task force’s guidelines came out. She understood its concern about false positives – she was trying to address it, herself, albeit in a very different way. In fact, technology developers had been trying in various ways for years to increase mammography’s sensitivity (its ability to flag possible cases of cancer) while also increasing its specificity (its ability to filter out the false positives).\n\nThere’s an intuitive argument for why 3-D mammography might be more accurate. The technique works a little like a CT scan does; it takes 15 pictures of the breast at slightly different angles, then fuses them into a single synthesized image. If breast cancers were spherical in shape, they’d look basically the same in all 15 images, or, for that matter, on a conventional 2-D picture. But they’re very rarely shaped that way in reality. “In the breast, in particular, cancer cells tend to creep out single-file along the architecture of the body,” says Rafferty. “And that makes some of them especially hard to see on a [2-D] mammogram. They look like distortions, not blobs.” There’s another thing about cancer that is much clearer on a 3-D mammogram: spicules, or thin, spidery tentacles emerging from the center of a tumor. 2-D images, when taken from the wrong angle, are often too fuzzy to show them. In 3-D, however, the spicules are visible in high resolution – and seeing them is critical, since they are a hallmark of malignancy.\n\nTo Rafferty, the existing data are persuasive enough. “I own no stock in Hologic. I have no financial ties to them. And I was skeptical of this idea at first. You think to yourself, it is that simple? That elegant?” she says. “But this really does address the fundamental flaw of mammography. I want every woman to have access to this technology. I got my sisters down here when it was approved. I was like, ‘You’re all going to get this!’ Because in my heart I know it’s better.”\n\nAndy Smith, Hologic’s vice president of imaging science, is similarly hopeful. “It’s expected to improve the cancer detection rate. It is going to reduce the recall rate,” he says, referring to suspicious findings that require women to return for follow-up tests, some of which turn out to be false alarms. “And we will have more numbers on that within one to two years.” This last part, at least, is very likely true. Mammography is heavily regulated, and clinics are required to send their recall statistics – the number of women they call back for second looks – to the federal government. The data on whether 3-D will save more lives than 2-D may not be known immediately. But they will exist.\n\nHowever, the most meaningful data – the numbers that would show whether 3-D mammography saves women’s lives – won’t be available for decades. Only a prospective, randomized trial with mortality as its “endpoint” can say for sure, and that’s how long it takes to conduct one. Smith knows that that’s the reality. “We are expecting a reduction in morbidity and mortality, but we won’t know that for a long time,” he says. “You know, this technology has only been approved for two months.”\n\nBy the time such data do come out, mammography will surely have changed again. There are already efforts to augment it with contrast dyes, to develop a complementary tool called a “gamma camera,” and to augment imperfect human judgment by refining computer programs that can spot tumors as well as a radiologist might.\n\nWhat this means is that the next time the US Preventive Services Task Force or anyone else wants to take a hard look at mammography, the data it has will once again be outdated. It’s inevitable. Three-D mammography may very well be more accurate than 2-D. It may see more cancers and fewer impostors. But whether it’s truly a “huge breakthrough” by the metric that matters most is a question that can’t currently be answered – and that may be irrelevant by the time it can be. Rafferty may know “in her heart” that 3-D is better. But right now, at least, that’s the only way she truly can.\n\nMary Carmichael is a member of the Globe staff.

The researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype, known as uterine serous carcinoma.\n\nUterine serous carcinoma makes up less than 10 percent of all cancers of the endometrium, or lining of the womb, diagnosed in the United States each year, but it accounts for more than a third of the 10,000 endometrial cancer deaths annually. The aggressive carcinomas often don\'t cause symptoms until they\'ve begun to spread throughout the body. As a result, the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreading--known as progression-free survival--is only about eight months.\n\n""The fact that these tumors grow rapidly, but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early, is a double whammy for women,"" says Amanda Fader, M.D., associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and first author of the new study.\n\nFader and her colleagues knew that about 30 percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for HER2/neu, a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about 10 percent of all breast cancers. Trastuzumab binds to and blocks HER2/neu, keeping it from driving tumor growth, and has been shown to be effective in so-called HER2 positive breast cancers.\n\nFrom August 2011 through March 2017, Fader, Alessandro Santin, M.D., professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Yale University, and collaborators at 11 other cancer treatment centers in the U.S. randomly assigned 61 women with uterine serous carcinoma, being seen at the participating institutions, to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimen--a combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel--or those drugs plus trastuzumab. Some 41 of the patients had stage 3 or 4 uterine serous carcinoma--known as advanced disease--and 17 had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma. All tested positive for the HER2/neu receptor.\n\nAmong all patients, the 28 controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progression-free survival time of eight months, and the 30 who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progression-free survival time of 12.6 months. However, the difference was even more profound in the 41 patients with advanced disease, whose progression-free survival time went from an average of 9.3 months to 17.9 months with the addition of trastuzumab.\n\n""Even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers,"" says Fader, who is also affiliated with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.\n\nAmong patients with recurrent disease, progression-free survival time increased from an average of six months to 9.2 months. The difference, Fader says, may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past, are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors, or tumors with different levels of HER2 expression.\n\nFollow-up studies of the women who remain alive--who now number 35--continue, the researchers say, to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression. But the results of the trial, they add, were strong enough to warrant submission to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country.\n\nFader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination, or other combinations, is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more. She notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express HER2/neu is part of a broader trend at Johns Hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy, or precision medicine, based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients.\n\n###\n\nOther authors of the paper are Dana M.

Increasingly, months of progression-free survival — not overall survival — is reported as the clinical trial endpoint. But taking into account harms and costs, is that cause for celebration?","The release focuses on a small, phase 2 study which evaluated the use of the drug trastuzumab in conjunction with conventional chemotherapy to treat women who have been diagnosed with a form of cancer called uterine serous carcinoma (USC). The release does a good job of describing the study and articulating the limited nature of the benefits — it appears to limit cancer growth for some months, but is not a cure.
The release’s headline is misleading when it claims the new combo “improves survival” and neglects to clarify that progression-free survival may not translate to improved overall survival.
In addition, the release does not address cost or delve into specific harms. Although it mentions the disease is rare, the release could have stressed even more that few patients have the characteristics necessary to make this treatment a viable option.

Since 2004 it had shown early promise for Alzheimer\'s, which afflicts some five million Americans.\n\nIn the new study, four patients with a mild to moderate form of the disease who had been taking an IVIG drug for three years saw their cognitive ability and behavior stabilize, meaning their symptoms didn\'t get worse, said Norman Relkin, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York who presented the findings at the Alzheimer\'s Association International Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nThe finding is striking because people diagnosed with Alzheimer\'s typically see dramatic memory declines within 18 months, if not much sooner.\n\nThe patients in the study used a version of IVIG from Baxter International BAX 0.76% Inc. called Gammagard. The results suggest Gammagard ""is a viable long-term therapy in this group"" of Alzheimer\'s patients, said Dr. Relkin.\n\nThese new data represent the longest follow-up to date on patients from Baxter\'s midstage clinical trial. Earlier results were encouraging enough to prompt the company in 2007 to move Gammagard into late-stage testing for Alzheimer\'s. Results from this phase III testing are expected in early 2013.\n\nWilliam Thies, chief medical and scientific officer of the Alzheimer\'s Association, a group that funds research into the disease, called the findings ""tantalizing"" but said more work is needed. Dr. Thies wasn\'t involved in the study.\n\nIt is important to be cautious about the results due to the small sample size and because patients and investigators knew the patients were getting the medicine, which could have influenced the findings, said Rudy Tanzi, a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\n""We have to wait for a proper phase III [trial] before we reach a conclusion,"" said Dr. Tanzi, who wasn\'t involved in the study. ""It\'s almost like a crapshoot; it\'s just too small to predict.""\n\nNevertheless, doctors who work with Alzheimer\'s patients said they expect patients and families to clamor for the drug. Many said they have been asked about Gammagard for years, and this latest positive result is likely to bring an increase.\n\nIn February, when results in mice were published suggesting that a skin-cancer drug, bexarotene, was beneficial for Alzheimer\'s, many patients or their families started calling their doctors to ask whether they should use it off-label.\n\nA spokesman for Baxter said the company ""does not support the use of its therapies for unapproved indications. Further, it remains difficult to monitor the use of our IG products for Alzheimer\'s disease.""\n\nDrugs must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for specific uses, but doctors can prescribe them for other purposes. With any off-label use, there are concerns about safety and efficacy. With Gammagard, there is an additional concern about supply.\n\nIVIG is costly and difficult to make. Baxter, one of several companies that make it, says it takes 130 plasma donations to make enough to treat one patient with primary immunodeficiency for a year.\n\n""The findings are highly promising but nevertheless a double-edged sword due to the limited supply,"" said P. Murali Doraiswamy, an Alzheimer\'s researcher at Duke University who wasn\'t involved in the study but previously served as an adviser to Baxter. ""The growing off-label demand for Alzheimer\'s could threaten supply for immunodeficient patients.""\n\nIt isn\'t clear how the treatment helps Alzheimer\'s patients, but it appears to take advantage of antibodies from the plasma donors that combat a protein called amyloid, which clumps in the brains of people with the ailment.\n\nThe drug is approved for a number of conditions, particularly diseases of the immune system, and many patients who use it have life-threatening conditions. Multiple companies make IVIG, but only Gammagard is in advanced clinical testing for use in Alzheimer\'s.\n\nGayatri Devi, director of New York Memory Services, which treats patients with neurological conditions, has used Gammagard to treat Alzheimer\'s for about seven years. She says she started trying it after a patient\'s husband approached her in 2005 after hearing about an early clinical-trial result on TV.Dr. Devi has since treated several other patients with Gammagard, which involves lengthy office infusions every two to three weeks. She says she measures patients\' functioning before starting treatment and six months later to see whether they should continue. She began with patients whose functioning seemed to be deteriorating significantly and more recently has started treating mild patients to see if she can slow the disease progression.About 70% of her patients have responded, to varying degrees, though none as significantly as her first patient, said Dr. Devi.\n\nBut only about 5% of her patients can afford it, she said. It can cost more than $50,000 a year, and its use as an Alzheimer\'s treatment isn\'t covered by insurance.""The jury is still out [about Gammagard], but there\'s a lot of evidence that suggests that something like this seems to help a significant proportion of patients with Alzheimer\'s who currently don\'t have any other available treatments,"" said Dr. Devi.\n\nThe first patient, who had been diagnosed with the disease about eight years before she started Gammagard, had trouble walking and talking. Under Gammagard, the patient experienced impressive improvements in her language and movement, Dr. Devi said.\n\nSeveral of her patients have exhibited side effects. One developed a serious allergic reaction, two had kidney insufficiencies that reversed when they stopped and a few have had mild skin rashes that went away as they stayed on the treatment.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nTwelve patients took Gammagard for fewer than three years or were on a different dose.

Results of the study were published today (Dec. 17, 2018) in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nMeasuring less than 1 centimeter across, or about a third of the area of a U.S. penny, the tiny devices -- which are safe for use in the body and implantable via a minimally invasive procedure -- generate gentle electric pulses from the stomach\'s natural churning motions and deliver them to the vagus nerve, which links the brain and the stomach.\n\nThat gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food.\n\n""The pulses correlate with the stomach\'s motions, enhancing a natural response to help control food intake,"" says Xudong Wang, a UW-Madison professor of materials science and engineering.\n\nUnlike gastric bypass, which permanently alters the capacity of the stomach, the effects of the new devices also are reversible. When Wang and his collaborators removed the devices after 12 weeks, the study\'s rats resumed their normal eating patterns and weight bounced right back on.\n\nWang\'s device has several advantages over an existing unit that stimulates the vagus nerve for weight loss. That existing unit, ""Maestro,"" approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, administers high-frequency zaps to the vagus nerve to shut down all communication between the brain and stomach.

This release about an experimental implanted device to promote weight loss tells readers that it has been tested only in rats (though not until the third paragraph), but then it goes on to proclaim that the new device has “several advantages” over an existing FDA-approved device that also works by stimulating the vagus nerve to alter hunger perception, despite the fact that these comparative claims have not been tested. The release implies that the device could help all people who have obesity, without noting that the existing device is restricted to a subset of people.
The release makes claims of benefits that have yet to be tested and does not mention harms that similar devices cause. The study was published in Nature Communications.

Puskar/ASSOCIATED PRESS Gene J. Puskar/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nTwo new studies add substantial weight to one side of a long-running controversy over whether to give antibiotics to young children suffering from ear infections.\n\nThe ""wait and see"" approach has been enshrined in current guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. It\'s based on a slew of studies over the past couple of decades indicating that most children with ear infections get better without antibiotics. Some researchers also worry that too many prescriptions are fueling resistance to the drugs.\n\nBut the new studies, from the United States and Finland, come down firmly on the side of early antibiotic therapy for kids under age 2 or 3. Both studies, which appear today in the New England Journal of Medicine, find these kids get over painful ear infections faster, and have less severe symptoms, if they get prompt treatment with Augmentin, an inexpensive antibiotic often used to treat respiratory infections.\n\nBut there\'s a big ""if."" Study authors and other experts say doctors should be sure the child really is suffering from an ear infection before writing that prescription.\n\nMuch of the confusion, experts say, has been caused by studies that weren\'t careful enough about the diagnosis. If many children in prior studies didn\'t really have ear infections, then it\'s not surprising the antibiotics didn\'t work for them, says Dr. Jerome Klein of Boston University, who wrote an editorial that accompanies the new studies.\n\nBut here\'s the rub – diagnosing ear infections in very young children, who tend to squirm, is not easy.\n\nTo do a correct diagnosis, says Dr. Alejandro Hoberman of the University of Pittsburgh, the doctor needs to be able to see the child\'s eardrum, which may mean cleaning out earwax first. If the eardrum is red and bulging outward, that\'s a strong sign of a middle-ear infection. The bulge is most likely caused by pus from a bacterial infection that needs antibiotic treatment.\n\n""It is a two- and sometimes a three-person operation to see the eardrum,"" says Hoberman, who led the US study.\n\nDr. David Spiro of the Oregon Health Sciences University is an advocate of the wait-and-see approach to treating ear infections. He coauthored a 2006 study that supported it. But Spiro thinks ""the pendulum will swing the other way"" – that is, toward immediate antibiotic treatment – because of the new studies.\n\nSo what\'s a concerned parent to do? Hoberman says they can cut through some of the fog by asking doctors if their child has the telltale ""bulging eardrum"" sign that indicates a true ear infection.\n\nAnd, he notes, they shouldn\'t be afraid to press their pediatrician. ""How bulging is the eardrum? Is it really bulging this time? Or does it look like fluid in the ear? It\'s OK to ask the question,"" Hoberman said.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A clear, well-written summary of new research – both on the NPR blog and on the air. </span>","This well written blog post accompanied a fairly thorough on-air discussion of two new studies showing the benefits of vaccines for treating middle ear infections in young children.

Bye-Bye, Fat","['Fat cells, watch out.\n\nTwo new devices—one that deflates fat cells, one that destroys them—have just been cleared for ""body contouring"" in doctors\' offices by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nZeltiq grabs onto love handles and belly pouches and freezes the fat cells inside, causing them to self-destruct over several months. Zerona is a low-level laser that rotates around the waist, hips and thighs, forcing the fat cells to empty in a matter of weeks. In both cases, there are no incisions, no downtime and no need for anesthesia. The fat is reabsorbed by the body.\n\nSeveral other devices that claim to painlessly blast away fat with ultrasound, radio waves or lasers are already on the market or hoping for FDA approval soon. These high-tech weapons in the battle of the bulge are less invasive than liposuction—which involves loosening fat internally and vacuuming it out with a tube, a procedure that nearly 200,000 Americans had last year.\n\nOf course, there is still no magic wand for the 66% of us who are overweight or obese: Eliminating fat cells without also eating less or exercising more may make fat crop up elsewhere and ultimately do more harm than good.\n\nThat\'s because fat cells are not just passive storage depots for surplus calories. They are busy chemical factories that send signals all over the body, helping to regulate growth, puberty, healing, disease-fighting and aging. Among the 100 or more hormones that fat cells secrete are adiponectine, which helps manage metabolism, and leptin, which tells the brain to eat more or less (although the brain doesn\'t always listen).\n\nMuch about fat cells remains mysterious. They\'re among the largest and longest-living cells in the body, capable of expanding at least 64 times their original size (the upper limit is unknown). A lean adult has about 40 billion fat cells; an obese adult can have 120 billion.\n\nZerona laser Erchonia Medical Journal Community\n\nIn general, it\'s healthier to have a larger number of small fat cells than fewer, fatter ones. Subcutaneous fat cells, under the skin in places like the hips, thighs and lower belly, may be unsightly, but they are relatively benign.\n\nTheir principal work is to pull excess fat out of the bloodstream, package it and store it in big droplets—one per fat cell—until the body needs it for energy.\n\nHealthy fat cells are precisely attuned to the body\'s needs, says Michael D. Jensen, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ""When you eat too much, the fat cells store it up, and when you miss a meal, they give it back to you.""\n\nBut if fat cells aren\'t working properly, they don\'t store and release fat effectively. Harmful versions called visceral fat cells accumulate in and around organs like the heart and liver, and release fat into the bloodstream, raising the risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\nWhy some fat cells stop working, and why some proliferate while others just balloon isn\'t understood.\n\nZeltiq CoolSculpting Zeltiq\n\nHeredity clearly plays a role, as does taking in more calories than the body needs. But fat-cell function doesn\'t necessarily correlate with weight gain. Some people are able to carry 100 extra pounds and still have functioning fat cells; others run into metabolic trouble when they gain just a few pounds, according to Dr. Jensen.\n\nUntil recently, experts thought that all the body\'s fat cells were created by around age 20, and that they never died, just grew and shrunk as people gained or lost weight. But scientists at Sweden\'s Karolinska Institute recently discovered that even in lean people, about 10% of the body\'s fat cells die and are replaced each year.\n\n""The fact that the number seems to remain constant over the years indicates that something is very much regulating the number of fat cells. That\'s what I\'m interested in right now,"" says neuroscientist Kirsty Spalding, the lead researcher.\n\nThe amount and distribution of fat also changes naturally with age. ""People tend to gain subcutaneous fat through middle age, and then it starts to diminish, first on the back of the hands, then in the lower legs and elsewhere,"" says James L. Kirkland, a professor of aging at the Mayo Clinic. It piles up as visceral fat instead—and eventually appears in muscle, liver and even bone marrow, where the fat is a substitute for new bones. ""Losing subcutaneous fat is not good, paradoxically,"" Dr. Kirkland says.\n\nBlasting Fat\n\nThat\'s partly why some obesity experts are wary of the new fat-blasting techniques. The devices can\'t target visceral fat, only subcutaneous fat, and if patients continue to consume more calories than they burn, they may hasten that process of accumulating harmful fat instead.\n\nSome experts also worry that forcing fat out of fat cells can increase the level in the bloodstream.\n\n""Fat is very toxic,"" says Dr. Jensen. ""It\'s not something you want in large amounts floating around free. You want it inside a cell, protected.""\n\nAnother danger is that losing fat cells could will lower leptin levels, signaling to the brain to eat more.\n\n""That\'s one of the reasons it\'s so, so hard to maintain weight loss—the body is trying to defend a weight it got used to,"" says Mitchell Lazar, director of the Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nOfficials at Zeltiq, of Pleasanton, Calif., and Erchonia Corp., the McKinney, Texas, company that makes Zerona, say they had to demonstrate to the FDA that triglyceride levels in the body did not rise significantly after their procedures.\n\n""It\'s the equivalent of eating three to five french fries per day,"" says Mitchell Levinson, Zeltiq\'s founder and chief scientific officer.\n\nThey also say the process is gradual and involves a small percentage of the body\'s overall fat.\n\nStill, both companies stress that it\'s important for patients to change their eating and exercise lifestyle habits as well.\n\n""This is for patients who have a discreet bulge they want to get rid of,"" says Mr. Levinson. ""Your love handle will get smaller, but you won\'t lose any weight unless your change your behavior.""\n\n—Email healthjournal@wsj.com.\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com']","This well written story does a great job explaining why all fats are not created equal. It could have used a little more heft, though, in evaluating the evidence behind the devices that are the hook for the story.","This is a story that starts out with announcing the approval of two new devices for reducing a person’s waistline but then quickly takes an interesting detour through the biology of fat cells — their function, how they work, and their diversity.  The story goes on to make clear that after treatment with these devices, ""the fat is reabsorbed by the body,"" indicating that while they may bring about a change in appearance, there is no loss of weight. Through great use of independent experts the story excels where many fail by explaining that high-tech solutions to a low-tech problem may not be a wise choice. It fails in other areas, though, including any mention of costs and any evaluation of the evidence being used to promote these devices.

But they also suffered more side effects than patients not taking the medication.\n\n""The question was to see if more weight loss could be achieved if we provided decent quality lifestyle intervention, mostly dietary counseling, along with this medication,"" said study lead author Dr. Kishore Gadde, director of the Obesity Clinical Trials Program at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.\n\n""And the answer was yes,"" Gadde said.\n\nThe research, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, appears online Oct. 15 in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nFor obese men and women who can\'t control their weight through diet and lifestyle changes, nonsurgical options are limited, the study authors noted. Just a few prescription medications are approved in the United States for long-term treatment of obesity, including orlistat (brand name Xenical) and lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq).\n\nGadde and colleagues set out to follow up on a 16-week investigation they conducted in 2003 that had indicated that zonisamide (Zonegran) at a dosage of 400 milligrams a day might offer an alternative.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2011 the study team randomly assigned more than 200 obese men and women to one of three groups. One group took 200 milligrams of zonisamide daily, another got 400 mg of zonisamide daily and one received a dummy pill. The participants\' average age was 43, and their average body-mass index (BMI) was nearly 38. BMI is a calculation of body fat based on height and weight, and a BMI of more than 30 is considered obese. None had diabetes.\n\nAll study participants followed their treatment plan for one year. During this time, they all also received monthly individualized nutritional counseling, which Gadde described as ""not intensive,"" to help them reduce their overall caloric intake.\n\nThose on the higher-dose zonisamide protocol fared the best in terms of overall weight loss, while the lower-dose regimen was not much more effective than the placebo.\n\nAlthough nearly 55 percent of those on the higher-dose medication shed 5 percent or more of their pre-study weight, that figure was 34 percent among the lower-dose group and 31 percent among the non-medication participants.\n\nBut patients in both drug groups faced a higher risk for side effects, including diarrhea, headache, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, concentration and memory difficulties, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms.\n\nThe authors said such side effects were typically ""mild."" They concluded that the higher-dose zonisamide showed promise as a weight-loss aid, but advised clinicians to carefully weigh the pros and cons on a patient-by-patient basis.\n\n""There\'s no medicine that is a panacea for obesity,"" cautioned Gadde. ""The important thing to keep in mind is that although we diagnose obesity on the basis of a mathematical formula -- a BMI of 30 and up -- the basis for obesity may differ from one individual to another.""\n\nPsychological factors or lifestyle factors may play a role, he said. ""But for about a third [of patients], biological issues are at play, such as not easily experiencing satiety signals from the gut to the brain, which senses what your energy intake has been,"" he said. ""And for those people, medication can help.""\n\nLona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, agreed.\n\nCaution is vital when using any drug that has been approved for one condition for another, Sandon said.\n\n""But for many people, this kind of drug might absolutely be of great help, by doing something that helps the regulation of these appetite hormones and the regulatory pathway,"" she said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on obesity, visit the U.S. National Institutes of Health.']",Read past the headline and a fuller picture of the drug study emerges.,"This story could have been helped by more insightful independent perspective, but, overall, readers got a decent explanation of the study’s design, and on the small scale of the benefits, and on the possible side effects.

""We still need more research, but this new trial provides more evidence than we have ever had of cannabidiol\'s effectiveness as a medication for treatment-resistant epilepsy.""\n\nCannabidiol, or CBD, is a compound in the cannabis plant that does not contain psychoactive properties that induce a high. The study included a liquid pharmaceutical formulation of CBD, called Epidiolex, which is manufactured by GW Pharmaceuticals and has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. GW Pharmaceuticals funded the clinical trial.\n\nFor the study, 120 children and adolescents with Dravet Syndrome between the ages of 2 and 18 years were randomized across 23 sites in the United States and Europe to receive either CBD 20 mg/kg or placebo added to their existing treatment over a 14-week period. Seizure frequency was tracked for one month prior to the study for baseline readings, and during the course of the study.\n\nSpecifically, seizure frequency dropped in the CBD-treated group by 39 percent from a median of nearly 12 convulsive seizures per month before the study to about six; three patients\' seizures stopped entirely. In the placebo group, there was a 13 percent reduction in seizures from about 15 monthly seizures to fourteen. The difference in the degree of seizure reduction between the CBD group and the placebo group was both statistically significant and clinically consistent.\n\nSide effects – experienced by 93.4 percent of patients in the CBD group and 74.6 percent of those treated with placebo – were generally reported as mild or moderate in severity. The most common side effects in the CBD group were vomiting, fatigue and fever. Eight participants from the CBD group withdrew from the trial due to side effects compared to one participant in the placebo group.\n\nThe new study confirms results from a December 2015 open-label expanded access program led by Dr. Devinsky that reported reductions in seizure frequency. In that program, both the researchers and patient\'s families knew they were receiving CBD, which may have introduced a bias into the results. This new, randomized, controlled clinical study eliminated those concerns as participants and their physicians did not know if they were on CBD or placebo, say the study authors.\n\nFuture research will look at whether safety and tolerability might be improved and whether efficacy of CBD can be maintained at lower doses. Longer term studies of CBD for Dravet Syndrome as well as for other forms of treatment-resistant epilepsy are also underway.\n\nIn addition to Dr. Devinsky, the co-authors in this study were: J. Helen Cross, PhD, FRCPCH, Linda Laux, MD, Eric Marsh, MD, Ian Miller, MD, Rima Nabbout, MD, Ingrid E Scheffer, MD, PhD , Elizabeth Thiele, MD, and Stephen Wright, MD on behalf of The Cannabidiol in Dravet Syndrome Study Group. Judith Bluvstein, MD, and Daniel Friedman, MD, also served as co-authors at the NYU Langone site involved in the study.\n\nMedia contact:\n\nRyan Jaslow\n\nryan.jaslow@nyumc.org\n\n212-404-3511\n\nSOURCE NYU Langone Medical Center\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.med.nyu.edu\n\n']",The release provides a thorough description of benefits and side effects that were reported from the trial. It also includes cautions and nuance that are missing from many news releases.,"This release from the NYU Langone Medical Center describes a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial of children and adolescents with Dravet syndome, an extreme form of epilepsy, who often don’t respond to other drugs. The release provides a very good description of the benefits and the side effects that were reported from the trial. It adds cautions and nuance that are missing from many news releases.
But not included were the cost of the new drug (projected to be quite steep) and we think the release could have emphasized more that the children in the trial were already on seizure medications. When the cannabidiol (or a placebo) was added to the maintenance drug it alleviated seizures but also introduced a high degree of side effects.
A CNN story on the study, which we also reviewed, had many of the same strengths as the news release (overall depth and detail on benefits), but it similarly skipped cost information.

Slow, deep and consistent breathing has been shown to have benefits in treating conditions ranging from migraines and irritable bowel syndrome to anxiety disorders and pain.\n\n“If you train yourself to breathe a little bit slower it can have long-term health benefits,” said Murali Doraiswamy, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. Deep breathing activates a relaxation response, he said, “potentially decreasing inflammation, improving heart health, boosting your immune system and maybe even improving longevity,”\n\nTo help foster the habit of healthful breathing, a San Francisco technology startup recently launched a wearable device called Spire that tracks breathing patterns and tells users when they are too tense or anxious. “One of the goals of this work was, ‘How do you make it so simple to shift into calm or focus that people don’t have to stop what they’re doing?’” said Neema Moraveji, co-founder of Spire and director of the Calming Technology Lab at Stanford University.\n\nMany early buyers of the $150 Spire are office workers who spend a lot of time on computers. Research has found people working on computers often hold their breath, an action referred to as screen apnea, he said.\n\nBelisa Vranich, a New York City-based clinical psychologist, has been conducting breathing workshops around the country for just over a year. Among her biggest clients: corporate managers eager to learn how to better manage stress.\n\nDr. Vranich says she instructs clients to breathe with their abdomen. On the inhale, this encourages the diaphragm to flatten out and the ribs to flare out. Most of us by instinct breathe vertically, using our chest, shoulders and neck, she says.\n\nAbdominal, or diaphragmatic, breathing is often taught in yoga and meditation classes. Experts say air should be breathed in through the nose, and the exhale should be longer than the inhale. Dr. Vranich recommends trying to breathe this way all the time but other experts say it is enough to use the technique during stressful or tense times or when it is necessary to focus or concentrate.\n\nSlow breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, which runs from the stem of the brain to the abdomen. It is part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the body’s “rest and digest” activities. (By contrast, the sympathetic nervous system regulates many of our “fight or flight” responses.)\n\nThe vagus-nerve activity causes the heart rate to decrease as we exhale, said Richard Gevirtz, a psychology professor at Alliant International University in San Diego. Vagal activity can be activated when breathing at about five to seven breaths a minute, said Dr. Gevirtz, compared with average breathing rates of about 12 to 18 breaths a minute.\n\nThe vagus nerve’s response includes the release of different chemicals, including acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that acts as an anti-inflammatory and slows down digestion and the heart rate, said Stephen Silberstein, director of the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia who is working on an article on the vagus nerve and its functions.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhen medical conditions are severe, such as with epilepsy, medical devices are sometimes implanted to stimulate the vagus nerve. For most people, slow, steady breathing is a natural way to stimulate the nerve.\n\nCertain conditions, including asthma and panic disorders, have been shown to benefit from a different breathing technique—taking shallow breaths through the nose at a regular rhythmic speed of eight to 13 breaths a minute. For these patients, already anxious about their symptoms, deep breathing can cause them to take in too much air and hyperventilate.\n\nHeart-rate-variability biofeedback uses breathing to train people to increase the variation in their heart rate, or the interval between heartbeats. The technique has been shown to have benefits for conditions including anxiety disorders and asthma. Biofeedback also makes breathing more efficient, said Paul Lehrer, a clinical psychologist at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, part of Rutgers University in New Jersey. On average most people reach this balance when breathing 11 seconds per breath.\n\nSpire, the device that tracks individual breathing patterns, is a pedometer-like device that can be clipped onto pants or a bra strap and can sense breathing patterns without touching the skin. A sensor detects subtle torso expansions and contractions, said Stanford’s Dr. Moraveji. The device identifies people’s baseline breathing patterns and can tell users when they are tense or may need to take a deep breath. It includes an app that guides people in breathing exercises as short as 30 seconds.\n\nDr. Moraveji’s research includes a 2011 Stanford study of 13 students that found subjects on average took 16.7 breaths a minute when they were doing normal computer work compared with 9.3 breaths a minute when they were relaxed, he said. The study was published in the proceedings of the annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology.\n\nA follow-up study involving 14 subjects found that giving feedback of breathing patterns on a computer screen allowed the subjects to control their breathing without decreasing their performance on an analytical task, Dr. Moraveji said. “We proved that because the breath is so easily controllable, you don’t have to interrupt your task in order to regulate your nervous system,” he said. The study was presented at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in 2012.\n\nDr. Vranich, the breathing coach, believes teaching people to unlearn dysfunctional breathing habits requires practice and exercises. Her group classes cost $150 for a three-hour workshop and private classes range from $350 to $450.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, she held a private session in her Manhattan studio with Joe March, a 40-year-old New York City firefighter who said he wanted to improve his lung capacity and condition for Brazilian jujitsu, a form of martial arts he practices.\n\nDr. Vranich positions many of her clients upside down, to better exercise the diaphragm muscles. She assisted Mr. March into a shoulder stand against a wall as she monitored his breathing. “Inhale, relax, and see if you can expand right by your diaphragm,” she said. “Exhale, squeeze your ribs at the same time.”\n\nEarl Winthrop, a 60-year-old partner of a Boston wealth-management firm, is another of Dr. Vranich’s clients. “When I was working on the computer, I wasn’t breathing properly,” said Mr. Winthrop, who now does tailored breathing exercises and short bouts of meditative breathing. “I’m much more aware now. I feel more focused. I can calm myself down,” he said.']","This story labels common breathing habits with terms like “screen apnea” and “dysfunctional breathing.” Noting a lack of evidence to justify such language, our reviewers flagged the story for disease-mongering.","Better breathing for better health is the simple premise of this story. Too simple. Despite quoting multiple sources, the story is a one-sided list of health claims that are not supported by consistent evidence. We applaud the price tags for devices and classes included in the story. And while the number of sources would normally win praise, the story should have included comments from researchers who are critical of the poor quality and inconsistent results of studies in this area.
Even a glance at the comments left by readers online demonstrates some of the skepticism we wish this story had brought to bear. An amusing example: “Rather than shelling out $150 for the opportunity to wear a Spire device on your belt–(or bra as the website suggests!)–take a deep breath, relax, and put your credit card away.  –There…don’t you feel better already?!”

Also, scar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult or dangerous.\n\nDr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries were a factor in his interest in developing the new device.\n\n“You are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective,” he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Since the cardiologist began work on the project about a decade ago, the defibrillator he helped design has gone through several iterations.\n\nThe device will not be suitable for a significant number of heart patients, particularly those who require units that also include a pacemaker, which regulates a heart that is beating too fast or too slowly.\n\nBut Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. These are largely patients at risk, because of genetic factors or certain types of heart diseases, for a type of erratic cardiac rhythm that can cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator. However, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler.\n\nBefore the device can be sold here, Cameron Health will have to submit more extensive human trial data to the F.D.A..

Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nThe study - the first trial to publish five-year results from SBRT treatment for prostate cancer - found a 98.6 percent cure rate with SBRT, a noninvasive form of radiation treatment that involves high-dose radiation beams entering the body through various angles and intersecting at the desired target. It is a state-of-the-art technology that allows for a concentrated dose to reach the tumor while limiting the radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n""The high cure rate is striking when compared to the reported five-year cure rates from other approaches like surgery or conventional radiation, which range between 80 to 90 percent, while the side effects of this treatment are comparable to other types of treatment,"" said Dr. Raquibul Hannan, Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology and lead author for the study. ""What we now have is a more potent and effective form of completely noninvasive treatment for prostate cancer, conveniently completed in five treatments.""\n\nConventional treatment options for early stage prostate cancer include:\n\nProstatectomy, the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which can be done with minimally invasive techniques and robotic assistance;\n\nBrachytherapy, in which doctors implant numerous small radioactive seeds about the size of a grain of rice into the prostate gland using multiple large needles inserted through the skin in the operating room. Once implanted, the seeds release their radioactivity directly into the prostate gland; and\n\nExternal beam radiation, which involves 42 to 45 treatments administered over two or more months, five days a week.\n\n""The current form of radiation is 44 treatments given over nine weeks. In contrast, the SBRT therapy we used allows the delivery of highly focused radiation in only five treatments, allowing patients to return to their normal lives more quickly,"" said senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman, Director of the Annette Simmons Stereotactic Treatment Center at UT Southwestern, and Professor and Vice Chairman of the Department of Radiation Oncology. ""SBRT is both more convenient and has increased potency.""\n\nUT Southwestern served as the lead site for the multi-institutional clinical trial, which involved first-time prostate cancer patients diagnosed with stage I or stage II (low and intermediate risk) prostate cancer. A total of 91 patients were treated prospectively and followed for five years, with only one patient experiencing a recurrence of his cancer. The findings are published in the European Journal of Cancer.\n\nTerry Martin of McKinney, Texas, - about an hour outside Dallas - said the fewer number of treatments was a compelling advantage when he was evaluating treatment options.\n\n""I live 45 minutes away from UT Southwestern. The difference between being treated five times versus 44 times is enormous,"" said Mr. Martin, a retired airline pilot. ""I felt that I was back to normal just 10 days after finishing treatment.""\n\nIn addition to shorter treatment times, researchers found that side effects were not necessarily different compared to other forms of prostate cancer treatment. In the short term, the side effects of SBRT can include urinary issues (urgency, frequency and burning) and rectal irritation, which are often temporary and reverse within four weeks of treatment. Researchers found a small risk of longer-term urinary and rectal complications, which is also comparable to conventional treatments. Decrease in erectile function was seen in 25 percent of patients, fewer than with conventional radiation or surgery, said Dr. Hannan.\n\nTo reduce the side effects associated with SBRT, current clinical trials at UTSW are using a unique and biodegradable rectal spacer gel to protect the rectum. UTSW is currently the only accredited site in Texas at which this spacer gel can be used.\n\nOther clinical trials at the UTSW Department of Radiation Oncology are seeking to expand the application of SBRT to high-risk (Stage III) prostate cancer patients. ""Our hope is that the high potency of this form of treatment will significantly improve treatment of these patients,"" says Dr. Hannan, the principal investigator of the high-risk prostate SBRT trial.\n\nUT Southwestern has been a leader in pioneering use of SBRT. Dr. Timmerman, Director of Image-Guided Stereotactic Radiation Therapy, Medical Director of Radiation Oncology, and holder of the Effie Marie Cain Distinguished Chair in Cancer Therapy Research, has served as the lead investigator in several national trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT to treat other types of cancer, including cancer in the lung, liver, and spine. A range of clinical trials of SBRT therapy are under way at Simmons Cancer Center, including new investigations evaluating use of SBRT for cancers in the breast and larynx.\n\nSince 2009, UT Southwestern has trained more than 300 physicians and peers interested in implementing SBRT in their clinical practice. Simmons Cancer Center\'s arsenal of stereotactic radiotherapy technology includes the cutting-edge Gamma Knife, CyberKnife, Agility, Vero SBRT and TrueBeam technologies.\n\n###\n\nThe SBRT study for prostate cancer was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense. Additional UTSW researchers involved in the study include Dr. Yair Lotan, Professor of Urology and holder of the Helen J. and Robert S. Strauss Professorship in Urology, and Dr. Xian-Jin Xie, Professor of Clinical Science.\n\nThe Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center is the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in North Texas and one of just 45 NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the nation. The Simmons Cancer Center includes 13 major cancer care programs with a focus on treating the whole patient with innovative treatments, while fostering groundbreaking basic research that has the potential to improve patient care and prevention of cancer worldwide. In addition, the Center\'s education and training programs support and develop the next generation of cancer researchers and clinicians.\n\nThe Simmons Cancer Center is among only 30 U.S. cancer research centers and the only cancer center in North Texas to be named a National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site, a prestigious designation by the NCI, designed to bolster clinical cancer research for adults and to provide patients access to cancer research trials sponsored by the NCI, where promising new drugs often are tested. About UT Southwestern Medical Center\n\nUT Southwestern, one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation, integrates pioneering biomedical research with exceptional clinical care and education. The institution\'s faculty has included six who have been awarded Nobel Prizes since 1985. The faculty of almost 2,800 is responsible for groundbreaking medical advances and is committed to translating science-driven research quickly to new clinical treatments. UT Southwestern physicians provide medical care in about 80 specialties to more than 92,000 hospitalized patients and oversee approximately 2.2 million outpatient visits a year.\n\nThis news release is available on our home page at http://www. utsouthwestern. edu/ home/ news/ index. html']",The findings from a small safety trial were re-interpreted to suggest a high “cure” rate using an alternative form of radiation for prostate cancer.,"This news release draws from a Phasel/ll safety study of 91 patients who were given a concentrated form of higher-dose radiation known as stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, instead of typical radiation therapy for early-stage prostate cancer. The study was designed to test the toxicity of increasing levels of radiation, not to assess the survival rate.  While the five-year study showed benefits, the release failed to provide the numbers and details that we believe would help readers understand the risks vs. benefits. The “cure” rate referred just to men who had no evidence of rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) — and the study acknowledges that most men were not actually followed for 5 years so a “cure rate” was statistically estimated. However, over a third of the men had low-risk cancer where the 5-year cancer-specific survival is estimated to be 100 percent. It’s not certain that these men actually required treatment.

Older women, on the other hand, may take too much, putting themselves at risk for kidney stones . And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote.\n\nAs for vitamin D, some prominent doctors have said that most people need supplements or they will be at increased risk for a wide variety of illnesses, including heart disease, cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd these days more and more people know their vitamin D levels because they are being tested for it as part of routine physical exams.\n\n“The number of vitamin D tests has exploded,” said Dennis Black, a reviewer of the report who is a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco .\n\nAt the same time, vitamin D sales have soared, growing faster than those of any supplement, according to The Nutrition Business Journal. Sales rose 82 percent from 2008 to 2009, reaching $430 million. “Everyone was hoping vitamin D would be kind of a panacea,” Dr. Black said. The report, he added, might quell the craze.\n\n“I think this will have an impact on a lot of primary care providers,” he said.\n\nThe 14-member expert committee was convened by the Institute of Medicine, an independent nonprofit scientific body, at the request of the United States and Canadian governments. It was asked to examine the available data — nearly 1,000 publications — to determine how much vitamin D and calcium people were getting, how much was needed for optimal health and how much was too much.\n\nThe two nutrients work together for bone health.\n\nBone health, though, is only one of the benefits that have been attributed to vitamin D, and there is not enough good evidence to support most other claims, the committee said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome labs have started reporting levels of less than 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood as a deficiency. With that as a standard, 80 percent of the population would be deemed deficient of vitamin D, Dr. Rosen said. Most people need to take supplements to reach levels above 30 nanograms per milliliter, he added.\n\nBut, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range.\n\nVitamin D is being added to more and more foods, said Paul R. Thomas of the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. Not only is it in orange juice and milk, but more is being added to breakfast cereals, and it now can be found in very high doses in supplement pills. Most vitamin D pills, he said, used to contain no more than 1,000 international units of it. Now it is easy to find pills, even in places like Wal-Mart , with 5,000 international units. The committee, though, said people need only 600 international units a day.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo assess the amounts of vitamin D and calcium people are getting, the panel looked at national data on diets. Most people, they concluded, get enough calcium from the foods they eat, about 1,000 milligrams a day for most adults (1,200 for women ages 51 to 70).\n\nVitamin D is more complicated, the group said. In general, most people are not getting enough vitamin D from their diets, but they have enough of the vitamin in their blood, probably because they are also making it naturally after being out in the sun and storing it in their bodies.\n\nThe American Society for Bone and Mineral Research and other groups applauded the report. It is “a very balanced set of recommendations,” said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist and the society’s president.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said there was no convincing evidence that people were being harmed by taking supplements, and he said higher levels of vitamin D, in particular, could be beneficial.\n\nSuch claims “are not supported by the available evidence,” the committee wrote. They were based on studies that observed populations and concluded that people with lower levels of the vitamin had more of various diseases. Such studies have been misleading and most scientists agree that they cannot determine cause and effect.\n\nIt is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say. First there were two studies, which turned out to be incorrect, that said people needed 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood, the upper end of what the committee says is a normal range. They were followed by articles and claims and books saying much higher levels — 40 to 50 nanograms or even higher — were needed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter reviewing the data, the committee concluded that the evidence for the benefits of high levels of vitamin D was “inconsistent and/or conflicting and did not demonstrate causality.”\n\nEvidence also suggests that high levels of vitamin D can increase the risks for fractures and the overall death rate and can raise the risk for other diseases. While those studies are not conclusive, any risk looms large when there is no demonstrable benefit. Those hints of risk are “challenging the concept that ‘more is better,’ ” the committee wrote.\n\nThat is what surprised Dr. Black. “We thought that probably higher is better,” he said.\n\nHe has changed his mind, and expects others will too: “I think this report will make people more cautious.”""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story wasn’t afraid to pass judgment on lesser quality evidence. It confidently explained why an expert Institute of Medicine panel didn’t buy into the idea, promoted shamelessly over the past few years in various media as well as in the scientific literature, that everyone needs to be getting more vitamin D and calcium.</span>","In one particularly effective passage, the story quoted a representative of a supplement industry group who disagreed with the report, saying that higher levels of vitamin D could be beneficial. But it then segued immediately into an explanation of why claims from supplementation advocates “are not supported by the available evidence.” The key problem, as the story points out, is that these claims are based almost exclusively on observational studies that can’t prove cause and effect and are often skewed by factors the researchers haven’t accounted for. Proponents of supplementation also have tended to downplay the possibility that higher doses of vitamin D and calcium might cause harm–a stance which the story notes may not be justified. We applaud this story’s effort to show readers where the weight of the evidence lies on this issue.

Many report having poor control of their symptoms. Fortunately, new research shows there is a simple antidote: 30 minutes of exercise a day, year-round.\n\nIn a study recently published in BMJ Open Respiratory Research, experts from Concordia University, the Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal and several other institutions* analyzed the exercise habits of 643 participants who had been diagnosed with asthma.\n\nResults were overwhelmingly clear: those who engaged in optimal levels of physical activity on a regular basis were nearly two-and-a-half times more likely to have good control of their symptoms, compared with those who did no exercise.\n\nThe workout doesn\'t have to be strenuous. ""We\'re not talking about running marathons here,"" says Simon Bacon, the study\'s lead author and a professor in the Department of Exercise Science at Concordia. ""Just 30 minutes a day of walking, riding a bike, doing yoga -- anything active, really -- can result in significant reduction of asthma symptoms.""\n\nTraditionally, people with the condition have been discouraged from exercising because of a belief that it triggers shortness of breath and attacks. Bacon explains that simple precautionary measures can be taken to avoid the discomforts that can be caused by physical activity.\n\n""The issue of exercise-induced bronchospasm is real -- but if you use your releaver medication, blue puffer, before you exercise, and then take the time to cool down afterwards, you should be okay,"" he says. ""Even if you have asthma, there\'s no good reason not to get out there and exercise.""\n\nThat\'s a message Bacon hopes resonates. Within his sample group of 643 individuals, a whopping 245 reported doing no physical activity. Only 100 said they engaged in the optimal 30 minutes a day.\n\n""Those numbers reflect the population in general,"" says Bacon, who is also director of the Centre de réadaptation Jean-Jacques-Gauthier at Hopital du Sacré-Coeur. Forty per cent of people don\'t exercise at all, he says.\n\n""We need to keep in mind that doing something is better than nothing, and doing more is better than less. Even the smallest amount of activity is beneficial.""\n\nIt\'s something to keep in mind during winter months, when fitness levels tend to drop along with the temperature, and cold air provides another trigger for asthma symptoms.\n\n""Our study shows that those who were able to engage in physical activity on a regular basis year-round benefit most,"" says Bacon. If necessary, he suggests finding an indoor place to move, whether it\'s the gym, a staircase or a shopping mall.\n\n""It\'s all about being creative and finding environments where the cold doesn\'t become an issue.""\n\nCould a prescription for exercise be the result of this study Bacon is hopeful. ""It would be great to see physicians recommending physical activity to patients with asthma, alongside traditional pharmacological treatments,"" he says.\n\nPartners in research: Funding support for this study was provided by grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Michel Auger Foundation of Hopital du Sacre-Coeur de Montreal.\n\n###\n\n*Institutions involved are: Hôpital du Sacré-C\x9cur de Montréal, Concordia University, Université de Montreal, Université de Quebec en Outaouais, Université de Montpellier, and Université de Quebec à Montreal.\n\nRelated links:\n\nCited study: http://bmjopenrespres. bmj. com/ content/ 2/ 1/ e000083. abstract\n\nDepartment of Exercise Science https:/ / www. concordia. ca/ artsci/ exercise-science. html\n\nSimon Bacon https:/ / www. concordia. ca/ artsci/ exercise-science/ faculty. htmlfpid= simon-bacon\n\nHopital du Sacré-C\x9cur Montréal http://www. hscm. ca/\n\nMedia contact:']","We found a lot of room for improvement in this university news release, starting with a headline that overstates the evidence.","The news release from Concordia University in French-speaking Montreal highlights a new study published in BMJ Open Respiratory Research, which explored the correlation between regular exercise and patients’ control of asthma symptoms. The release makes good use of direct quotes from the study’s lead author, who brings color into the piece. On the other hand, it lacks a thorough discussion of the study’s important limitations and inappropriately suggests that exercise is responsible for the benefits seen in those who exercise more — e.g. the headline “Regular exercise relieves asthma symptoms.” That’s a conclusion that simply can’t be drawn based on this observational study, which showed a correlation only and cannot demonstrate cause and effect.

They speculate that good nutrition may promote brain growth and cognitive development.\n\n""We have found some evidence to suggest that a diet associated with increasing consumption of foods that are high in fat, sugar and processed foods in early childhood is associated with small reductions in IQ in later childhood,"" said lead researcher Kate Northstone, a research fellow in the department of social medicine at the University of Bristol.\n\nA more health-conscious diet was associated with small increases in IQ, she said.\n\nChildren should be encouraged to eat healthy foods from an early age, she said. ""We know this is important for physical growth and development, but it may also be important for mental ability,"" she added.\n\nFor the study, published online Feb. 7 in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, Northstone\'s team collected data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children on 3,966 children born in 1991 and 1992.\n\nThe children\'s parents had answered questions about their kids\' diets at age 3, 4, 7 and 8.5 years. The children\'s IQs were measured using the standard Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children when they were 8.5 years old.\n\nThe researchers identified three basic diets: ""processed,"" crammed with fats, sugar and convenience foods; a ""traditional"" diet high in meats and vegetables; and a ""health conscious"" diet with lots of fruit, vegetables, salads, fish, rice and pasta.\n\nChildren who ate a diet high in processed foods at age 3 had a lower IQ at 8.5 years than kids with a healthy diet. For every one point increase in processed foods consumption, they lost 1.67 points in IQ. Conversely, every one point increase in healthy eating translated into a 1.2 point increase in IQ, the researchers found.\n\nThe key seemed to be the diet at age 3, since diet at 4 and 7 seemed to have no effect on IQ, the research team noted. However, to truly understand the effect of diet on children\'s intelligence, further studies are needed, they said.\n\nCommenting on the study, Samantha Heller, a dietitian, nutritionist and exercise physiologist in Fairfield, Conn., said that ""most of us do not realize that the foods we eat have direct consequences on brain growth, function and performance.""\n\nWhen a child\'s diet consists primarily of high-calorie foods that are low in the nutrients they need (such as healthy fats, vitamins and minerals), their brains don\'t get the compounds necessary to develop and function properly, Heller said. ""This can have a series of deleterious effects, including decreased cognitive ability, poor behavior and social skills,"" she said.\n\n""Fast and junk food seem like an easy and affordable option for busy parents, but defaulting to high-fat, high-sugar, high-calorie foods is putting their children\'s health and future at risk,"" Heller said.\n\nCooking easy, healthy meals for the family will give ""children\'s brains a boost in essential nutrients needed for healthy development and improved cognitive skills,"" she added.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on healthful eating for kids, visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Starting with a fear-mongering headline, this story didn’t frame the study results with the caution befitting an observational study. </span>","The story used language which suggests that the diet was responsible for the differences in IQ observed by the researchers — something this study wasn’t designed to prove. And it doesn’t explain, in terms of actual food, how much worse (or better) a diet had to be to be linked to cognitive deficits (or improvements). It didn’t compare the effects of diet with other factors — such as talking to and interacting with children — that have been linked to better cognitive development in other studies.

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\n\nThe study shows the benefits of genetic tests that give women with a family history of cancer the chance to take steps to increase their chances of survival, they said.\n\n“This is the first study to prove women survive longer with these preventive surgeries and shows the importance of genetic testing when there is a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer,” Dr. Virginia Kaklamani of Northwestern University in Chicago wrote in a commentary about the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nWomen with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have a 56 to 84 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetimes.\n\nThose with the BRCA1 mutation also have a 36 to 63 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer and those with the BRCA2 mutation have a 10 to 27 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer.\n\nBecause of this, many women make the difficult choice to have their breasts or ovaries and fallopian tubes surgically removed to reduce their risk.\n\nDr. Susan M. Domchek of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and colleagues studied the effectiveness of these procedures in 2,482 women with BRCA mutations, including 247 women who had risk-reducing surgery to remove their breasts and 993 who had risk-reducing surgery to remove their ovaries.\n\nNo woman who had a mastectomy developed breast cancer during the three years of follow-up testing.\n\nSeven percent of women who decided against a mastectomy were diagnosed with breast cancer in the same period.\n\n“Our results confirm that risk-reducing mastectomy is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer risk,” Domchek and colleagues wrote.\n\nWomen with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations who had their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed had similar results.\n\nAbout 10 to 20 percent of breast and ovarian cancers are due to BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. “Most of these women will die of ovarian cancer, so you can save 20 percent of them with the prophylactic surgery,” Kaklamani said.\n\n“And you can save the majority of women who would have died of their breast cancer,” she added.\n\nShe said primary care physicians, gynecologists and women “need to be more aware that these tests exist.”\n\nDr. Sandhya Pruthi, a breast cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who counsels women with BRCA mutations, said the study adds more evidence that the surgery can help save lives, but the choice is never easy.\n\n“It’s not cookie-cutter medicine,” Pruthi, who was not involved in the study, said in a telephone interview.\n\nShe said women need to come to terms with the psychological issues involved in having their breasts removed, and younger women who have their ovaries removed must contend with early menopause symptoms.\n\n“It’s not a decision made on a single visit,” she said.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, 1.3 million new breast cancer cases are diagnosed around the world every year and it kills 465,000 women annually, making it the leading global cancer killer of women.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">There were huge gaps in this story – the weakest of four we reviewed on this same study. </span>","1clip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/>

The greatest hope for a so-called ""female Viagra"" was a drug called flibanserin, but it was nixed by a panel of Food and Drug Administration experts on Friday, who said the drug didn\'t seem to really help women with sexual dysfunction.\n\nThis was the second time a so-called ""female Viagra"" failed to make it on the market; in 2004, an FDA panel said no to Intrinsa, a testosterone patch meant to hormonally help women with a lack of desire for sex.\n\nGiven these two rejections, it could be a while before another pharmaceutical company decides to sink money into developing a new drug for women with sexual problems. One company, BioSante Pharmaceuticals, hopes to bring a testosterone gel to the market in 2012, but there aren\'t many other products on the horizon.\n\n""There hasn\'t been much action in this area, and that certainly has to come up when a company is thinking about dumping money into researching a drug for female sexual dysfunction,"" says Phyllis Greenberger, president of the Society for Women\'s Health Research, which received money from Boehringer Ingelheim, the company that makes flibanserin.\n\nThat\'s despite a seeming need for such medication. In 2008, a survey of more than 30,000 U.S. women in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology found that nearly 40 percent reported that they\'d had a sexual problem at some point in their lives, most often a lack of desire.\n\nAfter seeing medical doctors but getting few results, Poelzl decided to take another route. She visited alternative practitioners and began experimenting with Taoist exercises used in Chinese medicine. She practiced six minutes of exercises every morning, such as sitting quietly in a chair massaging her lower abdomen.\n\nWhile there\'s no hard science that shows that Taoist practices will improve a woman\'s sex life, Poelzl says it worked for her.\n\n""I noticed I started feeling more energy in my body, and more libido,"" she says. ""But it took at least six weeks of almost daily practice. You have to be committed.""\n\nIn fact, for nearly all alternative practices there are no large-scale studies saying if they work or not. But in the absence of a drug to help women with sexual problems, here\'s what\'s recommended by some practitioners.\n\n1. Acupuncture\n\nJill Blakeway, a licensed acupuncturist who practices in New York City, started out doing acupuncture to help women get pregnant. But then a few years later she started noticing something interesting.\n\n""After having a couple of kids, patients were coming back to me and saying, \'I just never feel like it anymore,\'"" Blakeway says.\n\nShe then developed a specialty in acupuncture to help women lift their flagging libidos. She says acupuncture, like Viagra, increases blood flow to the genitals, but unlike Viagra, it usually takes four to six weeks to see results.\n\n""If your sexuality has been lying dormant for a while, then it\'s going to take a while to wake it up,"" Blakeway says. ""And when it does wake up, I tell women not to see this as goal-oriented orgasmic sex, but rather as a way of connecting to their partner.""\n\nOne of Blakeway\'s patients wrote an article for the magazine, Cookie, about her experience with acupuncture for her flagging sex life.\n\nTo find an acupuncturist near you, go to the website of the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine and check off ""Chinese Herbology Certification.""\n\n2. Chinese medicine\n\nBlakeway says she often has success combining acupuncture with Chinese medicine. To find a practitioner familiar with Chinese medicine, go to the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine\n\nBlakeway says between acupuncture and Chinese medicine, she\'s able to help about 65 percent of the women who come to her with sexual problems.\n\n3. Maca\n\nA root vegetable grown in high elevations in the mountains of Peru, animal studies have shown that maca increases sex drive. It\'s widely marketed in Peru as an aphrodisiac, where it\'s sold in several forms, including capsules and powdered form.\n\nResearchers at Massachusetts General Hospital are studying maca in women with sexual dysfunction.\n\nHere\'s more information on the sexual effects of maca from New York University Langone Medical Center.\n\n4. Ginkgo biloba\n\nResearchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that the herb ginkgo biloba was useful in helping women who had sexual dysfunction brought on by antidepressants.\n\nHere\'s more information on ginkgo, including its sexual effects, from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n5. Herbal combinations\n\nDr. Craig Koniver, a Charleston, South Carolina, family physician who specializes in alternative medicine, says he has success treating women with sexual dysfunction with herbal combinations. Several companies, including one owned by Koniver, make herbal combinations.\n\nYou can also visit a practitioner familiar with herbs to make a combination for you. You can find a practitioner through the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, or if you prefer a medical doctor, visit the website of the American College for Advancement in Medicine, where you can put in your ZIP code and find a doctor who specializes in integrative medicine.\n\nWhatever you try to get your libido back, remember that your first attempt might not work.\n\n""Different things for different women,"" Blakeley says. ""It\'s not a one-size-fits-all situation.""\n\nCNN Intern Carrie Gann contributed to this report.']","In the wake of an FDA panel’s nearly unanimous vote not to approve flibanserin, a drug to treat low libido in women, CNN posts a remarkably shallow piece on 5 alternative therapies for this condition that have even less evidence to support their use.","Along the way the story engages in some pretty egregious disease-mongering, relies almost exclusively on positive anecdotes instead of data, and manages to avoid quoting anyone with a remotely skeptical view of these therapies.   This story is a good example of the problem of reporting on complementary and alternative therapies.  Because the evidence base is thin, anecdotes are often relied upon, to the detriment of any helpful information for patients.

The 24-year-old from Dublin, Ohio, was in an accident six years ago that left his arms and legs paralysed. But now, thanks to computer software that decodes his thoughts and sends the signal to his hands, he\'s been able to pick up small objects, swipe a credit card, and even play Guitar Hero – albeit in a science lab. This is the first time a person with paralysis has regained movement in their hands and individual fingers using signals from their brain. Details of the system that allows him to do this, developed by scientists at Ohio State University and Battelle Memorial Institute, are published in the journal Nature today. The study builds on previous work in which humans have been able to move computer cursors and robotic arms using their own brain signals, and a study in which monkeys with paralysed arms were able to move them again thanks to a similar intervention.\n\nNature Video / youtube.com Burkhart before his accident.\n\nIt was the summer after his freshman year of college when Burkhart lost the ability to move his arms and legs. ""I was 19 years old, really independent, and I didn\'t think anything like this would happen in my life that would slow me down and set me back this much,"" Burkhart said during a press briefing. ""I dove into a wave that then pushed me down into a sandbar – the water wasn\'t as deep as I thought. I was lucky to have friends with me who were able to pull me out of the water and get medical attention."" The injury in his spinal cord means he doesn\'t have any movement below his elbow, so he is missing the fine motor movement in his hands that would allow him to grasp or pick up objects. Burkhart\'s thoughts and brain signals work in the same way as they did before the accident, but his spinal cord injury means they never reach his hand, leaving him unable to move it. He has some residual movement in his shoulders, and can use those working shoulder muscles to move his arms about. ""That\'s how I do pretty much everything in my daily life when I\'m not hooked up to the system,"" he says.\n\nThe system works by bypassing Burkhart\'s spinal cord injury. A device implanted in his brain records signals from neurons that fire when he thinks about a movement – picking up a cup, for example. This signal is passed to a computer that decodes it, and the resulting instruction is then sent to a sleeve he wears on his forearm that stimulates the muscles that move his wrist and fingers. In June 2014, in the early stages of the trial, Burkhart moved his hand again for the first time after his accident. ""It was a flicker of hope, knowing that this was something that was working, knowing I will be able to use my hand again,"" he said. After three sessions a week for over a year, he is able to use the system to do things he couldn\'t do on his own, like pick up a mug and pour its contents into another container, swipe a credit card, and play Guitar Hero.\n\nSo far he\'s been able to make isolated finger movements and six different hand and wrist movements. To test how useful this would be in a normal situation, the scientists had Burkhart pick up a container, empty its contents into a jar, then pick up a stick and stir the contents of the jar. It was a struggle at first, but by the end of the trial he was able to complete the action three out of five times in a 10-minute period.\n\nThe setup currently requires a 10–15-minute training period at the beginning of every session. Burkhart watches videos of different hand movements he\'s going to perform that day and thinks about the movements, so the computer learns what the brain signals for each movement looks like. ""The machine is actually learning, and Ian is learning how to refine his thought patterns,"" Chad Bouton, lead author on the paper, said in a press briefing. ""So the machine and the person are learning together, and after that 10–15-minute period there\'s a dramatic improvement, it\'s been really amazing to watch."" ""Initially, we\'d do a short session and I\'d feel completely mentally fatigued and exhausted,"" said Burkhart. ""But just like anything, with more and more practice it\'s become easier.""\n\n""This technology is possible because there\'s about 50 years of basic neuroscience that has been looking at how signals in the brain encode information about movement,"" Dr Andrew Jackson, a neuroscientist at Newcastle University who was not involved with the work, told BuzzFeed News. ""What we\'re seeing now is all of that basic research which was driven by purely scientific questions coming to fruition in terms of enabling new treatments, but there\'s still a lot we need to learn."" There are still many challenges to be overcome to bring this work out of the lab and into the lives of the millions of people who are paralysed. ""We have to be realistic about this, there\'s still quite a long way towards turning this into something that would be feasible for widespread use in large numbers of people,"" Jackson said. For starters, the device that records the brain signals will need to be much smaller so it\'s fully implanted under the paralysed person\'s skin. ""One of the directions the field is moving towards,"" Jackson said, ""is to develop implanted devices that can be positioned under the skin and communicate wirelessly or route signals to the muscles completely under the skin.""\n\nOhio State University Wexner Medical Center/ Batelle Burkhart swipes a credit card during the study.\n\nOur understanding of how brain signals change will also be crucial to making this technology usable on a large scale. ""The recordings we get from these electrodes in the brain can be quite unstable from day to day,"" Jackson said. That\'s why the device requires training every time Burkhart uses it. ""What we\'d really like is a system that\'s plug and play and will work daily without needing to be recalibrated."" That could come from better electrode designs or looking for different signals that are more stable. Dr Jonas Zimmerman, a neuroscientist at Brown University in the US, who was also not involved with the study, echoed Jackson\'s point. ""Brain signals change from day to day (even hour to hour), the signals may be different depending on context (am I trying to lift a full or an empty glass, do I watch someone draw or do I want to draw myself), and brain signals change while we learn a new task,"" he told BuzzFeed news. ""We need to understand a lot more about the brain before we will make really meaningful improvements in this direction. ""It will be years until a paralyzed patient will be able to control neural prostheses independently from caregivers, but there is nothing that should make this improvement impossible.""']","By saving important details for the end, and skipping over some facts entirely, this story may leave readers with an unrealistic impression of what this new technology does.","This is a story about a case study involving one man with a specific type of partial paralysis, who regained some motion via an experimental device implanted in his brain and connected to a device worn on his arm.
The case study is undoubtedly newsworthy, but BuzzFeed’s coverage was unbalanced. It starts off with a “be amazed” tone, skipping over important nuances about the technology and the man’s limited skills. For example, the headline blares that a mind-reading computer allows the man to play “Guitar Hero.” Only much later in the story do we get important details and caveats, ending on a “be disappointed” tone.
As well, the story should have told readers that the lead researchers have an interest in patents associated with the hardware and software they are developing.

He was a highly regarded, successful innovator, so he thought it would be easy to find a company.\n\n“I started looking for companies to help me, but it was a complete failure,” he said. “All the companies in the United States and Europe and Japan, they have experts, and the experts are surgeons and they said it is absolutely not possible. We would kill the patients on the table.”\n\nHe joined forces with a former Johnson & Johnson executive, Stanton Rowe, who began making the rounds of venture capitalists. But, Mr. Rowe said, their response was always the same: “ ‘We will look into it.’ And who do they call? The surgeons. They told them all the reasons why it won’t work.”\n\nDr. Cohn, the Harvard heart surgeon, said he and his colleagues had good reasons to look askance. They thought it was strange that the old valve would just remain in the heart. They wondered why the new one would not fly off into the rush of blood being pumped into the aorta — after all, it was not being sewn in. And pushing a valve into an atherosclerotic artery? Pieces of plaque could break off and cause blood clots and strokes. Finally, he added, it would take patients away from surgeons.\n\n“We were skeptical,” he said.\n\nTwo and a half years later, after Dr. Cribier had practiced inserting valves in sheep, a 57-year-old man arrived at his hospital needing an aortic valve, on the brink of death, with almost no heartbeat. He had so many medical problems — severe coronary artery disease, chronic pancreatitis — that surgery was not an option. Then again, no human had ever had a valve put in without surgery.\n\n“I had to ask the patient his wish,” Dr. Cribier said. “His response was, ‘Please, please do it.’ ”\n\n“It was the most stressful day for me,” he said. Sheep, he explained, do not develop aortic stenosis, and their anatomy is very different. “We were not sure we could translate it into man,” he said.']","This story documents the labored development of catheter-based aortic stenosis treatment, but seems to harbor few if any doubts about the future success of this approach.","Henry Kissinger’s experience is one of several positive anecdotes presented in the story.

While the FDA has approved four medications for weight loss in the past 2 1/2 years, the Maestro system is the first weight loss device to be approved since 2007.\n\nUsing electrical leads implanted just above the stomach and a regulator carried under the skin near the ribcage, the device suppresses signals carried by the vagus nerve.\n\nThe device adopts a variant of a “neuromodulation” technique long used in the treatment of epilepsy: by applying intermittent bursts of electrical current to the vagus nerve, it disrupts the signals that prompt the stomach to relax, expand and prepare for an influx of food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We think it will be a very important tool in the toolbag of surgeons and physicians treating obesity and its co-morbidities,” said Gregory S. Lea, senior vice president and chief financial officer of EnteroMedics. “When patients leave the diet, counseling and drug world and have nothing more, they turn to surgical procedures, and only 1% to 2% of patients who might be eligible for bariatric surgery are getting it.”\n\nThe FDA approved the use of the device in adult patients with a body mass index, or BMI, between 35 and 45, who have at least one other obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes.\n\nDelivered by the Maestro device, vagal blocking therapy, or VBLOC, offers obese patients a weight loss therapy that does not permanently alter the digestive system in the way that gastric bypass surgery does, and which may be less expensive, said Lea. He added it poses no risk of the “malabsorption” problems that often come with such surgery.\n\nIn a 12-month clinical trial considered by the FDA, 38.3% of subjects who received the active Maestro device lost at least a quarter of their excess weight, and 52.5% of subjects lost at least 20% of their excess weight. On average, weight loss in those subjects with an active device was about 8.5% greater than that seen in subjects who received a Maestro electrical pulse generator that was not activated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe human body’s longest cranial nerve, the vagus--or “wandering""--nerve stretches from the lower abdomen up to the brain stem, passing through the heart, esophagus and lungs. A key node in the body’s involuntary nervous system, it carries signals between body and brain that control heart rate, digestive processes and respiration.\n\nIn a 60- to 90-minute laparoscopic procedure, physicians trained to implant the new device will attach its electrical leads to the anterior and posterior trunks of the vagus nerve, right at the gastric junction. During a patient’s waking hours, the device is designed to alternate between delivering five-minute bursts of high-frequency energy and five minutes of inactivity. During sleep, the device powers down.\n\nBy suppressing the exchange of messages that cue hunger and ready the stomach for food, the intermittent electrical currents make most feel less hungry, feel full sooner and to feel full for longer. Most eat less and lose weight.\n\nResearchers testing the device also observed that, like bariatric surgery, it might have beneficial effects that go beyond weight loss. Suppressing signals between gut and brain on the vagus nerve appeared to improve the metabolic function of obese patients who got the device.\n\n“You actually see the effect before patients actually have had that much weight loss,” said Dr. Ken Fujioka, a Scripps Institute endocrinologist and weight management expert who conducted some of the studies that led to the EnteroMedics device. That suggests that the device may be especially beneficial for those who have developed obesity-related type 2 diabetes, he said.\n\nThe on-again, off-again nature of the Maestro device’s stimulation serves another purpose: it prevents the vagus nerve’s gut signals from going silent--a communication loss that would likely prompt the central nervous system to find a compensatory workaround.\n\nAs a result, said Lea, the Maestro device appears to be safe and effective for long-term use, and unlike surgical alterations to the digestive system, reversible. Women who have had the device implanted and became pregnant were able to have it inactivated during their pregnancy, and then reactivated afterward, he said.\n\nWhile the cost of the device has not yet been set, Lea said that getting the device implanted and activated will likely cost “somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000""--an amount that is more than gastric banding but less some of the most complex gastric bypass surgery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has begun negotiations with private insurers, and the device has been been recognized as “exploratory” by the board that sets policy for Medicare reimbursements, and Lea expressed hope that some might agree to cover the procedure as early as later this year.\n\nWatching the nation’s weight as well as your own? Me too. Follow me on Twitter @LATMelissaHealy and “like” Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.']","This story was strong in explaining how a new, surgically implanted weight loss device is thought to work. But it didn’t caution readers about potential harms of the procedure — a significant omission.","The FDA announced January 14 that it had given the green light to EnteroMedics’ Maestro Rechargeable System, an implantable medical device to reduce food cravings in obese adults. The device, a vagal nerve stimulator, was widely heralded last week as the first new medical device for obesity to be approved in a decade.
This story carefully and admirably explains the mechanics behind the device but falls short in describing the amount of weight loss achieved and the side effects — some of them serious — that occurred among the patient volunteers. It also neglects to mention which patients would not be good candidates for the surgery, of which there are many. The article also includes no views from independent experts. In related media coverage, such experts have drawn attention to a number of concerns about the device and how well it’s likely to work in the real world.

But that test often produces false positives and leads to unnecessary biopsies. More than a million men in the U.S. undergo a prostate biopsy each year, and fewer than half of the patients actually have prostate cancer. The test is also thought to lead to over-treatment of prostate cancer. Studies show that an estimated 23% to 44% of all prostate tumors found through PSA testing would never have caused any symptoms.\n\nThe new test appears to be better at detecting prostate cancer and determining which cancers will be aggressive.\n\n\n\n“Many more men have elevated PSA than actually have cancer, but it can be difficult to determine this without a biopsy,” the senior author of the study, Arul Chinnaiyan, said in a news release. “This test will help in this regard. The hope is that this test could be an intermediate step before getting a biopsy.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers at the University of Michigan looked at urine samples of 1,312 men who had suspicious PSA levels and had gone on to have a biopsy or surgery to remove the prostate. The urine samples were examined for a marker indicating prostate cancer, a fusion of two genes called TMPRSS2:ERG. This gene fusion is found in about half of all cases of prostate cancer. Researchers also looked for another marker, a prostate cancer antigen called PCA3.\n\nThe two urine markers together were able to reliably predict whether the patient had prostate cancer and suggested which men were at higher risk of aggressive disease. The researchers ranked the men into low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk groups based on the urine-test scores. The biopsies showed 21% of the low-risk men had cancer compared to 43% of the medium-risk group and 69% of the high-risk group. Seven percent of the men in the low-risk group had aggressive cancer compared to 40% in the high-risk group.\n\nMost of the patients were white, so further studies are needed to see if the test is as accurate in other racial and ethnic groups. Moreover, future studies should examine how well the test works in men who have not had PSA tests first.\n\nThe paper was published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReturn to Booster Shots blog.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Gets off to bad start with inaccurate headline.

And with rates of those diseases rising, experts say that more primary care physicians—not neurology experts—will have the task of identifying these patients early so they can take advantage of whatever early interventions might be available.\n\n“If we had a simple blood test, a cholesterol test for Alzheimer’s disease, that would help,” says Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the Mayo Clinic, “but we don’t.” But Petersen has a potential solution, and according to a new paper released Wednesday in the journal Neurology, his Alzheimer’s test has promise.\n\nPetersen and his team wanted to develop a test that any physician can administer to patients, without the need for any new technology or expensive equipment. Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. “What we are trying to do is give them some help so they can be as efficient as possible without ignoring these important cognitive issues,” he says.\n\nIn the first phase of the test, his researchers simply collected information from 1,500 patients’ medical charts—their age, family history of Alzheimer’s, factors such as diabetes or smoking that have been linked to Alzheimer’s, and whether the patient had ever reported problems with memory.\n\nIn the next phase they studied the results of the patient’s basic mental exam as well as of a psychiatric evaluation, because depression and anxiety have been connected to Alzheimer’s.\n\nAnd another factor that emerged as important in developing the disease—how quickly the participant could walk a short distance. “We were a little surprised,” says Petersen. “But what’s nice about it is that it’s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it’s looking at another aspect of brain function.”\n\nMORE: This Alzheimer’s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer\n\nPetersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. Only if they show such changes — a slower walk, for example, or worsening signs of depression or memory issues — should they move on to the third phase of the test, which is a blood analysis. That would look for known genetic factors linked to Alzheimer’s, including the presence of certain versions of the ApoE gene.\n\nCurrently, the only way to truly separate out those on the road to Alzheimer’s is to conduct expensive imaging tests of the brain, or to do a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that extracts spinal fluid for signs of the amyloid protein that builds up in the disease. “We have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it’s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,” says Petersen.\n\nGet The Brief.

But those who scored higher on the test of risk factors had a seven-fold higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment than those with lower scores.\n\nFor now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn’t much they can do to interrupt the process.

Results of two different investigational arms of a multi-drug phase II trial conducted in part by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the Abramson Cancer Center, show that use of new targeted therapies neratinib or a combination of veliparib and carboplatin improves outcomes, when used in addition to standard chemotherapy before surgery for patients with HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively. The results are part of the multi-institutional I-SPY 2 study.\n\n“Compared to standard therapies alone, the drugs tested in the trial substantially reduced the presence of residual disease in the breast tissue and lymph nodes (known as achieving pathological complete response, or “pCR”) when administered before surgery,” said Angela DeMichele, MD, MSCE, a professor of Hematology-Oncology and Epidemiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a co-investigator and Chair of Trial Operations for the study, known as I-SPY 2. “pCR strongly predicts prevention of later recurrence of incurable metastatic disease. These results suggest that neratinib and veliparib-carboplatin are very promising treatment options for patients with HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively. In addition, the platform used for the I-SPY 2 trial allows the research team to test these and other new therapies simultaneously, targeting tumor subtypes that would be most likely to benefit from the therapies, minimizing the exposure of patients to treatments that are not likely to work for their disease subtype and accelerating drug development”\n\nThe data presented in the two NEJM articles shows that when added to standard, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the combination of the molecularly targeted experimental drug veliparib plus carboplatin showed sufficient improvement to meet the pre-specified threshold for “graduation” from the trial, signifying a high likelihood for success in a modest, confirmatory phase 3 neoadjuvant trial in the triple negative subset. Likewise, the experimental drug neratinib was found to have sufficient improvement in the pCR rate for patients in the HER2-positive/HR-negative subset, that it too was “graduated” from the I-SPY 2 trial.\n\n“Because there are so many subtypes of breast cancer, and because we always test drugs in the metastatic and then adjuvant setting, finding effective therapies is a very difficult and long process. The I-SPY 2 platform allows therapies to be tested and evaluated in more expeditious, cost-effective ways,” said Laura J. Esserman, MD, MBA, a professor of Surgery and Radiology and director of the Carol Franc Buck Breast Care Center at UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Francisco, Principal Investigator on the I-SPY 2 trial and a senior author on the reports. “These results provide valuable information on which drugs should proceed to confirmatory trials to improve outcomes for patients with extremely aggressive cancers that put women at risk for early recurrence and death. For these patients, time is of the essence. In particular, finding drug combinations that are effective and less toxic is extremely important. The new studies show that by using the I-SPY 2 model to match therapies with biomarker subsets, we can create trials that are more focused, smaller, and faster, thereby exposing more patients to effective treatments.”\n\nA major achievement in the progression of I-SPY 2 has been significantly reducing the time it takes to move forward from initiation of discussions with drug companies to enrollment of the first patients. I-SPY 2 has compressed this timeline from an average timeframe of 18 - 36 months to five months. The I-SPY 2 study start-up period takes approximately 45-60 days, with more than 50 percent of the sites opening and enrolling patients, as opposed to the traditional study start-up timing of 10 to 13 months, with less than 25 percent of the sites opening and enrolling.\n\nMore than 45 investigators, from the nation’s most prestigious and innovative cancer research centers, co-authored the two NEJM articles, with hundreds of staff and investigators involved in I-SPY 2 overall. In addition to Dr. Esserman, the Principal Investigators for I-SPY 2 is Donald A. Berry, PhD, a professor in the department of Biostatistics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and founder of Berry Consultants. A complete list of the participating centers and investigators is provided in a Supplementary Appendix available at NEJM.org.\n\nThe I-SPY 2 Trial is sponsored by QuantumLeap Healthcare Collaborative, a non-profit foundation that was established in 2005 as a collaboration between medical researchers at University of California at San Francisco, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. QuantumLeap’s mission is to accelerate transfer of high-impact research in clinical processes and systems technology into widespread adoption so that patients and physicians can benefit from the research as soon as practicable. QuantumLeap provides operational, financial and regulatory oversight to I-SPY 2 and is also the sponsor of the I-SPY Phase 1 program and I-SPY 3, a companion phase 3 confirmatory trial that is in development.']","If it’s not too soon to promote via news release, it’s not to soon to provide numbers backing up the claims.","This Penn Medicine news release describes two trials of experiemental breast cancer treatments, neratinib and veliparib with carboplatin, with potential to be used alongside chemotherapy to eradicate residual cancer cells before an operation to remove a breast cancer tumor for patients with aggressive HER2-positive or triple negative breast cancer.
While neglecting to mention alternative treatments already available, and some serious side-effects of neratinib treatment, the news release does a decent job of not over-claiming for the results of these phase 2 trials. The trials measured the likelihood that the treatments would be successful in larger phase 3 trials, and the news release comes close to claiming this research milestone has important implications for patients and doctors, which would have been unjustified.
The news release does a good job of highlighting why these potential new breast cancer treatments might be important, but should be weighted with the major proviso of waiting on the results of phase 3 trials.

It is found throughout the human body, with high concentrations in the liver, adrenal glands and brain.\n\nThe latest research, conducted by investigators at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is important not only because it suggests another treatment option for patients with depression, but because it also offers news clues into the physical pathways of depression that could ultimately lead to more effective treatments.\n\n“There are many directions in research that this opens up,” said Dr. George I. Papakostas, director of treatment resistant depression studies at Mass General and the study’s lead author. “It provides clues to new treatments, and it provides clues to understanding what causes depression as well as what goes on biochemically when people get better from depression.”\n\nThe researchers studied the use of SAMe or a placebo in 73 adults with depression who were not responding to prescription antidepressant treatment. All of the study subjects continued to take the prescription antidepressant, but 39 of them were randomly assigned to receive SAMe for six weeks. The remaining 34 patients received a placebo in addition to their regular prescription treatment.\n\nAfter six weeks of treatment, 36 percent of the patients taking a combination of SAMe and an antidepressant showed improvement, compared to just 18 percent of those taking the antidepressant and placebo. And about 26 percent of patients in the SAMe group experienced a complete remission of symptoms, compared to just 12 percent in the placebo group, according to a report published in The American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nThe research offers hope to patients who haven’t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. Studies suggest that for more than half of depressed patients, antidepressants alone don’t eliminate symptoms. As a result, doctors are looking for additional treatments to help these patients, referred to as “nonresponders.”\n\nModern antidepressants essentially work by building up concentrations of neurotransmitters, which amplifies their effect on the brain. It’s not clear exactly how SAMe works to curb depression, but researchers have several theories. SAMe may influence the expression of genes involved in depression or alter the function of different receptors and structures that transport neurotransmitters in the brain. The molecule also may be directly involved in the creation of neurotransmitters.\n\n“Most antidepressants we use are acting on neurotransmitters in the brain,” said Dr. J. Craig Nelson, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of an editorial accompanying the study. “It may be that SAMe is facilitating the synthesis of the neurotransmitters that the drugs then act on. That’s probably the best hypothesis.”\n\nOther studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. A 2002 analysis of depression trials conducted by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality found that SAMe use resulted in clinically meaningful benefits to depressed patients compared to placebo, and that the supplement worked as well as tricyclic antidepressants, a category of prescription drugs.\n\nIn his editorial, Dr. Nelson notes that SAMe is typically not covered by insurance companies, and that although the cost is relatively low, it is still more than the drug co-payments required by most health plans. A monthly supply of the same brand of supplement studied would be about $143, the editorial notes.\n\nDr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. Dr. Papakostas agrees the study “needs replication” but said he is hopeful about the potential for future research.\n\n“It’s a huge advancement in terms of expanding the types of medications we have to treat depression,” Dr. Papakostas said. “In the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism. It’s a medication that works differently than everything else.”\n\nThe study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health, but the SAMe pills and placebo pills were provided by the dietary supplement maker Pharmavite. Dr. Papkostas, Dr. Nelson and other researchers involved in the study all disclosed several financial relationships with makers of prescription antidepressants.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""> The 3-star score may be deceptively high at first glance. At least 3 criteria we rated satisfactory could have gone either way.  Read full review to get full perspective. </span>","The blog also oversells the meaning of this preliminary research, failing to add much balance to the lead author’s unbounded hopes, overtly drumming up public excitement for something that hasn’t been proven. “The research offers hope to patients who haven’t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment.” This statement is almost a slogan, and it’s unnecessary considering that this was a single, small, early, short-term, single-center study of a select group of nonresponders. But because this is the NY Times, the research will offer hope to readers…because the NY Times told us so.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nResearchers at Britain’s Warwick University and the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) found that men whose index finger is longer than their ring finger were one-third less likely to develop the disease than men with the opposite pattern of finger lengths.\n\n“Relative finger length could be used as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly in men aged under 60,” said Ros Eeles from the ICR, who helped lead the study.\n\nShe said the finding, which the scientists believe may be related to levels of the male hormone testosterone, could be used in combination with other factors such as family history or genetic testing to select at-risk men for screening.\n\nScreening for prostate cancer is controversial because the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests used cannot differentiate between men with aggressive cancer and those who would never have symptoms or need treatment.\n\nA study in the United States last year found routine prostate cancer screening there had resulted in more than one million men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.\n\nIn the latest study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, Eeles’s team explained that the relative length of index and ring fingers is set before birth and is believed to relate to the levels of sex hormones to which a baby is exposed in the womb.\n\nThe researchers said they believed that being exposed to less testosterone before birth helped protect against prostate cancer later in life. The phenomenon was believed to occur because genes known as HOXA and HOXD controlled finger length and the development of sex organs, they said.\n\nHORMONE LEVELS\n\nPrevious studies have linked finger length to aggression, fertility, sporting ability and confidence and reaction times.\n\n“Our study indicates it is the hormone levels that babies are exposed to in the womb that can have an effect decades later,” said Ken Muir of Warwick University, who co-led the research.\n\nProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men after lung cancer and kills around 254,000 men a year worldwide.\n\nRelated Coverage Prostate cancer: Watching and waiting may be best\n\nThe scientists questioned more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients at three British hospitals between 1994 and 2009 and compared them with 3,000 healthy men. The men were shown pictures of different finger length patterns and asked to identify the one most similar to their own.\n\nThe most common pattern, which was seen in more than half the men in the study, was a shorter index than ring finger, the researchers reported.\n\nMen whose index and ring fingers were the same length — about 19 percent of those studied — had a similar prostate cancer risk, but men whose index fingers were longer than their ring finger were 33 percent less likely to have prostate cancer.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">We see this story as another example of some of the pro-screening madness exhibited in so many news stories.  Unquestioning.

It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a 50-50 chance of surviving the next six months.\n\n""Yeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,"" she says.\n\nWhat Belvin didn\'t know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both men\'s careers.)\n\nAllison\'s treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin\'s life.\n\n""It\'s a new modality for treating cancer,"" Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of Allison\'s pioneering research. ""It used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer — surgery, radiation and chemotherapy — or some combination of those three. It\'s fair to say there\'s now a fourth option.""\n\nAllison\'s long search for this new kind of treatment — one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients — began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAt the time, he was what you could call a research scientist\'s research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system — T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can ""protect us against just about anything,"" Allison says.\n\nT cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness.\n\nHe and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do — shrink the tumors and kill the cancer.\n\nAllison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared.\n\n""These mice were cured,"" Allison says.\n\nCancer cured?\n\n""I\'ve been doing this sort of stuff for years, and I\'d never seen anything like that,"" Allison says. ""And I thought, \'If we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.\' ""\n\nAllison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach.\n\nBut the biotech companies he met with didn\'t bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different.\n\n""This was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,"" he says. ""We weren\'t trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.""\n\nThanks, but no thanks, the companies told him.\n\n""I got very depressed,"" Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board.\n\nEventually, a scientist attending one of Allison\'s research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of Allison\'s therapy, and was willing to give it a try.\n\nIt took a decade, but eventually Allison\'s big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug — now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short — was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\nAllison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering.\n\nAs it happens, Belvin was also in New York — a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma; it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body.\n\nBelvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasn\'t even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment.\n\n""Sharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. It\'s something you should consider,"" Wolchok told her.\n\nBelvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at Belvin\'s follow-up appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: ""Sharon, you no longer have cancer.""\n\nAnd in the next breath, Belvin recalls, ""he goes, \'Oh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?\' ""\n\n""Yes, of course I want to meet him!"" she told her doctor.\n\nWolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic — a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldn\'t imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug.\n\nBelvin says she tried not to tackle him. ""It was hard to control myself,"" she says. ""I owe this man my life.""\n\nBelvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. ""It really meant a lot,"" he says. ""It reminded me what it\'s all about at the end of the day.""\n\nThat was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.\n\nIppy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science.\n\nHe\'s become well-known among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease.\n\nAllison can\'t really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patient\'s own cells to destroy tumors won\'t work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can\'t, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment.\n\nIt might be too early to say we\'re going to cure cancer, Allison says, ""but we\'re going to cure certain types of cancers. We\'ve got a shot at it now.""']","While the story plays up the significant benefits the cancer drug ipilimumab can provide for some patients, it also gives readers an unrealistic set of expectations.","Immunotherapy researcher Jim Allison. Credit: MD Anderson Cancer Center
The story provides an overview of researcher Jim Allison and his role in developing the cancer immunotherapy treatment drug ipilimumab (also referred to as “Ippy”) that is used in treating some melanoma cases.
It is an interesting story, and holds the reader’s attention. However, while the story plays up the significant benefits ipilimumab can provide for some people (drawn heavily from one patient’s heartwarming success story), it also gives readers an unrealistic set of expectations. Ipilimumab doesn’t have the same benefits for all patients, and it can be both extremely expensive and cause significant adverse side effects. That doesn’t take anything away from Allison’s accomplishments, but it may mislead readers who are either battling with melanoma or who have loved ones facing a melanoma diagnosis.
We applaud Jim Allison’s work, and think it’s worthwhile to draw attention to what he has accomplished through his development of ipilimumab. However, we think it’s important to clarify the limitations of ipilimumab, as well as its potential. When many readers (or listeners) may be people who are desperate for treatment options that can give them hope, it’s critical that they receive a clear picture of what that hope may look like–and that it isn’t a cure-all.

Data from nearly 9,500 people on five continents shows that amyloid can appear 20 to 30 years before symptoms of dementia, that the vast majority of Alzheimer’s patients have amyloid and that the ApoE4 gene, known to increase Alzheimer’s risk, greatly accelerates amyloid accumulation.\n\nThe findings also confirm that amyloid screening, by PET scan or cerebral spinal fluid test, can help identify people for clinical trials of drugs to prevent Alzheimer’s. Such screening is increasingly used in research. Experts say previous trials of anti-amyloid drugs on people with dementia failed because their brains were already too damaged or because some patients, not screened for amyloid, may not have had Alzheimer’s.\n\n“The papers indicate that amyloid imaging is important to be sure that the drugs are being tested on people who have amyloid,” said Dr. Roger Rosenberg, the director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, who wrote an editorial about the studies.']","This story sends readers off with the right take-home message, but could have done with a few more caveats and a better look at the big picture regarding the role of amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease.","This story describes the findings from two related reports on the early detection of brain plaque as a harbinger of Alzheimer’s disease. For both studies, researchers in the Netherlands analyzed data from the brain scans of 9,500 volunteers from five countries and confirmed previous findings suggesting that the presence of amyloid, a type of protein, plays a role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Researchers also concluded from the data that scanning for amyloid can help predict who will develop AD 20 or 30 years before any symptoms appear.
The story’s bottom-line message about this research is accurate in that it warns against widespread screening for Alzheimer’s before we have an effective treatment. The story also includes three different independent perspectives on the research, which is a strong point in the coverage and — interestingly — a source of potential concern. In several instances, these experts are given free rein to discuss their professional theories when interpreting the data. But there’s not enough acknowledgment that their comments represent informed speculation rather than evidence-based fact. The reliance on conjecture is a strong reminder how much is still to be uncovered about this disease before safe and effective treatments can advance.

But please give some to my kid anyway.\n\nNow two new studies (bolstered by an accompanying editorial) in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrate what we parents have suspected for years: When it comes to ear infections, antibiotics are in order.\n\nCurrent practice guidelines for treating kids\' mild middle-ear infections -- or acute otitis media -- call for watchful waiting, to be followed by antibiotics only if symptoms worsen or don\'t cease. That sounds fine in theory, but it\'s a tough pill to swallow when it\'s your own wee one who\'s wailing and writhing in pain. Ear infections hurt, and waiting for them to run their course can be excruciating.\n\nBoth of the studies, in contrast to earlier research on which the ""watchful waiting"" approach has been based, are considered well-designed, even if they are on the small side. Both show that antibiotics are more effective than placebos in relieving ear-infection symptoms such as fever, poor appetite, decreased activity and irritability and suggested that their benefits warrant their being administered early on, regardless of the seeming severity of a child\'s symptoms. Interestingly, antibiotics were no more effective at reducing pain, as reported by parents or children, than placebos.\n\nOne of the studies noted that while antibiotics -- specifically, amoxicillin paired with clavulanate -- shortened the duration of symptoms, half the children on placebo eventually got better without the aid of those drugs. Still, some of the placebo-group kids required ""rescue treatment"" when their symptoms grew markedly worse.\n\nThe studies also noted that the use of antibiotics must be weighed against the risk of antimicrobial resistance, to which prescriptions for childhood maladies such as ear infections are thought to contribute mightily, and against antibiotics\' side effects, which can include diarrhea and eczema.\n\nAs it happens, on Christmas Eve, my daughter (who, at 17, is wee no more) woke up with a wicked pain in her ear. Her doctor took one quick look inside and wrote a prescription for Augmentin, a popular drug that combines amoxicillin with clavulanate potassium. By Christmas morning, the pain had subsided.\n\nDid I feel guilty for potentially contributing to the development of a superbug? The thought never crossed my mind. It doesn\'t tend to, when you\'re worried about your kid -- and grateful when her pain goes away.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Sometimes bloggers may feel they don’t get a fair shake in our systematic reviews in comparison with longer newspaper pieces.  Well, in a head-to-head comparison with a </span>","Overall, we reviewed four pieces on this study.  All the others (CNN, LA Times, NPR) got four star reviews.

Inflammation can make urination difficult.\n\n""This study shows that if we treat the gum disease, it can improve the symptoms of prostatitis and the quality of life for those who have the disease,"" said Nabil Bissada, chair of Case Western Reserve\'s Department of Periodontics and the new study\'s corresponding author.\n\nThe researchers reported their findings in the Dentistry article, ""Periodontal Treatment Improves Prostate Symptoms and Lowers Serum PSA in Men with High PSA and Chronic Periodontitis."" Naif Alwithanani, a graduate student in the dental school, led the investigation as part of his residency in periodontics.\n\nBissada explained that gum disease not only affects the mouth, but is a system-wide condition that can cause inflammation in various parts of the body. The dental school has previously found a link between gum disease and fetal deaths, rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease.\n\nThe new prostate study\n\nResearchers studied 27 men, 21 years old and older. Each had had a needle biopsy within the past year that confirmed inflammation of the prostate gland, and a blood test that showed elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels--possible signs of inflammation and cancer.\n\nThe men were assessed for symptoms of prostate disease by answering questions on the International-Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) test about their quality of life and possible urination issues.\n\nResearchers found 21 of the 27 participants had no or mild inflammation, but 15 had biopsy-confirmed malignancies. Two had both inflammation and a malignancy.\n\nThe men also had to have at least 18 teeth and were examined for signs of gum disease, such as increased levels of inflammation and bleeding and/or loose teeth due to attachment and bone loss.\n\nAll the men had moderate to severe gum disease, for which they received treatment. They were tested again for periodontal disease four to eight weeks later and showed significant improvement.\n\nDuring the periodontal care, the men received no treatment for their prostate conditions. But even without prostate treatment, 21 of the 27 men showed decreased levels of PSA. Those with the highest levels of inflammation benefited the most from the periodontal treatment. Six participants showed no changes.\n\nSymptom scores on the IPSS test also showed improvement.\n\nBissada is now conducting follow-up research to support the first study\'s findings. He hopes to make periodontal treatment a standard part of treating prostate disease, much like cardiac patients are often encouraged to visit their dentist before undergoing heart procedures and a dental checkup is advised for women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy.\n\n###\n\nCase Western Reserve dental researchers Nishant Joshi, Catherine Demko and Robert Skillicorn; and University Hospitals Case Medical Center researchers Donald Bodner, Lee Ponsky, Sanjay Gupta and Gregory T. MacLennan contributed to the study.']","Small numbers, confounding factors not assessed, no control group — the list of limitations goes on. This was a very preliminary study that didn’t deserve the attention this news release gave to it.","This news release from Case Western Reserve University sets out to describe a relatively small study designed to further previous evidence for an observed link between gum disease and prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate). The study focuses on the likely common denominator of a body-wide biological process that releases inflammatory cytokines into blood and tissue, along with other possibilities; and on the clear possibility that non-surgical dental treatment will help. The study report in the journal Dentistry goes to some lengths to caution readers about the very shaky nature of this evidence and the fact that the study was not designed to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between periodontitis (the fancy name for inflammatory gum disease) and high PSA levels in the blood of men with prostatitis symptoms. The study authors also lay out several caveats and limitations of their study, including the small number of participants and lack of a control group. Alas, the release fails to exercise that same wise caution. It misleadingly refers to PSA reductions that were not statistically significant, and states flatly that “Treating gum disease reduced symptoms of prostate inflammation.” This overstates the value of the evidence presented in the study.

Procedural sedation is commonly used for painful or uncomfortable procedures like setting fractures, repairing lacerations and draining abscesses in emergency departments worldwide.\n\n""Although sedation-related serious adverse events occur infrequently, recognition and early intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety,"" said Dr. Maala Bhatt, lead author, director of pediatric emergency research at CHEO, and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. ""We\'ve been able to identify sedation medications and practices associated with the best clinical outcomes, which is practice-changing.""\n\nAccording to the authors, this study represents the largest and most robust prospective emergency department procedural sedation cohort to date. It includes children from six emergency departments across Canada, sedated with six different medication combinations.\n\nThe results of the study show that choice of sedation medication had the biggest impact on the incidence of adverse events and need for significant interventions in response to those events. The incidence of serious adverse events was lowest among patients sedated with ketamine-alone and highest among patients sedated with combination drugs ketamine plus propofol or fentanyl.\n\nThe overall incidence of adverse events in the study population was 11.7%. The most common events were a decrease in oxygen saturation (5.6%) and vomiting (5.2%). Significant interventions in response to an adverse event were rare, occurring in only 1.4% of children. Two other practices - receiving an opioid prior to sedation and having a laceration repair - were associated with the occurrence of vomiting, oxygen desaturation and need for significant interventions.\n\n""The low rate of serious adverse events and significant interventions supports the safety of procedural sedation in the hands of emergency department physicians,"" said Dr. Bhatt. ""While all sedation medications and combination of medications are effective and safe in the hands of experienced providers, ketamine-alone is associated with the fewest serious adverse events and significant interventions, making it a logical choice for providing procedural sedation for children in emergency departments.""\n\n###\n\nCo-authors include: Drs.

He is a professor of fetal medicine at Kings College Hospital in London.\n\nBut he added, ""This condition is, to a great extent, preventable.""\n\nThe new study looked at an aspirin dose of 150 milligrams (mg) per day because some past studies with smaller daily doses of aspirin have produced conflicting results, according to Nicolaides. A baby aspirin dose is 81 milligrams.\n\nIn those studies using smaller doses, the reduction in preeclampsia risk hovered around 10 percent, he said, but the higher dose in this latest study was linked to a 62 percent reduction in risk.\n\nPreeclampsia is a serious high blood pressure disorder. It can affect all of the organs in a woman\'s body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but certain risk factors make it more likely to occur, including:\n\nA past history of preeclampsia,\n\nBeing pregnant with more than one baby,\n\nHaving longstanding high blood pressure,\n\nHaving chronic conditions, such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and kidney problems.\n\nDr. Mitchell Kramer, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Huntington Hospital in New York, said he\'d add women who are severely obese and women who\'ve had babies who had restricted growth to the list of women at high risk of preeclampsia.\n\nACOG already recommends that women who are at high risk of preeclampsia take a low-dose baby aspirin beginning between 12 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbout 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Just under 800 were randomly put into the daily aspirin group, while just over 800 were placed in the placebo group. The women came from 13 different maternity hospitals across Europe and Israel.\n\nInstead of relying solely on standard risk factors, the researchers combined those risk factors with measurements of maternal blood flow, blood pressure and two hormones produced by the placenta. They used an algorithm they designed to combine all those factors to select women who they believed were at a high risk of preeclampsia.\n\nBetween 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. They continued taking the pills until they were 36 weeks\' pregnant, or sooner if they delivered the baby early.\n\nJust 13 women in the aspirin group developed preeclampsia, while 35 women in the placebo group developed the complication, the findings showed.\n\nThe reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Women who delivered at less than 34 weeks were 82 percent less likely to have preeclampsia if they were taking 150 mg of aspirin, Nicolaides said.\n\nThere were no serious side effects for expectant mothers, or adverse events for the babies related to aspirin use during pregnancy, the researchers noted.\n\nHowever, as with all drugs, women should talk to their doctor about the use of aspirin in pregnancy before taking up this regimen, because aspirin does increase the risk for bleeding.\n\nNicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.\n\nAccording to Kramer, ""This randomized study concludes that [aspirin\'s] use is not only effective for reducing the incidence of preeclampsia at term, but also preterm. This is important because it will reduce the need for preterm delivery, which is risky for the baby.""\n\nLow-dose aspirin can also help reduce the chances of eclampsia, which is seizures due to preeclampsia for high-risk women, Kramer noted.\n\nThe study is scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the Fetal Medicine Foundation meeting in Slovenia. The findings were also published simultaneously in a special online issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about preeclampsia, visit the March of Dimes.']",We especially liked that the story gave us the absolute risk reduction so we see a more accurate assessment of the intervention’s benefits.,"This story from HealthDay does a good job of explaining the benefits, harms and quality of the evidence from the study, which assessed aspirin’s ability to prevent preeclampsia in certain women who are deemed high risk.
However, we wish the story had made it more clear that this benefit was only significant in births that occurred before 37 weeks of pregnancy. After 37 weeks, the preeclampsia rates were similar in both groups–so it was of minimal to no benefit women in this timeframe, which is when most preeclampsia occurs.
Prevention of pre-term preeclampsia is thought to be particularly beneficial because it may reduce complications from premature births. But women and babies can still be harmed when preeclampsia develops after 37 weeks.
We also took issue with this quote from the lead researcher:  “This condition is, to a great extent, preventable.”
This is only somewhat true for pre-term preeclampsia among women who have been identified to be high-risk and receive treatment. Most women who develop preeclampsia have no risk factors and therefore will probably not be taking aspirin to prevent it from occurring. And even among high-risk women, it only reduces risk–it doesn’t eliminate it.

Beyond the obvious unpleasantness, there\'s the small but real risk of complications that in rare cases can lead to hospitalization or even death.\n\nThat\'s why the American Cancer Society and other groups recommend that people screened for colorectal cancer using a colonoscopy wait a decade in between tests if no polyps or other signs of potential cancer are found. Polyps are slow-growing, and the benefits of being screened more frequently than that don\'t seem to outweigh the risks.\n\nA new study, however, suggests that a significant percentage of Medicare patients are having screening colonoscopies more frequently than that, for no apparent medical reason. Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch found that among 24,071 Medicare enrollees who had a negative screening colonoscopy between 2001 and 2003, almost 24% were re-examined within seven years ""with no clear indication for the early repeated examination.""\n\nThe researchers also found geographic variations, with more than 50% of patients receiving unexplained follow-ups in some areas (including Pueblo, Colo., and Bryan, Texas) and less than 5% in others. Patients in New England and the Pacific and Mountain areas were less likely to have an early repeated procedure.\n\nJames Goodwin, an author of the study and director of the Sealy Center on Aging at the University of Texas Medical Branch, tells the Health Blog it\'s not clear why patients are being screened too often, but that ""any time you have a fee-for-service system, there\'s a risk for overutilizing services that are well-reimbursed."" In addition, he says the health community has been ""a little too good in terms of selling the message of screening"" for cancer. ""There really is an excellent acceptance of the benefits of cancer screening in this country, but I don\'t think we\'ve educated [people] well enough"" about the possible risks.\n\nDurado Brooks, director of prostate and colorectal cancers at the American Cancer Society, says that the study is ""extraordinarily well done."" He says many physicians worry about missing a potential cancer and underestimate the risks of screening, which are even higher for older people with underlying health problems.\n\nWhile Medicare has clear rules against reimbursing for screening colonoscopy within ten years of a negative result, researchers said only 2% of the claims with no indication were rejected by the government insurance program. (We have asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to comment on this point and update this post when they do.)\n\nGoodwin notes that besides increasing the odds of harm, overuse of screening in some people ties up physicians and resources that could be better used elsewhere. Only about half of eligible adults are being screened for colorectal cancer -- by any method. The ACS says some screening tests can find the polyps that may turn into cancer; besides colonoscopy every ten years, those include flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast barium enema or CT colonoscopy every five years.\n\nImage: iStockphoto']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was a smart, concise blog post that captured the essence of the important new analysis accurately and adequately.  </span>","Its few shortcomings could have been overcome easily with a little more space:

Graves.\n\nPhysicians will ""be able to use a simple blood test and then know that this woman is at increased risk or reduced risk of a preterm birth,"" said Graves, whose laboratory performed the research in the study.\n\nAbout 10 percent of births are premature, and the rate rises to 30 percent among women who have already had a baby prematurely, Graves said. Premature birth can lead to a long list of medical problems and puts babies at risk of dying.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers examined blood samples from 80 women who went on to have normal births and 80 who had premature births. They tried to find signs in the blood that indicate what kind of birth the women would have.\n\nThe researchers developed a screening method that looked for so-called peptide biomarkers in the blood that -- in tandem with several other proteins -- predicted 80 percent to 90 percent of the premature births at 28 weeks of gestation. The false positive rate -- referring to tests that wrongly indicated premature birth -- was 20 percent.\n\nThe test wasn\'t as effective at 24 weeks of gestation.\n\n""This may simply indicate that some of the causes for preterm birth may not pre-exist before the pregnancy,"" Graves said. ""Most probably don\'t, but develop or become apparent as the pregnancy progresses. The closer to the preterm birth, the more likely you are to have significant changes in the physiology of the woman that is observed in the blood.""\n\nThe test may cost $150 to $250, Graves said. It would require several years to go through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process. BYU and the University of Utah have a patent on the test and have licensed it.\n\nEven if the test is found to indicate that a birth will be premature, physicians would have limited options. One option is to provide drugs that dampen the immune system so the baby\'s lungs develop faster, said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nWu said the study results are promising, but more research is needed to confirm that the test is reliable. ""If you are going to be alarming a patient by saying that she may have premature delivery, you want to make sure that\'s truly the case.""\n\nThe study appears in the May issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about premature birth, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","Not a bad summary of a new study, written clearly and succinctly.

Carpenter, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.\n\nDr. Mary E. Olson, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, who has worked to promote approaches to psychosis that are less reliant on drugs, said the combined treatment had a lot in common with Open Dialogue, a Finnish program developed in the 1980s. “These are zeitgeist ideas, and I think it’s thrilling that this trial got such good results,” Dr. Olson said.\n\nIn the new study, doctors used the medications as part of a package of treatments and worked to keep the doses as low as possible minimizing their bad effects. The sprawling research team, led by Dr. John M. Kane, chairman of the psychiatry department at Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, randomly assigned 34 community care clinics in 21 states to provide either treatment as usual, or the combined package.\n\nThe team trained staff members at the selected clinics to deliver that package, and it included three elements in addition to the medication. First, help with work or school such as assistance in deciding which classes or opportunities are most appropriate, given a person’s symptoms. Second, education for family members to increase their understanding of the disorder. And finally, one-on-one talk therapy in which the person with the diagnosis learns tools to build social relationships, reduce substance use and help manage the symptoms, which include mood problems as well as hallucinations and delusions.\n\nFor example, some patients can learn to defuse the voices in their head — depending on the severity of the episode — by ignoring them or talking back. The team recruited 404 people with first-episode psychosis, mostly diagnosed in their late teens or 20s. About half got the combined approach and half received treatment as usual. Clinicians monitored both groups using standardized checklists that rate symptom severity and quality of life, like whether a person is working, and how well he or she is getting along with family members.\n\nThe group that started on the combined treatment scored, on average, more poorly on both measures at the beginning of the trial. Over two years, both groups showed steady improvement. But by the end, those who had been in the combined program had more symptom relief, and were functioning better as well.The researchers expect to have lowered average doses in the combined program but had not yet finished analyzing that data.']",A generally solid story about an important new study of schizophrenia treatment. Readers will get most of what they need to know from this coverage.,"
Update: The Times has issued a correction to this story. The correction states that the story erroneously claimed that the experimental approach in the study used lower drug dosages. “Though it studied a program intended to reduce medication dosages, the researchers do not yet know for sure if dosages were lowered or by how much,” the correction notes.”Therefore, the study did not conclude ‘that schizophrenia patients who received smaller doses of antipsychotic medication and a bigger emphasis on one-on-one talk therapy and family support made greater strides in recovery.’ (The study did conclude that the alternative treatment program as a whole led to better outcomes.)”
We changed the headline of our review from “Times captures impact of new, less drug-intensive schizophrenia treatment” to “Times explores impact of integrated care model for schizophrenia treatment.” The correction does not affect our ratings for the story, but the references we made in the review to the lowered drug dosages are no longer appropriate and have been stricken. In addition, the tone of the review would have been more circumspect had we known that the intended reduction in drug dosages had not been confirmed by the researchers.
In a large randomized controlled trial in 34 community clinics across the U.S., researchers compared usual care for first episode psychosis with a program of integrated care that included not only drugs, but also help with school and work, family education about the problems and how best to help, as well as one-on-one talk therapy. The government (National Institute of Mental Health)-funded study found that those receiving the integrated program of care experienced more symptom relief and functioned better than those in the treatment-as-usual group. Their doses of medication were also 20-50% lower. Those receiving treatment earlier on in their psychotic episodes also did better.
The story overall does a solid job of covering the study and its implications. But we wish it had pushed a bit harder to quantify the benefits shown in the 2-year trial with some hard numbers. We applaud the discussion of federal policy and financing, but also wish there had been some discussion of the costs of therapy itself. The inclusion of a variety of perspectives on the research brings depth and nuance to the coverage.

The older people tended to have more activity in several inflammation-related genes compared with the younger group — no surprise, since as people get older, inflammation throughout the body tends to rise. Chronic diseases of aging, like diabetes, hypertension, heart problems, cancer, joint disorders and Alzheimer’s, are all believed to have inflammation in common. “Most of the diseases of aging are not really diseases of aging, per se, but rather diseases of inflammation,” Furman says. The more active these genes were, the more likely the person was to have high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.\n\nWhat’s more, even among older people, those with lower levels of these factors were more protected against inflammation — and they had something else in common too. They all drank caffeine regularly. People who drank more than five cups of coffee a day showed extremely low levels of activity in the inflammatory gene pathway. Caffeine inhibits this circuit and turns the inflammatory pathway off, the researchers say.\n\nThe goal isn’t to make every trace of inflammation disappear, the scientists stress. In fact, inflammation is an important function of the immune system, which uses it to fight off infections and remove potentially toxic compounds. But with aging, the process isn’t regulated as well as it is in a younger body. “Clearly in aging something is breaking down, and we become less effective at managing this inflammation,” says Mark Davis, director of the Stanford institute. “But now in this paper, we identify a particular pathway that was not associated with inflammation before. We are able to point, with a much higher resolution picture, at aging and the things that should be markers for inflammation.”\n\nThe key will be to figure out when the inflammatory response starts to spiral out of control. In an upcoming study, Furman and others will soon investigate the immune systems of 1,000 people; he hopes to use that information to develop a reference range of immune-system components to tell people whether their levels are normal, or if they’re at higher risk for developing chronic conditions driven by inflammation.\n\nIn the meantime, following the example of caffeine-drinking adults with lower levels of inflammation — by having a cup of joe or two — might be a good idea.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.']",In an observational study on inflammation researchers identified caffeine as having an inhibitory effect on one gene associated with inflammation. But there’s scant evidence for the article to suggest that lowering inflammation levels — or drinking coffee — will prevent diseases associated with inflammation.,"The story focuses on a recent journal article in Nature Medicine, which identified specific genes and gene modules (or groups of genes) associated with inflammation in older adults. The story notes that inflammation is associated with a number of health problems. However, the story focuses on an aspect of the research which is not given much attention in the actual journal article. Namely, the journal article notes that researchers identified caffeine as having an inhibitory effect on one of the genes associated with inflammation. But the news story translates this as meaning that drinking coffee can slow down aging. That’s a stretch. The story also uses vague — and potentially overstated — language to infer that inflammation is the causal factor for a host of diseases. While many chronic diseases are associated with inflammation, there’s little conclusive evidence that lowering inflammation levels — or drinking coffee for that matter — will prevent these diseases.

One suggestion is to replace 5% of the flour in pizza dough with dried and granulated seaweed.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of premature death globally. Ironically, many of the pathologies leading to premature death from cardiovascular diseases are not only widespread, but they are preventable.\n\nOne way to prevent cardiovascular diseases is to avoid obesity and eat healthy, leaving the responsibility with the individual consumer.\n\nBut the responsibility should also be shared by society, argues University of Southern Denmark professor of biophysics, Ole G. Mouritsen, who has authored several books on seaweed as food.\n\nProfessor Mouritsen is the co-author of an article in the journal Phycologia reviewing existing knowledge on the health effects of 35 different seaweed species.\n\nIn the article the authors offer suggestions to how both individual consumers and the food industry can use seaweed to make our everyday meals healthier.\n\n""Certain substances in seaweed may be important for reducing cardiovascular diseases. We think this knowledge should be available for society and also be put to use"", says Mouritsen.\n\nSeaweed salt is healthier salt\n\nMany seaweed species have a variety of health benefits. They contain, among other things, beneficial proteins, antioxidants, minerals, trace elements, dietary fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nSeaweed\'s content of potassium salts does not led to high blood pressure - unlike the sodium salts, typically encountered in the processed food.\n\nAn important feature is also that the seaweed has umami - the fifth basic taste, which is known to promote satiety and hence regulate food intake in addition to reduce the craving for salt, sugar and fat.\n\n""It is difficult to determine how much seaweed a person should consume to benefit from its good qualities. 5-10 grams of dried seaweed per day is my estimate"", says Professor Mouritsen.\n\nHe and the co-authors suggest that seaweed should be added fast food, thus making this type of food healthier. It can even enhance the flavor of the food, they argue. For example, dried and granulated seaweed can replace some of the flour when producing dry pasta, bread, pizza, snack bars, etc.\n\nSeaweed is also good in meat products\n\nIt is also possible to add seaweed to meat products and thereby provide the consumer with an increased intake of dietary fiber and antioxidants - or maybe the aim is lower cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the article Professor Mouritsen and his co-authors describe a study in which a group of overweight but otherwise healthy men were asked to taste bread with added dried seaweed from the species Ascophyllum nosodum. The men\'s reaction was that the bread tasted acceptable as long as the seaweed content was kept under 4%.\n\nBy eating bread containing 4% of dried seaweed the overweight men ingested more dietary fiber (4.5 g more fiber per. 100 g) than when they ate the control whole-meal bread. Another effect was that they consumed 16.4% less energy in the 24 hour period after eating the seaweed enriched bread.\n\n""We know that many people have difficulty distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy food. By adding seaweed to processed foods we can make food healthier. In many cases we also get tastier food, and it may also help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases"", the authors believe.\n\nHOW TO GET THE HEALTH BENEFITS FROM SEAWEED\n\nSeaweed contains only few calories, but is still rich in rich in essential amino acids, dietary fibers, minerals, trace elements, vitamins and polyunsaturated fats.\n\nYou can easily add up to 5% dried seaweed to a dough without losing its ability to raise.\n\nDried seaweed can be stored for months or years without loss of flavor and nutritional value.\n\nDried seaweed can be added to food as powder, granulate or pieces in pastries, egg dishes, mashed potatoes, dressings, or sprinkled on vegetables or fish dishes.\n\nPowders and granulates can be used as a salt substitute.\n\nHijiki contains arsenic, which is carcinogenic and therefore some national food authorities recommend that you do not eat it. Despite these warnings, you can buy dried hijiki in many stores.\n\nSome species may contain large amounts of iodine.\n\nNever eat seaweed that is washed up on the beach.\n\n###\n\nContact Professor Ole G.

The outcome was excellent, but the recovery was long and horrible. The orthopedist wouldn’t let me drive for six weeks, or run, swim or lift weights for three months. I suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy. It was nearly six months before I felt normal again.\n\nSo in 2014, after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an MRI revealed another rotator-cuff tear, I vowed I would not go through shoulder surgery (or its aftermath) again.\n\nCortisone injections and physical therapy didn’t help, so I decided to try something else: platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that uses the body’s natural healing properties to mend injuries. Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right.\n\nIt may not work for every condition, or for everyone. But it worked for me.\n\n[PRP therapy is popular for sports injuries, but does it work?]\n\nBefore undergoing PRP treatment, I read quite a bit about it, learning that it holds promise for healing soft-tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff (the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder), tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, patella tendinitis and hamstring tears; it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis.\n\n“[PRP] works, and the results have been amazing,’’ says John Ferrell, the sports medicine physician who treated me. “There still needs to be more research done to perfect the process, but [it] will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future. We will be more preventive. We will be able to treat ailments noninvasively, and at an earlier stage.’’\n\nThe procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient’s arm, spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing. Platelets, the blood cells that promote clotting, contain hundreds of proteins, called growth factors, that are important in repairing injuries.\n\n“PRP works by acting like a stem-cell magnet,’’ says Ferrell, who practices at Regenerative Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, which has several offices in the Washington area. “It releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come [and] help regenerate the injured area. Rotator-cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there. PRP actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal.’’\n\nA recent pilot study conducted at the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta on rotator-cuff tears supports this. It showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received PRP, as well as improvements in their pain and function.\n\nThe researchers call the results “clinically relevant,’’ despite the study’s small size, and say the next step should be a larger, controlled clinical trial. “I’ve heard some skeptics call PRP a cure looking for a disease, but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes,” says Marni Wesner, a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study’s authors. “The potential for benefit from PRP is real.’’\n\nI had my first appointment with Ferrell last October to find out whether PRP might help me. By then, my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year. It bothered me while swimming and lifting weights, and while getting dressed. By performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion, Ferrell discovered that my left shoulder — the site of the tear — was considerably weaker than my right.\n\nHe then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor. It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier.\n\nBefore deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain.\n\nI had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23. It was painful, and the aching persisted for about 36 hours. I had one bad night, followed by an uncomfortable day. After that, the pain stopped. Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder — to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks.\n\nAfter what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with.\n\nFerrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. “We want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,’’ Ferrell says.\n\nBecause there is not yet enough research on PRP — and because some studies have shown mixed results — insurance will not cover it.\n\nStill, “it has significant cost savings” compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery.\n\nWith additional research, insurance may ultimately pay for PRP. Unfortunately, there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the Food and Drug Administration to approve, such as a drug or device. The centrifuges already are licensed, and the procedure uses a patient’s own blood, which is regarded as safe. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons — which says PRP “holds great promise’’ — describes the risk as minimal.\n\nThose who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience — someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month — and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.\n\nMoreover, “you see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound,” he adds.\n\nBy February, the ultrasound showed my tear to be about 80 percent healed. The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job.\n\nI had it on March 4.\n\nWhen I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good. No pain, no problems. He rolled in the ultrasound machine, and I was not surprised by the results. The tear was completely gone.']",This first-person story on platelet-rich plasma injections for shoulder pain was replete with problems.,"This story tells the tale of the writer’s experience using a new therapy for a rotator cuff injury, a procedure called platelet-rich plasma, or PRP.  The writer previously had undergone traditional rotator cuff injury surgery and cited a long and difficult recovery, making the allegedly easier procedure and recovery from PRP more appealing.
The story is problematic on several fronts, and was concerning enough that we used it to examine the hazards of first-person reporting on health interventions in a separate blog post, “Washington Post’s story on platelet-rich plasma injections highlights drawbacks of first-person health reporting.”
In sum, it is a first-person account of one individual’s experience, not an actual report on the efficacy of a new approach to such injuries. Research-wise, it only cites, anecdotally, one tiny pilot study of the procedure and fails to provide any real data on those and other results, including a Cochrane systematic review, which is one of the most authoritative sources of evidence on hand today. It also leans heavily on quotes from the physician treating the writer, and provides no information that would convince readers that his statements are free from conflict.
It’s also important to point out a factual error in the story: Injecting lidocaine into the shoulder or another area known as the subacromia bursa numbs up more than just the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff, itself, is not injected.

Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.\n\nAs Alzheimer’s disease progresses, cognitive impairment can take an ever greater toll on communication and relationships. A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer’s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“No one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,” said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. “Some past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer’s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.”\n\nMembers of Williams’s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.\n\nIn analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they’d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate — for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners’ efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners’ versions of past events. This showed that they “value the relationship more than being right,” Williams said.\n\nSome of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer’s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.\n\n“The reality is, a person with dementia isn’t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,” Williams said. “At the same time, people with Alzheimer’s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it’s unexpected. These are moments that caregivers can cherish.”\n\nAmi Albernaz can be reached at ami.albernaz@gmail.com.']","We wanted to like this story about an important, little-discussed topic more than we did. The story earns points for going off the beaten path, but the coverage felt one-dimensional.","This story reports on a study about an important topic — how caregiver spouses of Alzheimer’s patients work at maintaining communications in their marriages despite the effects of the disease. The story nicely summarizes the researchers’ conclusions and suggests several potentially useful approaches caregivers can use to foster these relationships. But the overall coverage feels one-dimensional. The story never supports the headline claims with any kind of quantitative description of how these approaches “helped.” The story offers no independent perspective on the findings and doesn’t help readers evaluate the quality of the study.

The release highlights the findings as contributing to “mounting evidence” of caffeine’s “potentially protective” effects against dementia. It suggests caffeine consumption is very safe; the fact that the conclusions are based on “self-reported” caffeine consumption levels; and how the researchers adjusted for potentially confounding risk factors.
Several news organizations, including a Milwaukee newspaper, wrote articles based largely (sometimes almost verbatim) on the release, although most did at least make clear that the research in no way proves that drinking coffee or other heavily caffeinated beverages prevents dementia. That’s because the study is observational. As our tip for reporting on observational studies points out: “Because observational studies are not randomized, they cannot control for all of the other inevitable, often unmeasurable, exposures or factors that may actually be causing the results. Thus, any “link” between cause and effect in observational studies is speculative at best.”
The news release left out that caveat, along with known ill effects of moderately heavy caffeine intake, especially among older people. Also missing was acknowledgement of the mixed results of previous non-human animal and association studies involving coffee and cognitive impairment.

In humans and many animals the lateral sleeping position is the most common one. The buildup of brain waste chemicals may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological conditions. Their finding is published in the Journal of Neuroscience.\n\nDr. Benveniste, Principal Investigator and a Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook University School of Medicine, has used dynamic contrast MRI for several years to examine the glymphatic pathway in rodent models. The method enables researchers to identify and define the glymphatic pathway, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filters through the brain and exchanges with interstitial fluid (ISF) to clear waste, similar to the way the body’s lymphatic system clears waste from organs. It is during sleep that the glymphatic pathway is most efficient. Brain waste includes amyloid β (amyloid) and tau proteins, chemicals that negatively affect brain processes if they build up.\n\nIn the paper, “The Effect of Body Posture on Brain Glymphatic Transport,” Dr. Benveniste and colleagues used a dynamic contrast MRI method along with kinetic modeling to quantify the CSF-ISF exchange rates in anesthetized rodents’ brains in three positions – lateral (side), prone (down), and supine (up).\n\n“The analysis showed us consistently that glymphatic transport was most efficient in the lateral position when compared to the supine or prone positions,” said Dr. Benveniste. “Because of this finding, we propose that the body posture and sleep quality should be considered when standardizing future diagnostic imaging procedures to assess CSF-ISF transport in humans and therefore the assessment of the clearance of damaging brain proteins that may contribute to or cause brain diseases.”\n\nDr. Benveniste and first-author Dr. Hedok Lee, Assistant Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook developed the safe posture positions for the experiments. Their colleagues at the University of Rochester, including Lulu Xie, Rashid Deane and Maiken Nedergaard, PhD, used fluorescence microscopy and radioactive tracers to validate the MRI data and to assess the influence of body posture on the clearance of amyloid from the brains.\n\n“It is interesting that the lateral sleep position is already the most popular in human and most animals – even in the wild – and it appears that we have adapted the lateral sleep position to most efficiently clear our brain of the metabolic waste products that built up while we are awake,” says Dr. Nedergaard. “The study therefore adds further support to the concept that sleep subserves a distinct biological function of sleep and that is to ‘clean up’ the mess that accumulates while we are awake. Many types of dementia are linked to sleep disturbances, including difficulties in falling asleep. It is increasing acknowledged that these sleep disturbances may accelerate memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease. Our findng brings new insight into this topic by showing it is also important what position you sleep in,” she explained.\n\nDr. Benveniste cautioned that while the research team speculates that the human glymphatic pathway will clear brain waste most efficiency when sleeping in the lateral position as compared to other positions, testing with MRI or other imaging methods in humans are a necessary first step.\n\nOther co-authors on the paper include: Lulu Xie, Hongyi Kang, and Rashid Deane of the Center for Translational Neuromedicine, University of Rochester; Jean Logan of the Department of Radiology, New York University Langone Medical Center; and Tian Feng of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University.\n\n###']","From a study of anesthetized rodents, this release suggests that sleeping on your side “could be an important practice to help reduce the chances of developing Alzheimer’s.” We didn’t think the study could support such a statement.","The illustration that accompanied this news release on a study involving rodents.
This news release from Stony Brook University in New York describes a preliminary research finding that suggests sleeping on your side rather than in a prone (lying flat, face downward) or supine (lying face upward) position aids the elimination of metabolic waste products that build up in the brain while asleep. It’s definitely an interesting finding that supports research published in 2013 from the University of Rochester. The problem with both of these studies is that, to date, none of these findings have been replicated in humans. In reality, only about one-third of findings in animals translate to successful interventions in people. The release hints at this issue by stating that the researchers’ hunch on sleeping posture and waste-clearing efficiency is just that — speculation — and that human studies are required to know for certain.

Combining data from 20 clinical trials, which included over 1,000 patients with chronic insomnia, the authors calculated sleep improvements after C.B.T. treatment, relative to no treatment. On average, treated patients fell asleep almost 20 minutes faster and were awake in the night almost half an hour less. The total amount of time that they were sleeping when in bed increased by nearly 10 percent. These results are similar to or better than improvements from many sleep drugs, and lasted longer.\n\nMy experience is consistent with these averages. The C.B.T. treatment I received, through an online program recommended by my doctor, also included keeping careful track of how much sleep I got each night. This proved very helpful. It demonstrated progress — the nights in which I got only four or five hours of sleep became less common, and, on average, my nights of sleep lengthened by 30 minutes. My sleep log also helped me be more objective. Many nights I might have considered “bad” — and fretted over — were ones in which I got only one hour less sleep than my target of seven hours. Recognizing that’s not really so bad helped me relax, and relaxing helped me get more and better sleep.\n\nImprovements like mine and those reported in the study bring sleep statistics for those with insomnia quite close to those without it. This further emphasizes the point that many insomniacs aren’t that different from normal sleepers. Many sleep fine most nights, but also have more frequent nights of insufficient sleep than normal sleepers would experience. A big part of the difference may be how insomniacs perceive their sleep performance and the negative messages they give themselves about their poor sleep and how it will affect their daily lives.\n\nC.B.T. practitioners learn that if you label a night of sleep “bad” and expect a bad day to follow a bad night of sleep, you’re more likely to get it, as well as more likely to be anxious the next time you attempt to sleep. In this way, unless exacerbated by physical causes — like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome — insomnia is a condition of the mind that then infects the body. Like a patch on faulty software, C.B.T. reorients one’s thinking and behavior so that sleep is first thought to be, and then soon after actually is, a more positive experience. Drugs, on the other hand, just treat insomniacs’ symptoms without addressing the underlying cause, which is why the relief they provide may be less durable.\n\nFor me, and many patients, C.B.T. works. And as studies show, it works better than drugs. That moment with my children, a couple of years ago, was the last time I fell asleep reading to them.']","Using his own story as a jumping off point, the author provides a very helpful and readable overview of the evidence on insomnia treatments.","This story describes the step-by-step path of an individual patient/author seeking information to compare drugs to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating his own insomnia. It isn’t a news story about research, although it draws from a recent Annals of Internal Medicine study and other studies. The writer mixes his own personal experience with a thorough discussion of the data. The result is a very helpful and readable overview of the evidence on insomnia treatments.

Earlier lab experiments with rodents appeared to show improvement in older animals when getting such plasma. A secondary goal of this “trial” was to see if the infusions improved the mental status of Alzheimer’s patients, which it did not.

Although one of the researchers calls the work exciting, we’re not sure what he’s talking about. The study had less than a dozen participants. There was no measurable data. There is no insight into what, if anything, is in the plasma of young men that might benefit these patients. There has been no peer-reviewed publication describing the work.

Over the years her condition worsened, until a new therapy came along to help improve her brain's motor circuit.\n\nFor decades, Sharon Samuels struggled with simple everyday tasks like brushing her teeth, buttoning her shirt, putting on makeup, and eating food.\n\n“I did not want to go out socially with other people, especially people who I did not know, because I could see them looking at me. And the feeling was horrible,” she recalled. “It would take my heart away when I was trying to eat and I’d look up and they were looking at me.”\n\nSamuels, 72, has essential tremor, a movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking mostly in the hands or legs. An estimated 10 million people in the United States suffer from the condition, according to the International Essential Tremor Foundation. The disorder isn’t fatal, but it tends to get worse with age and to affect patients’ quality of life.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDoctors usually treat essential tremor with medication, but the drugs don’t work well for all patients. Now a new trial finds that a treatment to kill off neurons in a certain region of the brain can do away with tremors in some patients who don’t respond to drugs. But the procedure brings lasting side effects in some patients, and its long-term usefulness is still being studied.\n\nIn an ongoing clinical trial at 11 medical centers globally, researchers are using ultrasound waves to treat the source of essential tremor in the brain. The therapy, called focused ultrasound thalamotomy, uses the energy generated by sound waves to burn off certain cells in the thalamus, a region of the brain where the essential tremor is thought to originate.\n\nPatients are placed in an MRI machine with their head secured in place in a special helmet. They are awake as doctors aim over 1,000 low-energy ultrasound waves to create a lesion — an injury to the tissue — inside the thalamus.\n\n“As we make the test lesion, we see a subtle improvement in their tremor and the patients notice it,” said Dr. Rees Cosgrove who is leading the trial at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Brigham is one of the six centers running the trial in the US.\n\n“As we enlarge the lesion, the tremor just stops and they’ll just look at their hand. It has been shaking for years and they look at it as though, ‘Hmm, is this really my hand?’ It’s really a remarkable moment.”\n\nFor Samuels, who underwent the procedure on June 29, the recovery has been surprising. She had been taking tremor medication for almost a decade with little improvement. After the procedure, which only focused on her left hand, her tremor there has almost disappeared.\n\n“This has changed the quality of my life,” she said. “Now, it’s a pleasure, I can sign my name, I can write. I can eat like a normal person, doing things that I couldn’t do before.”\n\nSharon Samuels performs an Archimedes spiral drawing test before and after her treatment for essential tremor in her left hand. Suzanna Masih and Hyacinth Empinado/STAT\n\nIn July, the Food and Drug Administration approved the device being used in the trial. It has been developed by InSightec, which is funding the trial along with the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation.\n\nA pilot study on MRI-guided focused ultrasound treatment was published in 2013.\n\nThe randomized trial provides further data on the treatment. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, 76 patients were treated with focused ultrasound, and their tremor was evaluated after the first, third, sixth, and 12th month. Researchers found that the severity of essential tremor reduced significantly over that time in the patients who underwent the treatment versus those who had a sham procedure. The treated group also evaluated their quality of life as much better than before the procedure, despite a few persistent side effects like gait disturbance and paresthesia — the sensation of prickling pins and needles.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for The Readout Your daily guide to what’s happening in biotech. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nNeurologist Dr. Bryan Ho, who is not involved in the trial, noted that tremor suppression remained sustained throughout the 12 months. But he expressed concern about the side effects of the treatment.\n\n“Over a third of patients actually experienced either gait disturbance or paresthesia. It’s a pretty high incidence of side effects,” said Dr. Ho, who is the director of the Movement Disorders Program at Tufts Medical Center.\n\nHe added that since these patients were only followed for a year, there isn’t enough data available yet to determine the long-term efficacy of the treatment.\n\n“It’s one and done,” he said. “Patients may have some benefit for a period of time, but how do they do five years from now or 10 years from now after the treatment? That needs to be shown.”\n\nThe researchers are in the process of collecting this data; the clinical trial will run until December. The doctors at Brigham will follow up with Samuels — and others who undergo the treatment — for up to five years and run more MRI scans and neurological exams to find out for how long the lesion lasts and keeps the tremor suppressed.\n\nFor now, the treatment has had an immense impact on patients’ lives. “These people are able to go back and now use that hand like you and I use our hands, without thinking about it,” said Dr. Cosgrove.\n\n“They can write their names again, they can feed themselves, they are not embarrassed about being in public. So it really is extraordinarily helpful for people.”""]",It’s hard to think about the potential negative consequences of this treatment after watching a woman’s remarkable recovery in the accompanying video.,"This story describes a recently FDA-approved device to treat essential tremor in patients who have not responded to medication. The ExAblate Neuro, made by Dallas-based InSightec, uses magnetic resonance images taken during the procedure to deliver focused ultrasound that destroys tissue in the thalamus, the part of the brain where tremors are believed to originate.
Results of a randomized clinical trial on the device’s safety and efficacy were published this month in the New England Journal of Medicine. The story and accompanying video (seen at right) vividly illustrate rapid symptom improvements, highlighting a 72-year-old woman who says the procedure changed her life by allowing her to “eat like a normal person” and easily perform basic tasks such as signing her name and folding a scarf.
This powerful patient anecdote throws the balance off: Imagine how different the story would seem if the video instead showed a patient who had improved, but also was affected by one of the serious adverse effects caused by the treatment.
Also, the story needed specific numbers on the measured benefits and harms, along with a discussion of costs and alternative treatment options.
Note: We also reviewed the news release that was issued to journalists about this study.

The low-cost approach, grounded in psychological theories of pain, could help address the nation\'s epidemic of addictions to opioid painkillers and illicit drugs.\n\nVeterans who received this pain-focused care while also being treated for addiction found that the intensity of their pain decreased, their ability to function increased, and their alcohol use went down, compared to veterans who received a less-focused approach. However, the two groups had similar rates of drug use.\n\nJust 10 weekly sessions of the approach, called ImPAT for Improving Pain during Addiction Treatment, had an effect that lasted up to a year in 55 veterans who took part, according to the new results published in the journal Addiction by a team from the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System\'s Center for Clinical Management Research and University of Michigan Medical School\'s Addiction Center.\n\nThe researchers have already launched a follow-up study in a larger group of 480 non-veterans in a residential addiction treatment program. And the study\'s authors note that the ImPAT approach has the potential to be easily and inexpensively adopted by addiction treatment centers and groups worldwide, through team members trained in standard psychological techniques.\n\nCaught in the middle\n\n""These results highlight the need for addiction treatment programs to offer a multifaceted approach that doesn\'t only address substance use but also the other factors that might be driving substance use, including pain,"" says Mark Ilgen, Ph.D., the study\'s lead author and a VA and U-M psychologist specializing in addiction research. ""We\'ve shown that it\'s possible to improve pain outcomes in people with addiction, and even have some spillover effects on their substance use.""\n\nAddiction treatment programs often have patients who suffer from chronic pain, but offer few options to treat them, Ilgen says.\n\nTo make matters worse, ""Past studies of psychosocial approaches for pain have often excluded people with drug or alcohol problems, addiction treatment programs do not usually have providers trained in pain care, and many pain specialists will not treat people who also have addiction. So patients are caught in the middle.""\n\nAll 129 patients in the study, most of them men in their 40s and 50s, were receiving outpatient addiction treatment in a CBT-based, non-abstinence setting at the Ann Arbor VA. Half were randomly assigned to ImPAT sessions, the other half to support groups of peers, led by a therapist, where pain and addiction could be discussed.\n\nCombination approach\n\nImPAT combines elements of cognitive behavioral therapy with another psychosocial approach called acceptance and commitment therapy.\n\nWhile the two approaches aren\'t usually used together, they are often used in pain treatment settings - but those clinics and programs don\'t often accept people who also acknowledge they have addiction issues. Ilgen and his colleagues hope their results will help bring the techniques into addiction treatment settings, where the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is often used.\n\nThe ImPAT technique seeks to use integrated approaches both to help patients focus less on their pain and more on other aspects of life. This includes techniques to help people adapt to their pain, find ways to distract themselves from their pain, and think of ways to function in the face of pain.\n\n""We want to take the focus off pain and put it onto functioning, and finding pleasurable ways to spend time,"" Ilgen says. ""There\'s also a strong link between depression and pain. Pain is responsive to mood, and mood is responsive to social support.""\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the new paper, another addiction and pain specialist, William C. Becker, Ph.D. of Yale University and the Connecticut VA, notes that the new results are even more impressive because ImPAT was compared with another psychosocial approach.\n\nThe newly published study did show that one in five veterans randomly assigned to ImPAT or the comparison approach did not actually attend any sessions - likely because of delays in getting the sessions going. The larger ongoing study, based in an abstinence-based treatment facility in Michigan and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has largely avoided that issue by decreasing the delay between study recruitment and the start of the treatment groups, Ilgen says.\n\nThe study in veterans was planned just before the rapid rise in, and increased awareness of, opioid painkiller addiction issues in the U.S. While opioid addiction was one of the issues faced by veterans in the study, most had issues with multiple substances.\n\nThe sharp rise in opioid addiction in recent years - often among people who started taking the painkillers as treatment for acute or chronic pain -- has made the search for effective non-drug pain treatment options even more urgent, Ilgen notes.\n\n""Long-term use of opioids can sometimes lead to a hypersensitivity to pain, so there may actually be a causal link between use of these medications and pain,"" he notes. ""We need to study psychological pain management approaches in opioid-dependent patients, including those receiving addiction therapies such as buprenorphine.""\n\nIn the meantime, he notes, people struggling with addiction who want to seek relief from pain should explore the full range of treatment options that have been shown to work in non-addicted patients, including physical therapy, exercise and psychotherapy as well as antidepressant medications. And while existing prescription guidelines do not explicitly prohibit the use of opioid painkillers in people with pain who have substance use disorders, these guidelines recommend only using opioids sparingly and under close supervision, he says.\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Ilgen, an associate professor in the U-M Department of Psychiatry and member of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, the study team included Addiction Center director Frederic Blow, Ph.D., as well as Amy S. B. Bohnert, Ph.D., Stephen Chermack, Ph.D., Carly Conran, Mary Jannausch, M.S., and Jodie Trafton. Blow, Bohnert and Chermack are all members of the VA CCMR and IHPI. The study was funded by the Veterans Health Administration\'s Health Services Research and Development Service\n\nReference: Addiction, Volume 111, Issue 8, pages 1385-1393, August 2016. doi:10.1111/add.13349, http://onlinelibrary. wiley. com/ doi/ 10. 1111/ add. 13349/ abstract']",This release on non-drug methods to help treat pain in people with addiction could have better explained the scope of benefit — how much and in what percentage of those studied.,"The release focuses on a recently published journal article that reported patients with chronic pain who are fighting drug addiction can reduce their pain using an approach called Improving Pain during Addiction Treatment (ImPAT).
The release notes that the intensity of pain decreased, alcohol use decreased, and ability to function increased, for patients participating in ImPAT when compared to patients who participated only in conventional support groups. Rates of drug use were approximately the same for both groups.
While the release does a good job of explaining why non-drug therapies are important for patients with chronic pain and a history of addiction, it does not meet our standard for telling readers the scope of benefit of ImPAT therapy as measured in the study — what degree of benefit in what percentage of those studied.

REUTERS/Neil Hall\n\nThe findings may be applicable to other countries, too, according to senior author Dr. Susan R. Davis from Monash University in Melbourne.\n\n“From my interactions with colleagues from across the globe, I do not believe that what we have observed is Australian-specific,” she told Reuters Health by email. “The management of menopause has been relatively similar in the UK, the USA and in Australia.”\n\nUp to half of women in menopause experience so-called vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which generally combines estrogen plus progestin, is very effective. But after the initial findings of the Women’s Health Initiative study showed that HRT can increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke and other serious problems, many women stopped using it.\n\nAs reported in the journal Menopause, in 2013 and 2014 Davis and her team analyzed survey responses from nearly 1,500 women ages 40 to 65.\n\nSeventeen percent were having moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, and 18 percent reported moderate to severe sexual symptoms.\n\nBut most were not receiving any kind of treatment. Only 11 percent reported use of HRT, and less than 1 percent were using any type of therapy that didn’t involve hormones.\n\nThe women who did use hormones were mostly taking pills containing estrogen, rather than preparations that are absorbed into the skin and that are potentially safer, the researchers found.\n\n“Extrapolating our findings to 3.7 million Australian women aged 40 to 64 years, we found that 455,000 women are likely to have moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, with most women (385,000) remaining untreated,” they write.\n\nIn addition, very few women were receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for sexual symptoms. Vaginal dryness is common with menopause and affects sexual functioning. Vaginal estrogen preparations are very safe and effective for this problem but were prescribed to less than 5 percent of the women, the authors say.\n\nWhy are so few women being treated?\n\n“Overall, there is the uncertainty of women and of doctors as to what the options are, what is and is not safe, and of the safe options - what and how to prescribe them,” Davis said.\n\nThere is also, she said, a complete lack of understanding that for most women, these symptoms are not fleeting.\n\n“It isn’t ‘grin and bear it for a few months’ and it will all pass, as many women suffer severe symptoms for five-plus years,” she said. “Women and doctors simply are not aware that symptoms can last this long.”\n\nFinally, many women don’t realize that non hormonal options can be safe and effective, she added.\n\nDr. Wulf H. Utian, medical director of the North American Menopause Society, agrees that many reasons may underlie the lack of treatment. “It is partly ‘fall out’ from the controversy over hormone therapy,” he told Reuters Health in an email.\n\nBut overall, he said, it is a combination of patients not wanting therapy or not having information about it, and also the provider not prescribing it.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1hOWOoq Menopause, online July 31, 2015.""]","This story doesn’t provide evidence to back up claims that certain therapies mentioned in the story are safe and effective. It also seems to push for treatment, without adequately exploring why some women may decide against it.","This story highlights a survey finding that appears to have broadly useful implications for millions of women across the globe: “Many women with severe menopausal symptoms are not being treated for them even though safe, effective remedies are available.” But there’s a tension at the heart of this story that unfortunately is never resolved and which limits the impact of the article. One of the reasons the women mentioned in the story aren’t being treated is because they know that hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the traditional treatment for menopausal symptoms, “can increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke and other serious problems,” as the story acknowledges. The story then suggests that there are alternative approaches, including topical vaginal estrogen therapy and nonhormonal treatments, that are both “safe and effective” and which apparently should be used more often. But the story never backs up the claim that these remedies work and are safe — information that is key to convincing the reader that the story’s claims are true and can be trusted. The story also misses the opportunity to explore how women may feel about menopause and whether some women’s reluctance to be treated reflects a legitimate, informed choice. The assumption seems to be that treatment is clearly the correct choice, but many decline it because they are misinformed. We don’t think that framing reflects the reality of the situation.

Quality of life was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire and head and neck module.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures Laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival.\n\nResults Of the 424 patients included in the trial, 168 treated patients with cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx were included in this analysis (90 in the CRT group and 78 in the radiotherapy alone group). The median (range) age of the patients was 59 (40-80) years in the CRT group and 61 (35-81) years in the radiotherapy alone group. In the CRT group, 72 patients (80.0%) were male and 18 (20.0%) were female. In the radiotherapy alone group, 62 (79.5%) were male and 16 (20.5%) were female. The rates of laryngeal preservation at 2 years were 87.9% for CRT vs 85.7% for radiotherapy alone, with an HR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.23-1.42; P = .22). Similarly, the HR for laryngectomy-free survival comparing CRT vs radiotherapy alone was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.11; P = .17). This study was not powered to assess organ preservation. Median overall survival was 27 (95% CI, 20-45) vs 21 (95% CI, 17-35) months for the CRT and radiotherapy alone groups, respectively, with an HR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.60-1.27). No differences between treatments were reported regarding overall quality of life, need for a feeding tube, or speech.\n\nConclusions and Relevance The results of a possible cetuximab-related laryngeal preservation benefit for patients with hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer are intriguing; these results need to be interpreted in the context of a retrospective subset analysis with limited sample size.\n\nTrial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00004227\n\nIntroduction\n\nHistorically, locoregionally advanced squamous cell cancers of the larynx or hypopharynx have been treated with surgical resection, usually involving laryngectomy with or without postoperative radiotherapy.1 Although laryngectomy is an effective treatment, investigators have sought therapeutic strategies that result in voice preservation. Various modifications of surgical techniques have been explored.2-5 Alternatively, in the early 1980s, investigators evaluated curative primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery as an option for these patients.6,7 Retrospective studies8,9 that compared primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery to initial surgery with postoperative radiotherapy found similar rates of survival in patients with advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers.\n\nAfter the realization that many patients could avoid total laryngectomy with the use of primary radiotherapy, several combination chemoradiotherapy strategies were introduced for patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers. In large phase 3 randomized clinical trials, induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy demonstrated equivalent overall survival compared with surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy in patients with laryngeal10,11 and hypopharyngeal cancers.12 More recently, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 91-11 trial revealed that radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin resulted in a superior laryngeal preservation rate compared with induction with cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for these advanced laryngeal cancers.13,14 However, this treatment did not produce a survival benefit.\n\nThe appropriate use of surgery or radiotherapy-based approaches for organ preservation has been the subject of much debate.15-18 Unfortunately, there has been a lack of improvement in overall survival for patients with laryngeal carcinoma in large database studies19-21 examining the last 30 years of care. Investigators have reported that poor follow-up may contribute to the potential for larger and less curable recurrences, and surgeons experienced with radiotherapy with salvage surgery need to be involved as early as possible.20,21\n\nThe analysis described in this report was performed to assess the laryngeal preservation rates of patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers who were entered into a randomized clinical trial of cetuximab and radiotherapy (CRT) compared with radiotherapy alone.22,23 This group of patients represents a subgroup (168 patients) of a larger population (424 patients) that also included patients with oropharyngeal cancers. It is noteworthy that this randomized clinical trial was not designed to enroll a sufficient number of patients to definitively and prospectively address the subject of the analysis reported herein. Previous reports22,23 of the overall randomized clinical trial found locoregional control and survival advantages associated with the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy.\n\nMethods\n\nPatients\n\nPatients were enrolled in the multicenter, open-label, stratified, randomized, phase 3 study from April 1, 1999, through March 31, 2002, from 73 centers in the United States and 14 other countries. Patients who entered the trial had stage III or IV nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx (Figure 1 and Table 1). Patients were eligible if they had pathologically confirmed stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma, had measurable disease, had no distant metastases, had no prior therapy for the tumor under study, and were medically suitable to undergo definitive radiotherapy. This subgroup includes the patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers. The protocol was approved by the ethics review boards at the participating institutions, and all the patients provided written informed consent.\n\nPatients were initially evaluated with a comprehensive head and neck examination, which included panendoscopy. The primary tumors and lymph nodes were staged by the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging classification of 1998. Initial evaluation included computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region and chest radiography. Patients began treatment within 2 weeks after this initial evaluation, as determined by the randomization procedure.22 Patients who underwent no surgery or less extensive operations were censored at death or date of last contact.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe primary radiotherapy was delivered with curative intent. Investigators selected 1 of 3 radiation fractionation regimens: once daily, twice daily, or concomitant boost regimen (Figure 1). Cervical lymph node drainage regions, considered to be at high risk for subclinical disease, were treated with a dose of 50 to 54 Gy. The primary tumor and gross nodal disease received full-dose radiotherapy (70-76.8 Gy, depending on fractionation). However, if a postoperative neck dissection was planned, gross nodal disease could be treated with 60 Gy.\n\nFor patients randomized to CRT, cetuximab treatment consisted of an initial dose of 400 mg/m2 and was delivered as a 120-minute intravenous infusion. This initial dose was delivered 1 week before the initiation of CRT. Patients received weekly cetuximab infusions during the radiotherapy treatment. Seven weekly infusions were delivered at a dose of 250 mg/m2 for a period of 60 minutes each.\n\nFor patients who were scheduled to have a planned neck dissection, surgery was scheduled to take place 4 to 8 weeks after completion of CRT or radiotherapy alone.\n\nEvaluations\n\nEvaluations, including physical examination, hematologic testing, and chemical profiles, were performed weekly for the duration of the study. A pharmacologic profile was also performed weekly on patients receiving cetuximab infusion (CRT group). Patients provided a history and underwent a physical examination, which included a fiberoptic examination of the tumor, as well as an assessment of all study end points at required time points after the completion of treatment.22 Posttreatment assessments were performed 4 and 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Patients who were scheduled for a planned postoperative neck dissection could have their 8-week assessment at the 6-week time point, along with posttreatment computed tomography. Subsequently, patients were evaluated every 4 months during the first and second years. They were evaluated semiannually during years 3 to 5. These follow-up assessments included imaging studies, consisting of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nThe instruments used in this study were the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 version 3.0 and the Quality of Life Head and Neck Module 35. The self-administered core questionnaire consisted of 30 questions and incorporated 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, and a global health and quality-of-life scale. The remaining single items assessed additional symptoms commonly reported by patients with cancer, as well as the perceived financial effect of disease and treatment. All scales and single items met the standards for reliability. The 35-item module comprised 1 multi-item scale and a series of single items assessing head and neck–associated symptoms and adverse effects from conventional therapy.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nThe randomization was not stratified by primary site of cancer; hence, the results presented below are a retrospective analysis of the selected subset of patients. A CONSORT flow diagram was included with the original publication of the trial.23 A trial profile for the analysis presented here is shown in Figure 1. The primary end point of the study was to examine differences in the rate of locoregional disease control maintained for 1 year. The duration of locoregional control was defined as the absence of locoregional disease progression at the scheduled follow-up visits and was determined through a masked review of the investigator-generated data by an independent committee of experts. The duration of locoregional control was from randomization to the first documented progression or recurrence of locoregional disease or death from any cause. Overall survival was calculated from randomization to death from any cause. Tumor present in a neck dissection, which was performed for any reason after 15 weeks after radiotherapy, constituted locoregional progression. Distribution of time-to-event parameters was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and treatment effects were compared using a log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the nonstratified hazard ratio (HR). The Kaplan-Meier method was also used to estimate the rate of preservation of larynx.24 Patients who underwent no surgery or lesser operations were censored at death or date of last contact.\n\nResults\n\nCharacteristics of the Patients\n\nA total of 424 patients participated in the study and 168 were included in the subanalysis (90 in the CRT group or 78 in the radiotherapy alone group). Most patients from both treatment groups were treated with the concomitant boost fractionation regimen. The 2 treatment groups were well balanced with respect to sex, tumor stage, node stage (Table 1), and the rate of neck surgery (16% in the CRT group and 14% in the radiotherapy alone group).\n\nTreatment Adherence\n\nThe median durations of treatment were 52, 46, and 43 days for once daily, twice daily, or concomitant boost, respectively, for patients treated with CRT and 52, 44, and 43 days, respectively, for patients treated with radiotherapy alone. For patients who received cetuximab, the median number of cetuximab infusions was 8 (range, 1–11). The median cumulative cetuximab dose was 2154 mg/m2 (range, 14-2887 mg/m2). The number of patients who received 7 or more cetuximab infusions was 80 (88.9%). The radiotherapy quality assurance review found that the mean and median doses for the once daily, twice daily, and concomitant boost regimens were 68.7 and 70.0 Gy, 74.3 and 74.4 Gy, and 70.8 and 72.0 Gy, respectively; these doses were similar in both treatment groups. Radiotherapy adherence for patients who received CRT or radiotherapy alone was balanced; 65 (72.2%) received CRT and 56 (71.8%) received radiotherapy alone as planned or with minor deviation. A total of 121 patients (72%) were treated as planned or with minor deviation. Major acceptable deviations in the CRT and radiotherapy alone groups were found in 13 (14.4%) and 13 (16.7%) patients, and major unacceptable deviations were observed in 3 (3.3%) and 5 (6.4%) patients, respectively. A total of 9 (10.0%) and 4 (5.1%) patients in these respective groups were not evaluable for a radiation quality assurance review. The differences in radiotherapy adherence between the 2 treatment groups were not statistically significant. Neck dissections were performed in 14 patients (15.6%) treated with CRT and 11 patients (14.1%) treated with radiotherapy alone.\n\nEfficacy\n\nLocoregional control was the primary end point of the phase 3 study. For this subgroup of patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, locoregional control was slightly improved for patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56-1.13) (Table 2). The 2-year rates of locoregional control were 36.9% in the CRT group and 25.7% in the radiotherapy alone group. Survival was also slightly improved for patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.60-1.27) (Table 2). The 3-year survival rates were 41.9% in the CRT group and 39.0% in the radiotherapy alone group.\n\nThe rates of laryngeal preservation (no need for salvage laryngectomy) were 87.9% at 2 and 3 years in the CRT group compared with 85.7% at 2 years and 76.8% at 3 years in the radiotherapy alone group. The 2.2% and 11.1% absolute improvements in the rates of laryngeal preservation, at 2 and 3 years, respectively, favored CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (Figure 2). However, this improvement was not statistically significant (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.23-1.42; P = .22). In addition, there was a 4.0% and 8.9% absolute improvement in laryngectomy-free survival at 2 and 3 years, respectively. Again, these differences did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.54-1.11; P = .17) (Figure 2).\n\nSafety\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse events are given in Table 3. The frequency of grades 3 and 4 mucositis/stomatitis and odynophagia was not significantly different among patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone. Patients who received CRT had a greater rate of acneiform rash compared with patients who received radiotherapy alone (Table 3). Chills, fever, and headache were the only toxic events reported to occur at any grade with significantly higher frequency (P = .002, P = .01, and P = .004, respectively) in patients in the CRT group than in the radiotherapy alone group; however, their incidences were low (chills, 16 [17.8%] vs 2 [2.6%]; fever, 20 [22.2%] vs 6 [7.7%]; headache, 20 [22.2%] vs 5 [6.4%]).\n\nQuality of Life\n\nThe quality-of-life responses were evaluated in a longitudinal design in all patients. Baseline assessment was performed at or just after randomization. Subsequent assessments took place before the beginning of the fourth week of radiotherapy, at the 8-week posttreatment evaluation, and at the 2 every-4-month follow-up evaluations of year 1. Plots of mean changes in global health status, use of a feeding tube, or speech problems reveal no differences between the treatment groups (Figure 3). A positive value in change indicates an improvement for the patient.\n\nDifferences in mean changes in swallowing at radiotherapy week 4 (−15 in the CRT group and −25 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .02), loss of appetite at radiotherapy week 4 (−11 in the CRT group and −18 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .03), nausea at week 8 after radiotherapy (−7.3 in the CRT group and 0.3 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04), coughing at radiotherapy week 4 (7.4 in the CRT group and −5.6 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .02) and at week 8 after radiotherapy (−3.2 in the CRT group and 1.1 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04), constipation at month 8 (2.6 in the CRT group and −19 in the radiotherapy alone group, P < .001), and cognitive functioning at month 12 (−7.0 in the CRT group and 4.6 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04) were not seen at the other time points.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWhen laryngectomy is the primary treatment for locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, patients gradually adjust to the loss of natural phonation, but the condition substantially interferes with normal communication and social interactions.25 In addition, although the effect of the procedure on voice frequently receives the greatest consideration, the presence of the stoma may also adversely affect patients’ quality of life.26\n\nIn the analysis reported herein, laryngeal preservation rates were studied in a subgroup of patients who were part of a large phase 3 trial that compared primary radiotherapy with or without the antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab. The use of CRT produced a higher rate of laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone for patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers. Although the difference in the rates of laryngeal preservation between the 2 groups did not reach statistical significance, the initial trial was not powered to assess this subgroup question. The HR of 0.57 is a strong indicator that cetuximab, when added to radiotherapy, may improve laryngeal preservation. The 87.9% rate of laryngeal preservation at 2 years for CRT found in this trial is similar to the rate reported for the use of radiotherapy and concomitant cisplatin in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 91-11 trial (n = 547).13\n\nPatients who undergo a laryngectomy often experience a difficult adjustment process. Even when the patient achieves a certain level of comfort with various techniques of artificial speech,27 the ability to communicate with others is hampered.26,28,29 Investigations have explored both the patient’s and the interviewer’s perceptions of the patient’s difficulty with communication after laryngectomy.26 Of interest, the interviewers perceived the patients’ impairment with communication as a much greater infringement on quality of life compared with the patients’ perceptions. Patients who underwent laryngectomy believed that interference with social activities resulted in a greater detrimental effect regarding their quality of life compared with the interviewers’ perception of this factor. Therefore, patients have their own perceptions, as well as the perceptions of others, as potential hurdles to normal activities after laryngectomy.\n\nThe perception of life without a larynx plays an important role in a patient’s treatment decision. In a recent trial from France, 269 patients were queried about the treatment choices they might make if they faced the diagnosis of advanced laryngeal cancer.30 Only 29% stated that they would not consider options with a lower chance of cure if told that the best option, with respect to survival, was total laryngectomy. However, their enthusiasm for seeking laryngeal-preserving options waned when told about potential adverse effects, such as tracheostomy or permanent gastrostomy. An older report31 of interviews with firefighters and executives who were asked to envision that they had advanced laryngeal cancer determined that they were willing to accept a 15% to 30% reduction in life expectancy for a laryngeal-preserving treatment compared with total laryngectomy. These studies30,31 demonstrate the importance of reviewing options and potential adverse effects with patients before making a decision regarding the best treatment.\n\nConsidering the importance of laryngeal function, many head and neck cancer treatments have been directed toward the goal of laryngeal preservation. One of the largest randomized clinical trials was designed to evaluate laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone, concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.13,14 Each treatment group included at least 180 patients, thus providing much greater statistical power than the current communication. The use of concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.46. However, the induction regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil did not improve laryngeal preservation over radiotherapy alone. Neither concomitant chemoradiotherapy nor induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy resulted in improved overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone. Furthermore, there were greater severe acute toxic effects from the chemoradiotherapy treatments compared with radiotherapy alone,13 but no significant differences in severe late toxic effects were noted in the comparison of the 3 treatment arms.14 Unfortunately, the concomitant chemoradiotherapy arm had an increase in deaths not attributable to cancer compared with the other 2 arms; this finding needs to be explored further to determine whether undetected fatal late treatment toxic effects are greater with concomitant regimens.\n\nAlthough induction chemotherapy was not used in this trial, it has been the subject of many past and recent assessments involving laryngeal preservation, as well as other efficacy and safety outcomes.10-14 A retrospective review32 of the phase 3 TAX 324 trial (Induction Chemotherapy Comparing Taxotere Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil With Standard Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil Followed by Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer) in patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers revealed that induction chemotherapy of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (n = 90) compared with cisplatin plus fluorouracil (n = 76) followed by chemoradiotherapy with weekly carboplatin resulted in significantly improved overall survival (P = .02) and progression-free survival (P = .03) for the docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil group. Among patients undergoing surgery, laryngectomy-free survival was also significantly greater with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (P = .03).\n\nThe TREMPLIN (Radiotherapy With Cisplatin Versus Radiotherapy With Cetuximab After Induction Chemotherapy for Larynx Preservation) trial compared the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy using docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, followed by chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (n = 60) or cetuximab (n = 56), for laryngeal preservation.33 No differences were found in laryngeal preservation, laryngeal function preservation, or overall survival between the 2 regimens. Newer studies, such as DeCIDE (Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy Plus or Minus IC to Decrease Events in Head and Neck Cancer)34 and PARADIGM (Combination Chemotherapy and Radiation in Treating Patients With Stage III or IV Head and Neck Cancer),35 suggest no overall benefit from the addition of induction chemotherapy vs concomitant chemoradiotherapy alone.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe higher rate of laryngeal preservation that was achieved with the use of CRT compared with radiotherapy alone was encouraging. Furthermore, no significant increases in the most debilitating radiotherapy-induced toxic effects, such as mucositis/stomatitis and dysphagia, were observed. This treatment approach warrants further evaluation in larger populations to fully assess the potential value of cetuximab or other molecular targeting agents to augment laryngeal preservation rates.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: April 9, 2016.\n\nPublished Online: July 7, 2016. doi:10.1001/jamaoto.2016.1228\n\nCorrection: This article was corrected on October 26, 2018, to correct an inaccurate conflict of interest disclosure; it was previously corrected on December 15, 2016, to correct errors in number at risk in Figure 2A.\n\nCorresponding Author: James A.

Was the news release warranted?,"Illustration: National Cancer Institute
The release focuses on a recent article published in JAMA Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery about a treatment for cancer of the larnyx. The paper reports that use of the drug cetuximab in conjunction with radiation therapy results in modestly-improved survival rates for patients with cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx who have not had their larynx surgically removed. The release does a good job of explaining the nature of the research involved, namely that these findings stem from a retrospective analysis of a relatively small subgroup who participated in a larger study. The release also stresses that the use of cetuximab in conjunction with radiation therapy for requires further evaluation. That is all to the good. However, while the release provides specific numbers in regard to potential benefits, it never makes clear that these numbers, in this study design, are statistically nonsignificant. In other words, statistically speaking, there is no advantage. In addition, the release does not do enough to address issues related to cost and potential harms — nor does it place the work in context with previous research on the use of cetuximab and radiation therapy in treating head and neck cancers.

In actuality, about one in four adults of that age now take statins, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe guidelines, issued by two leading cardiology societies in November 2013, move away from trying to lower cholesterol to particular target levels. Instead, patients are urged to consider statins if they have an overall risk of 7.5 percent of developing a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years. The risk can be calculated using an online tool that considers such factors as gender, age, race, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and smoking status.\n\nThe guidelines were contested almost as soon as they were announced. Critics said that the online calculator greatly overstated a patient’s risk of developing a heart problem and that new guidelines would lead millions of additional people to take statins, exposing them to potential side effects such as muscle pain or damage with little to gain.\n\nThat debate continues with the release of the new studies.\n\n“These two articles indicate that the new guidelines allow you to treat more people and provide better results at a reasonable cost,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale, who was not involved in the studies.\n\nBut some say the studies have too many shortcomings to be persuasive.\n\n“I don’t think they are terribly informative and I don’t think they change our thinking,” said Dr. Steven E.

This story focuses on two new studies that address these issues (see here and here). It brings clarity where much of the competing coverage — including a competing piece by NBC — tended to focus on the idea that greater statin use would be a net win for people. While it did a great job overall, the Times piece leaves us with a few lingering questions that we discuss below in the review.

The NYU Langone researchers believe that obesity may contribute to the risk for development of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis through fat tissue-driven systemic inflammation.\n\n""Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are chronic inflammatory conditions that can be quite uncomfortable and often painful for patients, so any treatment that might reduce symptoms may improve quality of life,"" says lead study author Soumya Reddy, MD, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of rheumatology at NYU Langone, and co-director of NYU Langone\'s Psoriatic Arthritis Center. ""Our new study shows that those who shed excess weight could see significant symptomatic relief.""\n\nThe researchers say excess weight loss may reduce the body-wide inflammation and pain triggered by extreme excesses of fat tissue. They plan to present their findings on Sunday Nov. 8, 2015 at the 2015 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting in San Francisco.\n\nFor the study, Reddy and colleagues reviewed the medical charts of 9,073 weight-loss surgery patients who were treated between 2002 and 2013 at NYU Langone\'s Weight Management Program. They identified 86 patients who had psoriasis before their operation, 21 of whom were also diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, and compared their symptoms before and after undergoing bariatric surgery. The research team compared their patients\' symptoms from before and after undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients were on average monitored for more than six years, with an average excess weight loss of 46.2 percent body weight.\n\nThe researchers found 55 percent of patients with psoriasis and 62 percent of patients with psoriatic arthritis reported improvements in their disease.\n\nPatients who underwent surgery saw significant reductions in their disease severity scores at post-surgical follow-up -- according to a 0 to 10 rating scale -- with disease severity scores in patients with psoriasis dropping from 5.6 to 4.4, and scores falling from 6.4 to 4.5 for those with psoriatic arthritis.\n\nResults were even more pronounced in those with severe disease activity, with scores falling from 7.7 before surgery to 5.7 after for patients with severe psoriasis, and from 8.2 to 4.8 after surgery for patients with severe psoriatic arthritis.\n\nFurther analysis showed those who lost the most excess weight a year after surgery showed the biggest improvements in their disease activity.

This news release comes from a poster presented at a national meeting, which has not yet undergone peer review. Many key elements were not well described or sufficiently highlighted.  The fact that this research comes from observational data (chart review) is important since we cannot infer causation from this type of research, and it is possible that some other factor stemming from the surgery besides the weight loss (for example, changes in diet or absorption of key nutrients) was responsible for the remission in psoriasis symptoms, rather than the weight loss itself.

This is why most doctors recommend ‘active surveillance’ for low-risk cancers,” he said.\n\nThree-year survival from prostate cancer was excellent in the study at over 99 percent for patients regardless of whether they chose surgery, radiation or active surveillance. Barocas did caution that prostate cancer tends to be slow growing and patients would need to be followed for 10 years or more to find differences in mortality.\n\n“This study shows that, despite technological advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, both surgery and radiation still have a negative effect on quality of life,” said co-author David Penson, M.D., MPH, Paul V. Hamilton, M.D., and Virginia E. Howd Professor of Urologic Oncology and professor and chair of the Department of Urologic Surgery.\n\n“Certainly, if a man has low-risk prostate cancer, he should seriously be considering active surveillance as a reasonable way to go,” he said.\n\nErectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence were more common in men treated with surgery than radiation when studied three years after treatment, although the difference in sexual dysfunction was only apparent in patients with excellent baseline function.\n\n“Urinary incontinence was reported as a moderate or big problem in 14 percent of men three years after surgery compared to 5 percent of men who had radiation,” Barocas said.\n\n“Men who had radiation reported more problems with bowel function and hormone side effects compared to men who had surgery, but these differences were only seen within the first year following treatment,” he said.\n\nThe authors also reported that:\n\n- Surgery was associated with fewer urinary irritative symptoms, like weak urine stream or urinary frequency, compared to active surveillance.\n\n- Radiation patients had similar urinary irritative symptoms to men on active surveillance, which is an improvement from previous studies with older radiation techniques.\n\n- None of the treatments had an impact on general quality of life, such as the ability to do activities of daily living, emotional health and energy or vitality.\n\nFunding for the study was provided by grants 1R01HS019356 and 1R01HS022640 from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; UL1TR000011 to the Vanderbilt Institute of Clinical and Translational Research from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; and 5T32CA106183 from the National Institute of Health and the National Cancer Institute (Dr Tyson). Research reported in this article was partially funded through a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) award CE12-11-4667.']","Since reduced harms from active surveillance is an important topic, we wish the release had provided numbers and context.","A Vanderbilt University news release about an important study on prostate cancer treatments and quality of life left us disappointed: Why so few specifics on the measured benefits?
In this 3-year study of more than 2,500 men with prostate cancer, researchers compared how these patients rated their quality of life after treatment by surgery, radiation or active surveillance.
The study found that patients who chose active surveillance reported fewer side effects, but the release disappoints with a lack of numbers and precision.

It was 85 percent accurate in detecting these cancers in more than 300 patients, the new study found.\n\nEach year, 1.4 million cases of cancer of the stomach and esophagus (the tube leading from the throat to the stomach) are diagnosed worldwide. Both tend to be diagnosed at a late stage and the five-year survival rate for the two cancers is 15 percent, the researchers said.\n\nFindings from the study were presented Monday at the European Cancer Congress (ECC).\n\n""At present the only way to diagnose esophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy. This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications,"" study author Dr. Sheraz Markar said in an ECC news release. Markar is from Imperial College London in England.\n\nWith endoscopy, a flexible tube is threaded down a sedated patient\'s throat to the stomach to view the digestive tract.\n\n""A breath test could be used as a noninvasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival,"" Markar said.\n\n""Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the esophagus and stomach, and which do not,"" he explained.\n\nMarkar added that the test needs to be validated in a bigger group before it could be used on patients.

This short news story focuses on an experimental diagnostic test that researchers hope can be used to detect stomach and esophageal cancers. The test would work by measuring chemicals found in a patient’s breath that suggest the presence of a cancer.
The story wisely notes that the findings are preliminary and that more work needs to be done before the test can be used on patients outside of clinical trials. We applaud the story for taking a cautious approach to the research.
On the other hand, the story leans heavily on a news release (which we also reviewed) and includes no independent perspective on the research. The story also could have been made stronger by including information on cost, the study design behind the findings, and how the research fits into the broader suite of research on using breath to diagnose cancer in general and stomach cancer in particular.
As we also noted in our review of the news release, we think the story spent too much time speculating on the benefits of this test, when the research just doesn’t support those speculations.

Longo tested the impact of fasting for five consecutive days every month, believing that when the body thinks it\'s in a state of fasting, it shuts down and goes into standby mode.\n\n""As cells are killed and the body goes into standby, your stem cells switch on,"" says Longo. Once switched on, the stem cells can regenerate the lost cells and organ mass -- leaving you shiny and new.\n\nWhen cells in the body age, their ratios change and Longo believes the body\'s reaction -- and repair methods -- to fasting help restore them to when you were younger. ""You\'re killing the bad cells and regenerating with cells that are more functional.""\n\nStarvation strategies\n\nIn a 2015 study , Longo\'s team set a specific diet for human volunteers, which mimicked the effects of fasting over five consecutive days monthly, for three months. Trials were also conducted in mice.\n\nPeople consumed approximately 1000 calories on day one and 725 calories for the remaining four days, but these numbers alone didn\'t determine the benefit.\n\n""It\'s not just about reducing calories"", says Longo. His diet is designed to include specific percentages of protein, fat and carbohydrates, for maximum effect. The food items used, however, were specific to the trial and if translated to the public would involve designing meals made up of the right combination of nutrients.\n\n""The human fasting mimicking diet (FMD) program is a plant based diet program designed to attain fasting-like effects while providing micronutrient nourishment (vitamins, minerals, etc.) and minimize the burden of fasting,"" Longo said in the study\n\nAfter three months, the benefits were a reduction in body weight as well as certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was also an increase in certain stem cells in the body.\n\n""The diet is turning on the body\'s ability to renew itself,"" says Longo.\n\nThe team have since calculated that following the diet every three months could provide enough of an impact as effects are thought to last up to six months.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n""When you fast, you lower protein and certain amino acids and you control pathways [in the body],"" says Longo. The pathways he refers to are known as TOR, PKA and IGF pathways, which when controlled can switch on certain reactions inside the body causing immune cells to die and organs to shrink.\n\nThis activation, or reduction, of pathways is why the components of the diet, such a proteins, must also be controlled. ""You won\'t activate the correct pathways,"" says Longo.\n\n""When you make IGF less active, it reduces risk factors linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease,"" says Miguel Toribio-Mateas, Chairman of the British Association for Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy.\n\nAccording to Toribio-Mateas, the results confirm earlier theories that ""some hormone-like growth factors that are required during development to grow, then become promoting agents of aging after development and sexual maturity have been reached"". He also believes the benefits are down to improved efficiency on a cellular level.\n\n""Cells have a list of things to do every day,...like getting rid of toxins"" says Toribio-Mateas. If their workload is then disrupted by the need to store excess calories, certain products can accumulate. ""Regulating calories can have a very positive effect,"" he says. To him, diet underpins longevity.\n\nIs it safe?\n\nUnlike the 5-2 diet, which requires two days of low calories at any point in the week, Longo\'s diet involves fasting for five consecutive days, which requires much more willpower.\n\n""Five days is safe: going on for longer is difficult to do outside of a clinic,"" says Longo.\n\nMore work needs to be done to fine tune the diet and determine meals that meet the criteria. Longo has since founded his own nutrition company. L-Nutra, to sell products that serve this purpose, which may be seen as a conflict of interest. He states that profits are going back into funding further research by his team.\n\n""The results of the study are encouraging and warrant more research in this area,"" says Toribio-Mateas.']",This story about a pilot study on health benefits of fasting jumps to big conclusions about its potential to extend life span. We urge readers to be cautious with this one.,"This CNN story looks at studies investigating the potential life-extending benefits of periodically fasting, and of consuming a special diet that makes the body think it’s fasting. It glosses over important details like who was studied and how, and instead claims that the diet has the potential to “help you live longer.” That’s an unhelpful, clickbait-y approach to the science that we wish more news outlets would avoid. Extensive passages devoted to medical jargon only serve to confuse the reader, as well.

The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure.\n\nKnees, stretching and heel-striking: three running myths debunked Read more\n\nPartial replacements, also known as unicompartmental replacements, are suitable for people who have arthritis in just one side of the knee, usually the inner. They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.\n\n\n\nResearchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be.\n\nThe main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis. About half of all patients should be suitable for a partial replacement, but an analysis of data routinely collected by the National Joint Registry showed that of 98,147 knee replacements undertaken in 2016, only 9% were partial.\n\n“The main strength of this study is that we were able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their GP visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible,” said Dr Rafael Pinedo-Villanueva, the co-lead researcher and NDORMS senior health economist, who is funded by the National Institute of Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre and the Medical Research Council.\n\n“This has allowed us to provide strong proof that partial knee replacements are both better for patients and cheaper for the NHS.”\n\nWhether people had a partial or total replacement varied by surgeon, as did the success of the operation, the researchers discovered. Those surgeons who carried out more partial replacements had better outcomes from them than surgeons who did fewer.\n\n“This is an important finding,” said co-lead researcher Prof David Murray. “If surgeons aim to use partial knees in a quarter or more of their knee replacements this will substantially improve the results of knee replacement and will save money. In addition, more partial knee replacements will be done and more patients will benefit from this procedure.”\n\nEd Burn, first author of the paper, said they needed to get surgeons on board. “For patients and the NHS to see the benefits of partial replacements, we need the buy-in of surgeons, who would need to feel comfortable performing a greater proportion of their knee replacements as partials,” he said.\n\n“If we see surgeons carrying out this procedure more often, the proportion of knee replacements that are partials would increase from the current figure of 9% and we would see an increase in future economic and population health gains.”']","With no independent reporting, the story glosses over how the study was conducted, what was measured, and what the limitations were.","This story parrots a news release sent out by Oxford University about a study published in the journal BMJ Open. The study concludes that partial knee replacements would — in many cases — leave patients “better off” than total knee replacements.
With no independent reporting, the story glosses over how the study was conducted, what was measured, and what the limitations were. It also didn’t discuss harms of surgery, among other problems. An over-reliance on publicity materials appears to be a pattern — last week the Guardian received a 1-star score from us for a different story that also simply restated what the news release said.

These VOCs produce a unique smell print for each individual and specific patterns are seen in people with asthma.\n\nThe new study included 27 people with intermittent or mild persistent asthma and 24 healthy people. None of the study volunteers had a history of smoking. Those with asthma had a history of allergies, and none had been treated with corticosteroids for at least four weeks prior to the start of the study.\n\nCurrently, asthma is diagnosed ""based on your medical history and symptoms, and with spirometry (lung function testing) and exhaled nitric oxide,"" said Dr. Thomas Leath, director of allergy and immunology at Scott & White Healthcare in Round Rock, Texas.\n\nThe Italian researchers wanted to compare the electronic nose to the other commonly used tests -- spirometry and FENO -- to see which test was best at confirming a diagnosis of asthma.\n\nTo do this, all of the study volunteers were given all three tests. Each test is non-invasive, requiring only the use of exhaled air.\n\nThe electronic nose was able to correctly differentiate healthy people from those with physician-diagnosed asthma in 87.5 percent of the cases. FENO was able to correctly identify asthma in 79.2 percent of the study volunteers and lung function testing (spirometry) discerned just 70.8 percent of the people with asthma.\n\nWhen the electronic nose and FENO were combined, the two tests together correctly identified almost 96 percent of the asthma cases.\n\n""This is potentially a great tool. It could be used for screening if it\'s affordable or for seeing the effect of anti-inflammatory medicines. But, it definitely needs more research,"" said Leath.\n\nTwo other asthma experts agreed.\n\n""This device is interesting and warrants a further look, but it still needs to be perfected and the researchers need to figure out its niche,"" said Dr. Jennifer Appleyard, chief of allergy and immunology at St. John Hospital and Medical Center in Detroit. ""We need to know if it\'s good for diagnostics or for measuring improvements after treatment. In some diseases, you use blood markers to monitor treatment response. Could you use this to see if patients are responding? We also need to know if it\'s good for diagnosing all types of asthma.""\n\nDr. David Rosenstreich, director of the division of allergy and immunology at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, added: ""An objective and fast test for diagnosing asthma would be helpful, and this test seems to be a non-invasive way of sampling for the underlying problem. This test seems relatively easy for patients and it does have potential, but they\'ve only looked at a very narrow collection of people who have allergic asthma.""\n\nBoth Appleyard and Leath noted that cost might initially limit the use of an electronic nose.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about how asthma is currently diagnosed from the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.']",This story about an experimental technique for diagnosing asthma was refreshingly light on hype and included quite a few caveats and qualifiers.,"The new test looks for volatile organic compounds that are presumably uniquely exhaled by people with asthma. When used in combination with a somewhat standard test, the new process may provide somewhat greater ability to diagnose asthma. The story rightly notes the study was conducted in a small number of subjects and is far from definitive.

In the eight-week trial, researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and other blood markers.\n\n“Curcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,” said the study’s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar.\n\n“Two key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,” said Sahebkar researcher at the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, in an email.\n\nThese properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies, he noted, but there have been relatively few studies in people. So his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short-term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease.\n\nHaving a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome. People with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both.\n\nInflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar’s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. They set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling 117 participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study.\n\nHalf were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder, and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside. All the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks.\n\nAt the beginning of the study and again at the end, the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk.\n\nThey found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels. The comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers, and no changes in the other markers.\n\nThe study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of CRP concentrations in a total of 281 patients.\n\n“The findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,” Sahebkar said.\n\nThe researchers didn’t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it’s not clear what the long-term implications may be they caution in their report.\n\nThe study was funded by the Clinical Trial Research Center in Tehran and the Iran National Science Foundation. One of the authors is CEO of Sabinsa Corporation and Sami Labs Ltd, manufacturers of curcumin supplements.\n\nSahebkar said most of the clinical benefits reported for curcumin have been achieved when curcumin was added to a standard drug therapy regimen, and patients should be careful not to replace their prescribed drugs with curcumin without prior consultation with their physician.\n\n“Curcumin is a very safe natural supplement, and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use, even at high doses,” Sahebkar said.\n\nHowever, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said.\n\n“In addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,” Sahebkar said.\n\nSahebkar added that he is often asked about the possibility of using turmeric instead of pure curcumin supplements.\n\n“Whilst turmeric is known to have several medicinal properties, and its regular use in diet is strongly suggested, it cannot be regarded as an equivalent substitution of curcumin,” he said.\n\nSahebkar said turmeric contains very low quantities of curcumin, usually less than 5 percent, and curcumin has a very low absorption in its raw form, usually less than one percent of raw curcumin is absorbed when taken orally.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1sWsZ9y Clinical Nutrition, online January 7, 2015.']","When one of the researchers on a study is the CEO of two companies that manufacture the supplement being tested, it’s especially important for stories to include some independent vetting of the results in their coverage. This story didn’t include that outside perspective.","This story is about a study claiming that an organic compound called curcumin, most commonly found in small doses in the spice turmeric, appears to reduce inflammation, one of the many risk factors for diseases such as heart disease. The story does a pretty solid job of explaining what happened in the study and its limitations. However, readers would benefit from a better explanation of just how much the curcumin regimen reduced inflammation and what that specifically means for reducing the risks of heart disease.

It shows that women who had surgery survived longer than those who didn\'t: a median of 28 months vs. 19 months. When the researchers examined a small subset of the group — those who survived 10 years — they found that 9.6 percent had chosen to have surgery while 2.9 percent had not.\n\n""Maybe we need to revisit this question of surgery,"" said Mary C. Schroeder, an assistant professor in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Iowa and one of the authors of the study. ""It may not be right for all women, but it may be better for some women than it was in 1995.""\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrevious research has reached the same conclusion, but a significant problem with this study and others like it is that they rely on retrospective data, looking back over any number of years, said Michael S. Sabel, the chief of surgical oncology at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the newly published study. In retrospective research, it\'s impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said.\n\n""It\'s premature to suggest, and it’s a difficult conversation to have with patients, that removing the breast will help them live longer in the face of Stage 4 disease,"" Sabel said.\n\nTwo small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don\'t, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a Stage 4 case, cancer cells have left the breast, metastizing to bones or other organs, which presents a more dire and immediate threat to a woman\'s survival than the presence of the original tumor. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. Some evidence suggests that it may be influencing the woman\'s immunological response to her cancer. Or it could be continuously ""seeding"" the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.\n\nIn their study, Schroeder; Alexandra Thomas, a professor at Iowa\'s Carver College of Medicine, and others looked at 21,372 women from 1988 to 2011 who had Stage 4 breast cancer at the time of their original diagnosis and did not receive radiation as part of their first course of therapy. Their median age was 63.\n\nThe researchers found that median survival for all of the women improved from 20 to 26 months as more sophisticated treatments and better imaging techniques developed over that time. As other research has shown, African American women were over-represented among women who have Stage 4 breast cancer at the time they are first diagnosed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn interviews, Schroeder and Thomas stressed that each decision about whether to have surgery is based on many factors that only a woman and her doctors can assess, in particular how far the cancer has spread and how sick she is.\n\nBut with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.\n\n""Aggressive local therapy may benefit select women, such as those with an already established potential for durable remission,"" they wrote in their paper. That would include younger women whose cancers have not spread in great volume to other organs and who have certain kinds of cancers that respond better to drugs, Lisa Newman, medical director of the Henry Ford Health System\'s International Center for the Study of Breast Cancer Subtypes, said in an e-mail. Newman was not involved in the study.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n""Theoretically...patients with metastatic breast cancer might benefit from surgery to remove the cancerous breast tumor in combination with medical therapies as a more complete reduction of their total body cancer burden,"" she added.\n\nRead more:\n\nFor more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.\n\nAD']",A large retrospective study suggests surgery could help stage 4 breast cancer patients survive longer. The Post evaluates this claim thoroughly.,"This story is about a large retrospective study that was published this week in the journal JAMA Surgery. The research suggests women who opted for surgery to treat their breast cancer had better survival rates than those who didn’t, even though the number of surgeries has plunged from 1988 to 2011.
This Washington Post report does many things well: It quantifies the benefits of breast surgery in absolute terms, points out the study’s limitations and doesn’t make sweeping recommendations based on this research. Furthermore, the story uses cautionary language, making readers really question whether surgery is the better option for stage 4 breast cancer patients. It also incorporates two independent sources who provide some critical perspectives, such as the two other small studies that showed no correlation between surgery and survival in this group of women.
We would have liked to have seen more discussion on the harms of breast surgeries, as well as the existing therapies for breast cancer patients. And we would have liked for the report to have pointed out that usually younger women underwent surgery in the study, which may have affected the results.
Overall, however, the Washington Post puts forth a thorough, nuanced story based on the latest findings.

The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. But one of the biggest obstacles in understanding CTE has been the inability to diagnose it in the living. New research released Tuesday may make that possible. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease.\n\n""This is something new,"" said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist and senior author of the studyMcKee has performed many of the high profile diagnoses of CTE among former pro-football players and is director of the Boston University CTE Center.\n\nAn early step in the right direction\n\nMcKee also cautioned that this is still early research. ""The next step -- is repeating, validating our findings, and seeing if we can detect it in blood, and of course doing it in living subjects. These are critical next steps,"" she said.\n\nCTE causes Alzheimer\'s-like symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, aggression, rage and, at times, suicidal behavior. It is believed to result from repeated trauma to the head, which causes a buildup of the abnormal protein tau which clumps in the brain.\n\nIn this new study, researchers found an increased amount of the protein CCL11 in patients previously diagnosed with CTE. CCL11 is a protein commonly associated with inflammation, a process which McKee said can be a trigger for the disease. ""Inflammation is normally a very helpful response in the brain, but when it goes on and persists for a long time, and gets out of control -- that\'s what we think happens in CTE,"" said McKee.\n\nMore exposure to football increases likeliness of CCL11\n\nThe paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzheimer\'s disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer\'s, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. However, contrary to the popularly held belief that a greater number of concussions are linked to CTE , no connection was found between levels of CCL11 and reported number of concussions. In addition, the number of reported concussions tend to be an unreliable indicator in general, because they are usually self reported.\n\nAlthough there are different stages of the disease that indicate how far it has progressed, this study was unable to determine any connections between levels of CCL11 and severity of CTE.\n\n""The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. Once we can successfully diagnose CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it,"" said McKee.\n\n""It is a good step forward but I will be very conservative about the interpretations of the possible application to diagnosis,"" said Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist credited with making the first diagnosis of CTE among professional football players. Omalu found traces of the disease in the brain of legendary Pittsburgh Steelers player and pro Hall of Famer Mike Webster in 2002.\n\nWhile Omalu was cautiously optimistic about the development, he also noted that CCL11 isn\'t unique to the brain disease. ""This is an inflammatory marker that may be non-specific and may not be diagnostic of CTE,"" he said.\n\nWhile it is hoped that this will be one avenue to help detect the disease in the living, McKee believes that it will just be one part of a larger process. ""This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE,"" said McKee.\n\nimaging. Previous studies have evaluated other potential biomarkers for CTE, including identifying the protein tau using brainimaging.\n\n110 of 111 former NFL players found with CTE\n\nA recent analysis by BU found evidence of CTE in 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players. However, there is a potential bias in that study, as relatives of these players may have submitted their brains for diagnosis due to clinical symptoms noticed while the players were alive.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nCTE has been detected in veterans, as well as players of other contact sports; however, it has become most associated with football. Along with Hernandez, CTE has been diagnosed in San Diego Charger and Hall of Famer Junior Seau, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles\' Kevin Turner and the Oakland Raiders\' Ken Stabler, to name a few.\n\nIn 2015, a federal judge approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of concussions and repeated head trauma. The agreement provides up to $5 million per retired player for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma.']","Many news outlets covered this research, which could leave readers with the impression the finding is closer to clinical use than it really is.","The story focuses on a recent journal article that reported finding higher levels of the protein CCL11 in individuals who were posthumously diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) than was found in healthy individuals or in those who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed after an individual has died, and this finding is presented as a first step toward developing a diagnostic tool for CTE that can be used while patients are still alive.
This is a very preliminary basic science research study and probably not worth publicizing to a general audience. As the story explains, no one really knows how relevant this finding is yet, and if it will lead to anything clinicians can use. The story at least makes that very clear, and tapped an independent source to provide context.

And breast cancer stage was only analyzed in women who actually developed cancer.\n\nOn the other hand, among roughly 170,000 women screened between 1994 and 2006 and followed for a decade, more than half who received annual mammograms were called back at least once because of a false-positive result, and 7 to 9 percent were recommended to get a biopsy.\n\nFewer women -- about 42 percent -- who had biennial screening were called back because of a false-positive, while 4.8 percent were referred for a biopsy.\n\nHaving a previous mammogram for comparison purposes sliced the rate of false-positives in half.\n\nFor the study, researchers used data from NCI\'s Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.\n\nWomen undergoing once-yearly mammograms need to be prepared for possible call backs, and being prepared may reduce the anxiety around such an event, the authors stated.\n\nThis is the latest volley in an ongoing debate about when to start mammography screening in women.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), a government-sponsored organization, startled the world by recommending that women start mammograms at age 50 instead of 40 and then only once every two years rather than once a year.\n\nThe move released an outcry in the medical community, leading to this and other studies to try to determine the best timing for mammograms, the only screening tool shown to reduce deaths from breast cancer.\n\nThe new study gives a nod in the direction of the UPSTF recommendations, but practitioners aren\'t necessarily ready to let go of the long-standing once-a-year recommendation.\n\nHubbard, an assistant investigator with Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, Wash., said she ""definitely wouldn\'t make a specific recommendation for individual women. I feel it\'s really an individual choice where a woman needs to think about her own risk tolerance and also their own breast cancer risk.""\n\n""This gives women more information as to what the risks and benefits of mammography are,"" added Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""It\'s a personal choice as to whether or not you absolutely have to screen at 40. As breast surgeons, we\'re still going to advocate that mammograms start at 40.""\n\nA second study in the same journal issue looked at more than 800,000 U.S. women screened from 2000 to 2006 and found that newer digital mammography and older film mammography were similarly accurate in finding cancer in women ages 50 through 79.\n\nBut in premenopausal women in their 40s, who tend to have denser breast tissue, digital mammography performed better. Again, though, the risk of false-positives was higher than with film mammography.\n\n""There was a trade-off here as well,"" said Hubbard, who was also an author of this study. ""In general, in women aged 50 to 79 the two modalities performed pretty equivalently, but in younger women the sensitivity of digital mammography was a little bit better so it found more cancers, but there was also a bigger decrease in specificity [resulting in more false-positives].""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on mammography.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">We were troubled by the way this story was framed. </span>", ,3,real

New research suggests consuming broccoli could also slow or reverse blood-vessel damage and atherosclerosis due to high cholesterol.\n\nThe study, in Experimental Biology and Medicine, found that a high-cholesterol diet combined with supplements containing sulforaphane, a natural compound in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, significantly reduced levels of LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, in rabbits, compared with a high-fat diet without the supplements. Sulforaphane-fed rabbits also had higher levels of good cholesterol and improved blood-vessel function.\n\nPrevious studies showed that sulforaphane can reduce inflammation in cultured vascular cells, but its effects on atherosclerosis hadn’t been studied directly, the researchers said. Sulforaphane has an “extraordinary” ability to trigger multiple enzymes that protect against oxidative or environmental stress and reduce inflammation, they suggest. The study, at Mansoura University in Egypt, involved three groups of five rabbits. Two of the groups were fed a high-cholesterol diet for four weeks, including one group that also received daily supplements of sulforaphane orally in a sodium solution. A control group got a normal diet without sulforaphane. Treatment with sulforaphane decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL by 43%, 70% and 40%, respectively, compared with untreated rabbits on a high-cholesterol diet. Sulforaphane treatment also enhanced levels of HDL, the so-called good cholesterol, above normal, according to the study. The cholesterol ratio, an indication of heart-disease risk, was close to control levels in sulforaphane-treated animals, the study said. After four weeks, CRP, or C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammation, significantly decreased in suforaphane-treated rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet compared with rabbits on the same diet that didn’t get the supplement. CRP levels in sulforaphane-treated rabbits were almost at control levels. Blood vessels from rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet were atrophied and inflamed. There was mild vessel swelling in sulforaphane-treated rabbits, while control rabbits had normal vessels. Caveat: Sulforaphane hasn’t been tested on people with high cholesterol.

It’s a miniature telescope implanted directly into the eye that magnifies images to more than twice their size.\n\nFindings from the clinical trials show that the telescope does improve vision for the majority of patients. Still, there are some concerns about corneal damage, since the telescope is relatively large inside the eye. And the population who might benefit from the new device is somewhat limited. The treatment doesn\'t work for those who have had cataract surgery. And for those who catch the disease early on, there may be better options.\n\nBut for 80-year-old Marian Orr, the implanted telescope was just what she needed. Orr has a big family: five children, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. That means lots of graduations, weddings and school events. In other words, lots to see. So when Orr\'s vision began to decline in her mid 70s, she got worried. Both her father and uncle went blind in their 60s, and she knew macular degeneration was often inherited.\n\nOrr says her sight gradually diminished. It got to the point ""where I couldn\'t see. If I looked at you straight on, I couldn\'t see your face, could only see your head,"" she says. ""I couldn\'t see the eyes and the nose. I could just see the round head that was all, sort of like a halo was all over it.""\n\nThis blurred vision is pretty typical of macular degeneration.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jessica Daitch Jessica Daitch\n\nOrr couldn\'t see things in a store. Her daughter took her grocery shopping. Orr couldn\'t identify pots, pans and dishes in her kitchen. And the outdoors became an unfamiliar, startling place.\n\nTesting The Tiny Telescope\n\nSo when Orr\'s cousin read about an experimental treatment for macular degeneration, Orr quickly got in touch with one of the researchers, had some basic tests, and before she knew it, she was one of more than 200 patients to have an experimental miniature telescope implanted in her eye.\n\nDr. Kathryn A. Colby, ophthalmic surgeon at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, calls the pea-sized technology a true ""breakthrough"" that could help millions of patients who, until now, have had no treatment options. Colby was one of the principal investigators in the clinical trials of the miniature telescopes. They were conducted at 28 leading ophthalmic centers and included 219 patients with end-stage, age-related macular degeneration. She was not Orr\'s doctor.\n\nWhat happens with age-related macular degeneration is that the center of the retina deteriorates, and people gradually lose sight. Colby says if you think of the eye as an old-style camera with film, then the retina is the film. Over years of wear and tear, it degenerates and weakens and no longer transmits full images to the brain. That\'s why Orr saw blank spots where people\'s noses and eyes should be in their faces, sort of like ""holes in the film,"" says Colby.\n\nColby says that by magnifying the image, the telescope allows the part of the vision that\'s missing to become smaller. And so the ""blanks"" in the image appear to fill up, presenting the individual with a nearly complete image.\n\nBut, like all telescopes, when vision is narrowly focused, the peripheral view gets lost. This is why the telescope is implanted in only one eye. The other eye is used for peripheral vision.\n\nColby says that\'s also why patients need to learn to use the implanted telescope eye for near activities. For example, if they\'re looking to see what time it is on a clock, they use the eye with the implanted telescope. But if they\'re scanning the room to see exactly where the clock is, they use the other eye, which also has end-stage macular degeneration.\n\nAfter surgery, patients do a variety of eye exercises to train their eyes to work together. It wasn\'t hard for Orr, who was used to wearing contacts, one for distance and one for close-up. For her, the tiny new eye telescope has put the ""bustle"" back into her life.\n\n""I\'m very active in my church. And I am a lunch buddy at one of the schools nearby,"" she says. Orr has lunch every week with the children in the first and second grades. She reads a lot, even books with regular-sized print, which her daughter gives her. She can read the newspaper and watch TV. ""I\'m busy,"" she says. ""That\'s for sure!""\n\nEarly Findings\n\nPractically all the patients in the telescope study with Orr had their vision improve. And 75 percent of them, like Orr, had major improvement. But because the telescope is relatively large, patients risk damage to the cornea. In the study, 10 out of 219 patients had corneal problems. Five required a corneal transplant. As a result, the Food and Drug Administration plans to monitor safety for at least five years for the next set of patients who receive the telescope.\n\nDespite its terrific potential, the new eye telescope isn\'t for everyone. Dr. George Williams is an ophthalmologist and retinal surgeon associated with the American Academy of Ophthalmology. He sees lots of patients who might qualify for the eye telescope.\n\nBut he also sees a lot of patients who cannot be candidates. For one, the treatment doesn\'t work for those who have had cataract surgery.\n\n""In order to implant this device, we need to remove the natural lens, or the cataract, and then use a portion of the natural lens to position and support the telescope,"" says Williams.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies\n\nCataract surgery removes the natural lens and, in most cases, replaces it with an artificial lens, which means there is no foundation for the telescope.\n\nAnd for patients who are in the early stages of macular degeneration, Williams says that medications approved just six years ago are effective and a lot less invasive than the telescope. The drugs are injected directly into the eye on a monthly basis. And with this treatment, doctors are able to prevent severe visual loss in over 90 percent of patients. In nearly half of all patients, visual improvement is significant.\n\nSo the take-home message: If you\'re over 60 and you begin to experience visual loss, get yourself to an eye specialist as soon as possible to see if you can be treated with medication to stabilize and even reverse the vision loss you\'ve experienced. If that happens, Williams says, then patients may never get to the point where they need a telescope in their eye.']","A near model story for how to report on surgical developments, this piece only had a few missing elements and earns a five-star rating.  ","The story starts with a gee whiz hook but then gives readers the necessary context.

Brooke of the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nDoctors who did not perform the surgery won’t have that context, which may explain part of the survival benefit of returning to the original hospital, he said.\n\nHe and his team analyzed Medicare claims data from 2001 to 2011 on patients readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after major surgeries, including coronary artery bypass surgery, removal of the colon or pancreas, and hip or knee replacement. More than nine million patients underwent one of 12 such surgeries during the study period, and between six and 22 percent, depending on the surgery, were readmitted to the hospital within a month.\n\nMore than half the time, patients were readmitted or transferred to the hospital where they had the surgery.\n\nThose who returned to the original hospital were 26 percent less likely to die within three months of surgery than those admitted to a different hospital, as reported in The Lancet.\n\n“Patients readmitted after surgery almost always have a postoperative complication, either medical or surgical,” Drs.

She is also president of HealthStat Consulting Inc. in Seattle.\n\nThe new study, like previous ones, re-ignites the ongoing debate about the best age to start routine mammograms and the best screening interval. It appears in the March issue of the journal Radiology.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued mammogram recommendations. It recommends women aged 50 to 74 who are at average risk for breast cancer have a mammogram done every two years. It also suggests that women aged 40 to 49 at average risk discuss the pros and cons with their doctors and decide on an individual basis if and when to start screening.\n\nMeanwhile, other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, recommend women begin mammograms at age 40 and continue to have them annually.\n\nMalmgren and her colleagues evaluated nearly 2,000 women who had breast cancer. All were aged 40 to 49 when they were treated between 1990 and 2008.\n\nThe researchers looked at the method of diagnosis, whether by mammogram or if the cancer was found by the doctor or the woman. They also took these into account: the cancer\'s stage at diagnosis; type of treatment; annual follow-up; recurrence; and survival.\n\nOver the 18-year period, the number of breast cancers diagnosed at very early stages increased 66 percent, while the number of more advanced cancers (stage 3) decreased by 66 percent.\n\nThose whose cancers were detected by mammogram rose from 28 percent in 1990 to 58 percent in 2008. The number of cancers detected by doctor or patients declined from 73 percent in 1990 to 42 percent in 2008.\n\nWomen whose cancers were detected by mammograms were more likely than the doctor- or patient-detected cancers to have lumpectomy or other breast-conserving surgery: 67 percent vs. 48 percent. The women whose cancers were detected by mammograms were less likely to be given chemotherapy.\n\nWhile 4 percent of women whose cancer was found on mammogram died during a follow-up period that ranged from one to 20 years, 11 percent of those whose cancers were found by the doctor or the women died.\n\nWhen the researchers looked only at invasive cancers, 92 percent of the women whose cancer was found on mammogram survived without recurrence at five years; 88 percent of the other group did.\n\n""I don\'t think the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is looking at the whole picture,"" Malmgren said. ""They are concentrating on the harms.""\n\nAmong them, according to the 2009 guidelines, are false-positives, which can lead to anxiety and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nMalmgren, a breast cancer survivor, says more focus should be placed on the benefit of early diagnosis, because it often means less treatment is needed.\n\nThere was a decrease found in cancers being diagnosed at later stages in those whose cancers were found on mammograms. ""That\'s where the money is,"" Malmgren said.\n\nDr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, reviewed the study. ""The findings make sense,"" she said.\n\nThey found that cancers can be detected earlier by mammogram. ""A screening test, if it can\'t find something earlier than [by] clinical presentation, is a poor test,"" she said.\n\nHowever, she said, the study does not provide support for all women aged 40 to 49 to have routine mammograms.\n\nWhen considering its recommendation, the task force took all available evidence into account, including published studies, Moyer noted. ""The data from randomized trials and modeling show there is a very modest improvement in mortality with mammograms from 40 to 49,"" she said.\n\n""Because it is so modest and there are risks, people need to make their own decision,"" Moyer said.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about mammograms, go to the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']","It’s interesting to note that many leading news organizations chose not to write about this new study.  Did this story do anything to clarify the decision-making process for women in their 40s? Oh, well, better than ","Although the article presents some interesting new findings regarding mammogram for women in their 40s, the article lacks a strong critical analysis to point out the weaknesses with the current study.

For years, they didn\'t. Then his luck ran out.\n\n""My reaction was, \'Well, you smoked for 30 years. You got away with it for another 30 years and this is it.\' I thought it was a death sentence,"" he says.\n\nPollner, who lives in Monroe, N.Y., was 76 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Like many patients his age, he didn\'t expect there would be any effective treatment. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women. And it is mainly a disease of older people. Only about 2 percent of lung cancer patients are under 45 and the average age at diagnosis is about 70.\n\nOlder patients are frequently not offered curative treatment like surgery, because they and their families and even their doctors often think they won\'t be able to tolerate it. So they are referred for supportive care to control symptoms, rather than surgery to remove the cancer.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael Rubenstein for NPR Michael Rubenstein for NPR\n\nBut many patients can survive and even thrive after surgery, says Dr. Prasad Adusumilli, a thoracic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was senior author of a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in October. The study looked at more than 2,000 patients with Stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer who had surgery to remove their tumor. About 70 percent of the patients were 65 years old or older and about 30 percent were at least 75.\n\nAnd he found that a surprising number of these older patients did quite well. One year after surgery, more people had died from other causes than died from lung cancer. And, after five years, almost 9 out of 10 patients were alive and cancer free.\n\n""They did well and beat their lung cancer,"" Adusumilli says, proving that when it comes to surgery for early stage lung cancer, age should not be a limiting factor.\n\nThis was the case for Morton Pollner, who is one of Adusumilli\'s patients. His cancer had not spread, and Adusumilli told him there was a good possibility the cancerous tissue could be completely removed and he could go back to leading a normal life. That was seven years ago. Today, Pollner is 82, cancer free and enjoying life.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael Rubenstein for NPR Michael Rubenstein for NPR\n\n""Whatever I get from here on, it\'s like gravy,"" he says.\n\nSurgery isn\'t the answer for all older lung cancer patients, according to Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Patients with heart or other health problems may not be candidates. At the same time, he says it\'s important to recognize that patterns of aging have changed over the past two decades.\n\nSeventy today is not the same as it was 20 years ago, Lichtenfeld says. Older adults are more functional, both physically and mentally, than ever before, and he says the medical community needs to adjust its thinking about what treatments older cancer patients can tolerate.\n\n""We shouldn\'t allow numerical age to be the deciding factor,"" Lichtenfeld says.']",Unfortunately the story relies more on patient anecdotes than evidence.,"According to this story from NPR, new study findings apparently challenge the conventional wisdom that surgery to remove lung cancer is too hard to bear for older adults.
The story overstates the findings, however, by saying patients “can benefit.” The study was observational only; it was a “competing risks analysis” to gather and assess data about the outcomes of surgery for early lung cancer.
The researchers’ chief conclusion was “In patients who undergo curative-intent resection of stage I NSCLC [non-small cell lung cancer], noncancer-specific mortality is a significant competing event, with an increasing impact as patient age increases.” In plain language, many older lung cancer patients die of non-cancer problems. Somehow NPR translated that to “Older Patients Can Benefit From Lung Cancer Surgery.” An optimistic and potentially true statement, but certainly not in line with the researchers’ more conservative conclusion as written in the journal where the findings were published. Unfortunately the NPR story relies more on anecdote rather than evidence, and didn’t push back enough on what this study can and can’t tell us.

1477,story_reviews_00588,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/effectiveness-of-breast-cancer-screening/,2015-07-06 04:00:00,Here's new evidence that widespread breast cancer screening isn't effective,"['If mass mammography screening for breast cancer worked well, fewer women would die from the disease.\n\nAnd yet, a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine has found something that may seem counterintuitive: More breast cancer screening didn\'t actually save lives. Screening did however lead to more ""overdiagnosis,"" detecting cancers that would not have been fatal or even harmful.\n\nThe research, led by Richard Wilson of Harvard University, revealed that in more than 500 US counties, mammography screening programs were linked with more diagnoses of smaller breast cancers — but not with fewer deaths or with fewer larger breast cancers (which theoretically would be prevented by finding the disease early through screening).\n\nYou can see this clearly in the chart below: The number of diagnosed breast cancers rose with more screening, yet the number of deaths from breast cancer 10 years later remained stubbornly stable.\n\nTo be clear: Mass screening is different from using technologies like ultrasounds to diagnose people at risk of a disease or who have symptoms that require investigation. And not all mass screening programs are bad. Colorectal cancer screening, for example, has been shown to save lives as a result of early detection, and the Pap test transformed cervical cancer into a treatable disease.\n\nBut this isn\'t the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis.\n\n\n\nThe trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn\'t have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will.\n\nWe have to find a better way to screen women for breast cancer\n\nThe medical community has known about overdiagnosis and overtreatment for years, documenting the problem in a range of cancers — in breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid (which you can see in the chart above).\n\nThis raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? In a related commentary in the journal, a pair of doctors from the University of Washington School of Medicine note that the estimates of overdiagnosis of breast cancer are ""frustratingly broad"" — from less than 10 percent to 50 percent or more of women who get screened. In other words, we don\'t actually know how bad the problem is.\n\n""Sadly,"" they write, ""we are left in a conundrum. Women will increasingly approach their physicians with questions and concerns about overdiagnosis, and we have no clear answers to provide.""\n\n\n\nThe authors of the newest study don\'t advocate no screening. Instead, they note that the benefits of screening will probably be more favorable when screening is directed at people with a high risk of the disease — such as those with a family history of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force, which analyzes the best available evidence to create guidelines for doctors, now recommends biennial mammography screening for the general population in women ages 50 to 74. For women under 50 and over 75 — who aren\'t at a high risk of breast cancer — the benefits of mass screening are less clear.\n\nThere are small things doctors can do that still don\'t happen often enough. For example, most women aren\'t told about the potential downsides of mammography screening — even though they\'re almost always briefed on the benefits.\n\nFor now, it\'s up to patients to talk to their doctors about their particular risk profiles and how to screen accordingly. We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.\n\nWATCH: The naked mole rat might help us cure cancer']",A capable summary of a study suggesting that increased breast cancer screening doesn’t reduce mortality rates. There were a couple of deficiencies in the coverage.,"This story reports on a new study looking at breast cancer screening rates across hundreds of counties in the United States. It found that while higher breast cancer screening rates were associated with increased rates of breast cancer detection, more screening was not associated with reduced breast cancer mortality. The explanation for this finding, according to both the study and the story, is that higher levels of screening lead to overdiagnosis of breast cancer — that is, finding small. early-stage breast cancers that probably would never need treatment.
The story overall is solid and notably features some very helpful visuals — including a figure from the study that demonstrates the main study outcomes (click on the image for a closer look), as well as a risk communication tool that outlines the benefits and harms of mammography. But the story fell short when it came to discussing the many limitations of this study design and their possible impact on the results. Those limitations were discussed in the study itself, or perhaps would have come to light through inclusion of an additional expert perspective.

No one breathes in perfect rhythm all day. We hold our breath when we're concentrating. We take in more air when we exercise. Irregular breathing in the form of frequent sighing and yawning, though, brings in more air and can contribute to hyperventilation.

The two big drawbacks on the piece are the lack of hard numbers (instead of percentages) to explain the purported benefits of the treatment and the lack of any discussion of the risks of using this treatment versus better known alternatives.

Coronary arterial calcification, or CAC, is considered a very early sign of cardiovascular disease. Importantly, the presence of breast arterial calcification also appears to be an equivalent or stronger risk factor for CAC than other well-established cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. Earlier research had shown a link between breast arterial calcification and atherosclerotic disease--even heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular disease events, but researchers said these data provide a more direct relationship between the extent of calcified plaque in the mammary and coronary arteries, as well as a comparison to standard risk evaluation.\n\n""Many women, especially young women, don\'t know the health of their coronary arteries. Based on our data, if a mammogram shows breast arterial calcifications it can be a red flag--an \'aha\' moment--that there is a strong possibility she also has plaque in her coronary arteries,"" said Harvey Hecht, M.D., professor at the Icahn School of Medicine and director of cardiovascular imaging at Mount Sinai St. Luke\'s hospital, and lead author of the study.\n\nAll told, 70 percent of the women who had evidence of breast arterial calcification on their mammogram were also found to have CAC as shown on a noncontrast CT scan of the chest. For women under 60 years of age with CAC, half also had breast arterial calcification--an important finding as very few would be thinking about or considered for early signs of heart disease. There were even fewer false positives among younger patients; researchers said that if a younger woman had breast arterial calcification, there was an 83 percent chance she also had CAC.\n\nNotably, breast arterial calcification also appeared to be as strong a predictor for cardiovascular risk as standard risk scores such as the Framingham Risk Score, which underestimates women\'s risk, and the 2013 Cholesterol Guidelines Pooled Cohort Equations, which tends to overestimate risk, Hecht said. When researchers added 33 asymptomatic women with established CAD, breast arterial calcification was more powerful than both risk assessment formulas, which suggests the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis may be a more important indicator of heart disease than other risk factors.\n\n""This information is available on every mammogram, with no additional cost or radiation exposure, and our research suggests breast arterial calcification is as good as the standard risk factor-based estimate for predicting risk,"" Hecht said. ""Using this information would allow at-risk women to be referred for standard CAC scoring and to be able to start focusing on prevention--perhaps even taking a statin when it can make the most difference.""\n\nMultivariate analysis showed that early signs of a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries were most strongly related to breast arterial calcification. While CAC was about two times as likely with advancing age or high blood pressure, it was three times more likely with breast arterial calcification.\n\n""The message is if a woman is getting a mammogram, look for breast arterial calcification. It\'s a freebie and provides critical information that could be lifesaving for some women,"" Hecht said, adding he hopes these findings will prompt clinicians, who rarely report breast arterial calcification, to routinely report not just the presence or absence of breast arterial calcifications but also to estimate and note the amount.\n\n""The more breast arterial calcification a women has, the more likely she is to have calcium in her heart\'s arteries as well. If all it requires is to take a closer look at the images, how can we ignore it?,"" he said.\n\nA total of 292 women who had digital mammography and noncontrast CT scans within one year were included in the study. Of these, 124, or 42.5 percent, were found to have evidence of breast arterial calcification. Mammograms were reviewed by a second radiologist who was blinded to the CAC results. Women with breast arterial calcification were more likely to be older, have high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease, and less likely smokers. Women with established cardiovascular diseases were excluded. Breast arterial calcification was evaluated on a scale from zero to 12 by increasing severity, and CAC was measured on the CT using a validated 0-12 severity score. The overall accuracy of breast arterial calcification for the presence of CAC was 70 percent, and 63 percent of those with CAC also had breast arterial calcification.\n\nTo date, there is no consensus on using CAC as a screening test, though a very large outcome study of 39,000 subjects is underway in the Netherlands. Mammography, however, is widely used and accepted and, as Hecht said, may provide an opportunity to risk stratify asymptomatic women by breast arterial calcification who might have calcium in the coronary arteries and ordinarily would not have been readily considered for cardiovascular screening.\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death among women, yet breast cancer is often the most feared.\n\nRoughly 37 million mammograms are performed annually in the U.S. Mammography is recommended annually for women over 40 years of age by the American Cancer Society and every other year for women 50-75 years old and women at high risk for breast cancer by the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force. Digital mammography is more sensitive to the presence of calcifications and is now available in 96 percent of mammography units in the U.S.\n\nAnother intriguing point that deserves additional study, according to the researchers, is that the nature of the atherosclerosis is different in breast arterial calcification and CAC, making it unclear why one should be related to the other.\n\nHecht stresses that these findings warrant further evaluation and validation in larger studies. Future prospective trials are needed to see what the prognostic significance of breast arterial calcification might be. Because the study involved women who received both mammography and CT scan for clinical indications, these women may have been more likely than the average woman to have coexisting conditions, although Hecht said these were unrelated to heart disease.\n\nThis study is being published simultaneously online in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging, Khurram Nasir, M.D., M.P.H., and John McEvoy, from the Center for Healthcare Advancement and Outcomes at Baptist Health South Florida, said that the report provides impetus to document breast arterial calcification in mammography reports, to improve education of primary care and radiology providers on the link with heart disease, and other actions to establish best practices for incorporating this research into care.\n\n""Even by the conservative estimate of 10 percent, approximately 4 million women nationwide undergoing screening mammography will exhibit breast arterial calcification; with 2 to 3 million of them likely to have signs of premature coronary atherosclerotic disease,"" the authors said. ""Whether the best use of breast arterial calcification is to trigger additional testing or to directly inform preventive treatment decisions, either by flagging high-risk women to their providers or by reclassifying traditional (heart disease) risk estimates, is worth further discussion.""\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded, in part, by the Flight Attendants Medical Research Institute.\n\nThe study, ""Digital Mammography: Screening for Coronary Artery Disease?,"" will be presented on April 3, 2016, at 9:45 a.m. CT/10:45 a.m. ET/3:45 p.m. UTC at the American College of Cardiology\'s 65th Annual Scientific Session in Chicago.

The study looked at digital mammography and computerized tomography (CT) scans of 292 women who had been screened within the past year. A very high percentage of women (42.5 percent) were found to have calcium in their breast arteries.  Among those women, 70 percent also had calcium deposits in their heart arteries. (The CT scans found calcium in breast arteries in 47.5 percent of the women.)

At age 40, the Amherst resident was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, a developmental disorder marked by impaired social skills and difficulty with nonverbal communication. Although highly competent in fields like electronics, sound design, and car mechanics, Robison found his limited ability to read body language and other unspoken cues left him feeling cut off from normal human interaction.\n\nFor the first time in many years, John Elder Robison entered a sixth-floor lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and settled into a chair. He was there to demonstrate — although not actually repeat — a procedure known as transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, in which electromagnetic impulses are fired into carefully targeted areas of a patient’s brain. TMS activates neurological pathways and is most commonly used to treat depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeginning in 2008, Robison voluntarily underwent roughly a dozen TMS sessions as part of a research study conducted at BIDMC’s Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. The results are chronicled in Robison’s new book, “Switched On: A Memoir of Brain Change and Emotional Awakening.”\n\nIn a moving, often harrowing narrative reminiscent of “Awakenings” and other popular works by the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks, Robison writes of the transformations these sessions helped unlock, the welcome ones — and the not so welcome.\n\nAfter his initial TMS session, Robison experienced music on a visceral level he had once known, long ago, but sensed he had lost. He burst into tears. “The experience was richer and deeper, with an added layer of feeling,” he writes. “Perhaps I was hearing music pure and true, without the distorting lens of autism.”\n\nOther striking changes in perception and mood soon followed. Some proved transitory, others seemingly more permanent.\n\n“The change in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,” he said during an interview in a hospital conference room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis book is likely to spark even greater interest — and funding — in TMS as a non-medicinal way to treat symptoms associated with disabilities like autism, epilepsy, ADHD, and dementia. Robison certainly hopes so.\n\n“My world is strikingly different, even if the TMS energy is all dissipated,” he said. He maintains his ability to read body language and communicate his own feelings through facial expression have improved dramatically.\n\n“I feel I hear music with more clarity, too. Whether I think it’s there, or it really is there, it’s all the same,” added Robison, a physically large man who smiles easily and often. To a reporter who first met him a decade ago, the changes in his demeanor are obvious: more relaxed, less guarded, more emotionally engaged.\n\nRobison also happens to be a gifted writer — his 2007 memoir “Look Me in the Eye: My Life With Asperger’s” was a critically acclaimed bestseller. He’s also a prolific blogger with a knack for dredging wry humor out of awkward situations.\n\nStill, for all the positive changes described in “Switched On,” Robison’s fourth book, there were negatives he was forced to deal with. TMS treatments chipped away at what he calls his “protective shield” of autism, he writes, leaving him disoriented and depressed at times.\n\nHis second marriage, to a woman who herself suffered from chronic depression, came undone within a year of his initial TMS sessions. He frequently fell behind schedule at work (Robison runs a high-end car repair business in Springfield and lives in Amherst). Old friendships fell apart. As Robison’s public profile rose — since “Look Me in the Eye,” he has divided his time between the car business and advocating on behalf of autism awareness — it disrupted his life on many levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobison, with research fellow Ali Jannati. Keith Bedford/Globe Staff\n\nAt his lowest point, in 2009, Robison considered killing himself. Gaining and then losing abilities he’d never possessed caused “a mixture of sadness and wonder,” Robison writes, summing up his condition in one word: “jarred.”\n\nRobison has previously written about growing up in Western Massachusetts in an intellectually prominent family (his father taught philosophy, his mother wrote poetry) plagued by alcoholism and mental illness. Much of that dysfunction was also chronicled in “Running With Scissors,” the 2002 best-selling memoir by Robison’s brother, Augusten Burroughs.\n\n“Switched On” revisits that dark and stormy past. Yet it is more than a linear account of a life transformed by cutting-edge medical technology.\n\nA “techno geek” with a deep knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems — he once worked as a sound engineer and special-effects designer for the rock band KISS — Robison delves into the latest brain-research findings and TMS’s potential to help others like himself. He celebrates neurodiversity more generally, too, a subject he has been teaching at William & Mary College and Harvard Medical School.\n\nDuring the interview, Robison addressed the concerns and hopes he took into his TMS sessions, and the impact they’ve had on his life since then. People close to him questioned whether the risk was worth it. Or even if an “improved” version of himself would be someone they could love as much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Some thought I was crazy to let them do that to my brain, but I never had that fear,” said Robison. “The technology was thoroughly familiar to me. And even though I knew these kinds of things could be dangerous if used wrong, I had confidence that a Harvard teaching hospital would use them safely.”\n\nWeighing the risk-reward balance, he continued, “I wondered, what if [the sessions] could really turn me on to being sensitive to other people? I’d concluded that one reason I was kind of down was, I could not receive all these messages of love and kindness coming my way. People would ask, ‘Can’t you tell how happy you made us?’ Well, no, I’d say. I can’t.”\n\nEven a 1 percent chance at success seemed worth the odds, Robison went on. And even if, as he’d been warned, any changes in brain function might last only half as long as the 30-minute treatments themselves.\n\nThe negatives? These, too, he has come to accept.\n\n“I was probably naive at the outset,” he admitted. “I had this idea that if I could only ‘get’ these happy messages, I would be happier. It didn’t occur to me that most of the news out there, most of the emotion, is, if not bad, at least not all good. Not sweetness and light but a world of angst and avarice and greed. It was overpowering.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobison’s TMS research team was led by Harvard neurologist Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, who supplies an introduction to “Switched On.” In a separate interview, Pascual-Leone says Robison’s book demonstrates how small changes in brain function, however temporary, can have a life-changing impact.\n\nImagine, Pascual-Leone says, someone who cannot see color being told the sky is blue — an abstract, meaningless concept. Suddenly, for a brief period, he’s able to see the sky in color. Forever after, the idea of “blue” will no longer be meaningless.\n\n“Now translate that concept to emotions,” he continues. “If you can give [someone like Robison] an idea of what emotions may be hidden behind a voice or face, then it enables his brain, without TMS, to change the way he approaches life and people.”\n\nNevertheless, Pascual-Leone acknowledges that these changes can be challenging as well as beneficial, as Robison describes. A recent paper by the BIDMC team concluded that TMS, while appealing and worth further study, is not yet recommended as an autism treatment. Rather, it may be best used to alleviate certain symptoms associated with spectrum disorder, including depression.\n\nStill, there are a number of clinics currently offering TMS as an autism treatment, a practice that concerns many researchers. “People are desperate to help their loved ones, which I understand,” Pascual-Leone says. “Will it get more attention because of John’s book? Absolutely. But his book does illustrate that the consequences can be long-lasting, and detrimental.”\n\nRobison remains optimistic that as research continues, the potential benefits will outweigh the risks.\n\n“I owe a great debt [to the Harvard team] for helping me see I was not broken or defective,” he said. “That this painful disability of mine was a rare gift.”\n\n“People are scared of the science-fiction aspect to this, but it’s real,” he added. “And what I wrote about in the book isn’t 10 percent of what they’re doing now.”\n\n“Switched On” ends in 2013. Robison, now happily remarried, says he’s become even more militant advocating on behalf of what he calls “my tribe.”\n\n“You can look at my success in the world,” he said, “and it’s not just in my mind. It’s undeniable.”\n\n“The change [after the therapy] in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,” Robison said. Keith Bedford/Globe Staff/Globe Staff\n\nJoseph P.

Massage Therapy May Rub It Out\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption /Group Health Research Institute /Group Health Research Institute\n\nLow back pain is second only to cold symptoms when it comes to complaints that send people to the doctor. Sooner or later, back pain seems to get most of us.\n\nSummary For Patients Read a summary of the findings and their implications from the Annals of Internal Medicine. A Comparison of Massage Therapy and Usual Medical Care for Chronic Low Back Pain\n\nNow, a study in the July 5 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine shows that massage is an effective treatment for lower back pain. In some cases, researchers report, the benefits of massage lasted for six months or longer.\n\nResearchers headed by epidemiologist Daniel Cherkin, a senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, enrolled 401 people with chronic low back pain and no identifiable reason for the pain.\n\nStudy participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments. One group received full-body relaxation massage. A second received targeted deep tissue massage. The third group got the usual care — medication and physical therapy.\n\nIn relaxation massage, often referred to as Swedish massage, a variety of maneuvers are used to promote a feeling of relaxation throughout the body and muscles. Structural massage, commonly referred to as deep tissue massage, targets specific pain related tissues, ligaments and joints.\n\nAfter 10 weeks, the results were dramatic: Nearly two-thirds of the patients who received either type of weekly massage said their back pain was significantly improved or gone altogether. Only about one-third of patients receiving the usual care experienced similar relief.\n\n""We found that both types of massage were equally effective in helping people improve their function and diminish their symptoms,"" Cherkin says. He says massage relieved the pain for six months or more.\n\nPrior studies of massage for back pain had tested only structural forms of massage, not relaxation massage. But relaxation massage is more widely available, and it\'s often less costly.\n\n\'I\'m So Very Lucky\'\n\nPeggy O\'Brien-Murphy was among the study participants. In her late 60s, a retired state employee, O\'Brien Murphy tried just about everything to get rid of the pain in her lower back. The massage therapy finally seemed to do the trick.\n\n""I\'m so very lucky,"" she says.\n\nPrior to the study, O\'Brien-Murphy says she had found herself increasingly debilitated by back pain. At one point, she says she could hardly get out of a chair.\n\n""It was really bad,"" she says. ""In fact, I was pulling myself up the stairs by the banister."" It was difficult getting into the car. And she could no longer walk the hills where she lives. For an active person, this was devastating.\n\nSo when she came upon an ad in her HMO\'s newsletter, Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, she jumped at the chance to take part in the massage study.\n\nAfter just two or three sessions with massage therapist Loretta Lanz, O\'Brien-Murphy said she felt better. After each session she walked around the block, standing straighter and walking further each time. By the end, she felt ""back to normal,"" with a ""spring to my walk and some energy in it!""\n\nFor O\'Brien-Murphy, the massage-therapy experience has been life-changing: She has traveled to China, where she walked all over without problems, and she\'s already planning her next trips.\n\nNo one knows exactly how massage works to relieve pain, says Dr. Richard Deyo of Oregon Health Sciences University, who also took part in the study.\n\n""It may be that it helps with relaxation of muscles that are tense,"" Deyo says. ""But it may also be there are simply more generalized effects of relaxation — in the caring and attention and someone laying hands on — that may all be important.""\n\nResearchers say future studies should look more closely at the benefits of massage and focus on cost-benefit analysis.\n\nAs for O\'Brien-Murphy, she remains free of back pain, but not without some effort on her part. Other studies have shown that building strong and flexible muscles can help prevent back pain. O\'Brien-Murphy never exercised before. But now she does weight training, muscle stretches and aerobic exercise — activities all shown to help prevent recurrence of lower back pain.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A little closer reporting of what the study actually reported – about limitations of the benefits found and about costs – would have resulted in a higher score for this otherwise solid report.</span>","Given the aggressive treatments that some people pursue for chronic low back pain, it is important for journalists to report research that points to a benefit from non-surgical therapies as well.
This isn’t the first study of massage for low back pain. Prior studies haven’t shown much benefit for low back pain that is less than 1 month in duration, but prior studies have shown benefit for those with pain for more than 3 months (chronic). As such these results aren’t breaking new ground. What it does show is that two forms of massage give similar results and that the benefits of massage in terms of pain diminish over time. Massage did show peristent improvement in function at 26 weeks. At 52 weeks function was better in the relaxation massage group but not the structural massage group when compared to usual care (though the direct comparison of the two massage groups didn’t significantly differ).
In summary, this study adds to the evidence that massage provides short-term benefit for patients with chronic low back pain that diminishes over time in terms of pain, but maintains its benefit in terms of function. This is good news, but it isn’t a cure.

Rush University Medical Center in Chicago is the first health care provider in the world to provide this treatment, known as microburst vagus nerve stimulation.\n\nThe treatment is akin to a heart pacemaker. A surgeon places an electronic pulse generator under the skin in the chest and attaches it to the left vagus nerve, which runs down the side of the body from the stem of the brain through the neck and chest to the abdomen.\n\nThe device sends regular electrical pulses through the vagus nerve to the brain to prevent epileptic seizures from occurring. The stimulator’s settings can be changed according to each patient’s needs using a special programming wand, with no additional surgery needed.\n\nDr. Rebecca O’Dwyer, assistant professor of neurology at Rush, is participating in a nationwide clinical study of the initial safety and effectiveness of microburst vagus nerve stimulation in patients who have drug-resistant epilepsy. She enrolled the first patient in the entire study on February 28.\n\n“At the Rush Epilepsy Center, we regularly collaborate with members of the neurosurgery and neuroradiology department in our research endeavors. We look forward to the results of this study and hope we can bring relief to more people with epilepsy,” O’Dwyer said.\n\nRush was the first hospital in Chicago to offer epilepsy patients the original vagal nerve stimulator, which uses mild pulses of electricity, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it in 1997 as an adjunctive treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. “We are now exploring how higher frequency bursts delivered to the vagus nerve will affect epilepsy that does not respond to traditional therapies,” said O’Dwyer.\n\nThe study consists of two groups of patients with epilepsy, enrolling up to 40 patients in total at approximately 15 sites in the United States. The first group will include 20 patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The second group will consist of 20 patients with partial onset seizures, including complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization.\n\nEach patient will participate in the study for a minimum of 15 months. The study will measure the percent change in seizure frequency and occurrence of stimulation-related adverse events in comparison to a patient’s baseline. Activation of various areas of the brain in response to stimulation will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI. Patients also will be evaluated to assess changes from baseline in seizure severity, quality of life, antiepileptic drug use, suicidality and adverse events.\n\nTo be considered for enrollment in the study or for information, contact The Rush Epilepsy Center at 312-942 5939.']","News release recruiting patients for a phase 1 trial skips almost every detail a patient needs to know: what’s different about the device, success rate of similar devices, harms, and more.","The headline, lede and much of the text of this news release from Rush University Medical Center appear to describe the “first” availability of a “new” electronic device treatment for drug-resistant seizure disorders, but in fact the release is a veiled marketing and clinical trial recruitment document that has the potential to significantly mislead readers. Medical centers, particularly those that participate in multi-center phase 1 trials (the exact case here) must often compete to fill their trial quotas by getting the word out to the general public as well as to referring physicians and specialty clinic staff.  We can sympathize with the need. But this release, for the greater part, suggests the microburst vagus nerve stimulator may already be a proven therapy — at least at Rush — for so-called “refractory” epilepsy, when in fact a quick trip to ClinicalTrials.gov points out that it’s a Phase 1 “feasibility” trial to evaluate the “initial safety and effectiveness” of the technology, one derived from earlier versions of electrical brain stimulating devices.
Moreover, although it is technically true that Rush recruited the first patient into the national trial, the emphasis put on the institution’s claim to be the “first” to use it, belies the fact that this is a multi-center trial in which 60 patients at 15 different United States medical centers are participants in the same time frame. Finally, the legitimate news here — that Rush is among 15 medical centers to participate in a study to  see if this technology is safe and effective for intractable seizure patients — is missing most of the information people with epilepsy need to see if they might qualify. All in all, this release misses its marks.

All participants in these studies knew they were taking the oil, which could have affected reports of its effectiveness.\n\n""We know that our placebo rates can be as high as 30 percent, and sometimes higher,"" said Dr. Amy Brooks-Kayal, American Epilepsy Society president, who wasn\'t involved in the studies.\n\n""We don\'t know the real effect of the cannabidiol, and we won\'t until we complete the studies that are ongoing that are placebo-controlled and blinded,"" added Brooks-Kayal, who is also a professor of pediatrics, neurology and pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\nThere also are concerns that cannabidiol may interact badly with some anti-seizure medications approved for epilepsy treatment, according to another study scheduled for presentation at the meeting.\n\nCannabidiol is a major chemical component of marijuana, said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, a neurologist at NYU Langone Medical Center\'s Comprehensive Epilepsy Center in New York City and co-author of one of the studies.\n\nCBD doesn\'t produce intoxication like pot\'s other major chemical compound, THC. But, researchers believe it may interact with a brain receptor that plays a role in the development of seizures, Devinsky said.\n\n""This receptor has several effects, but one of them may be to modulate the calcium inside and outside the neuron, which is very much related to the excitability of nerve cells,"" he explained.\n\nPrevious studies have shown some benefit in adults, and word has spread. Families with adults and children with epilepsy have flocked to states where medical marijuana is legal to seek treatment, Brooks-Kayal said.\n\n""There is a fairly active and vocal group of families in Colorado who are using cannabidiol oils that are made artisanally,"" she said.\n\nTo see whether children with epilepsy would benefit from cannabidiol treatment, Devinsky led a study involving 261 people, mostly children, whose seizures had not been controlled using current anti-seizure medications. The average age of the participants was 11.\n\nEveryone received a British-made cannabidiol oil called Epidiolex, which was administered as a drop on the tongue, Devinsky said. This was in addition to their current drug therapy.\n\nAfter three months, seizure frequency declined by an average 45 percent in all participants. Almost half experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in seizures, and about one of every 10 patients became seizure-free, the study found.\n\n""This was a very, very treatment-resistant group, and the response was very promising,"" Devinsky said.\n\nA second study from the University of California, San Francisco, explored the long-term effectiveness of cannabidiol for children with epilepsy, by adding the marijuana-derived oil to the regular drug regimen of about 25 kids for one year.\n\nThe study found that after a year, the treatment resulted in a 50 percent reduction in seizures for 10 participants -- about 40 percent of the group. One child remained seizure-free, but 12 of the initial participants dropped out of the study because the cannabidiol didn\'t seem to do them any good.\n\nAlthough he said he would prescribe CBD to people with uncontrolled seizures, Devinsky said he is ""very anxious"" to see the results of ongoing randomized, controlled clinical trials. The results of one major trial are expected in the first quarter of 2016, he added.\n\nIf CBD proves effective in controlled trials, it could be two to five years before the drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Devinsky noted.\n\nFederal regulators also will have to weigh potential interactions of cannabidiol with other anti-seizure drugs. Another study scheduled for presentation at the meeting found that CBD appeared to enhance the effects of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam (Keppra), when given to lab mice.\n\nHowever, the oil appeared to interact negatively with two other drugs, clobazam (Onfi) and carbamazepine (Tegretol), the University of Utah researchers found.\n\nData and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on medical marijuana, visit the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.']","Our reviewers questioned whether this preliminary study was worth reporting on. But given that it was, they thought the coverage was informative and balanced.","Efficacy and safety studies of a marijuana-derived oil on children for whom existing drugs fail to control epileptic seizures support moving cannabidiol into clinical studies. That’s good news. Less cheery is encountering stories about the effects of this drug before it has been tested in placebo-controlled, blinded research venues — or even before the research has undergone peer review. The story in this case makes the shortcomings of the evidence a prominent point in the coverage and we applaud this careful approach. But whether desperate parents will heed that signal is another matter. A source notes in the story that a “major” clinical trial’s results will become available early in 2016. Might the more responsible path have been for journalism to bide its time as well?

Two to three times a week was not enough, the researchers found in an earlier study.\n\n""Based on a series of studies performed by our team over the past 5 years, this \'dose\' of exercise has become my prescription for life,"" said senior author Dr. Benjamin Levine, Director of the Institute and Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern. ""I think people should be able to do this as part of their personal hygiene - just like brushing your teeth and taking a shower.""\n\nThe regimen included exercising four to five times a week, generally in 30-minute sessions, plus warmup and cool-down:\n\nOne of the weekly sessions included a high-intensity 30-minute workout, such as aerobic interval sessions in which heart rate tops 95 percent of peak rate for 4 minutes, with 3 minutes of recovery, repeated four times (a so-called ""4 x 4"").\n\nEach interval session was followed by a recovery session performed at relatively low intensity.\n\nOne day\'s session lasted an hour and was of moderate intensity. (As a ""prescription for life,"" Levine said this longer session could be a fun activity such as tennis, aerobic dancing, walking, or biking.)\n\nOne or two other sessions were performed each week at a moderate intensity, meaning the participant would break a sweat, be a little short of breath, but still be able to carry on a conversation -- the ""talk test."" In the study, exercise sessions were individually prescribed based on exercise tests and heart rate monitoring.\n\nOne or two weekly strength training sessions using weights or exercise machines were included on a separate day, or after an endurance session.\n\nStudy participants built up to those levels, beginning with three, 30-minute, moderate exercise sessions for the first 3 months and peaked at 10 months when two high-intensity aerobic intervals were added.\n\nThe more than 50 participants in the study were divided into two groups, one of which received two years of supervised exercise training and the other group, a control group, which participated in yoga and balance training.\n\nAt the end of the two-year study, those who had exercised showed an 18 percent improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25 percent improvement in compliance, or elasticity, of the left ventricular muscle of the heart, Dr. Levine noted. He compared the change in the heart to a stretchy, new rubber band versus one that has gotten stiff sitting in a drawer.\n\nSedentary aging can lead to a stiffening of the muscle in the heart\'s left ventricle, the chamber that pumps oxygen-rich blood back out to the body, he explained.\n\n""When the muscle stiffens, you get high pressure and the heart chamber doesn\'t fill as well with blood. In its most severe form, blood can back up into the lungs. That\'s when heart failure develops,"" said Dr. Levine, who holds the S. Finley Ewing Chair for Wellness at Texas Health Dallas and the Harry S. Moss Heart Chair for Cardiovascular Research. He also holds the Distinguished Professorship in Exercise Sciences at UT Southwestern, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year.\n\nEarlier research by UT Southwestern cardiologists showed that left ventricular stiffening often shows up in middle age in people who don\'t exercise and aren\'t fit, leaving them with small, stiff chambers that can\'t pump blood as well.\n\nHowever, the researchers also found that the heart chamber in competitive masters-level athletes remains large and elastic, and that even four to five days of committed exercise over decades is enough for noncompetitive athletes to reap most of this benefit.\n\nIn the current study, researchers wanted to know if exercise can restore the heart\'s elasticity in previously sedentary individuals - especially if begun in late middle age. Previous studies from Dr. Levine\'s research program have shown substantial improvements in cardiac compliance in young individuals after a year of training, but surprisingly little change if the training was started after age 65.\n\nTo start the study, researchers recruited 53 participants, ages 45 to 64. Many came from the Dallas Heart Study, which includes 6,000 Dallas residents and is the only single-center heart study of its size and multiethnic composition. The Dallas Heart Study is designed to improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of heart disease.\n\n###\n\nThe new study appears in Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association. Collaborators on the study included first author Dr. Erin Howden, Research Fellow with UT Southwestern\'s Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and the IEEM and now a faculty member at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia. Funding came from the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association.\n\nAbout UT Southwestern Medical Center\n\nUT Southwestern, one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation, integrates pioneering biomedical research with exceptional clinical care and education. The institution\'s faculty has received six Nobel Prizes, and includes 22 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 18 members of the National Academy of Medicine, and 14 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators. The faculty of more than 2,700 is responsible for groundbreaking medical advances and is committed to translating science-driven research quickly to new clinical treatments. UT Southwestern physicians provide care in about 80 specialties to more than 100,000 hospitalized patients, 600,000 emergency room cases, and oversee approximately 2.2 million outpatient visits a year.']",The release does a good job outlining the prescribed exercise regime. It could have dialed back on claims that aren’t directly supported by the research.,"Getty Images
This news release describes a small study (~50 subjects) from UT Southwestern Medical Center showing that fairly aggressive and regular exercise in sedentary, middle-aged individuals can marginally increase maximum oxygen uptake and moderately improve the elasticity of the main pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle).
Although the news release does a good job outlining the prescribed exercise regime, it makes unwarranted and confusing claims about reversing damage from “heart aging,” and suggesting the findings might “help prevent risk of future heart failure.”
This language is not justified. The research can’t tell us if risk for heart failure has been reduced in these study participants. Nor does it establish what is meant by “heart aging” and how that has been “reversed” by the intervention. The news release would have been markedly improved if such terms had been dropped, and focused more on what is — and is not known — about poor fitness as a risk factor for heart failure.

Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center have found.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors, which grew out of research begun more than 20 years ago at UT Southwestern Medical Center, work by interfering with processes that fuel the growth of cells.\n\nInvestigators conducted a pre-clinical trial in mice transplanted with kidney cancer from over 20 patients and showed that the HIF-2 inhibitor PT2399 controlled cancer in half of the tumors, according to a study published in the journal Nature.\n\n""This is a completely new treatment for kidney cancer. We want to make HIF-2 inhibitors available to patients and are currently carrying out clinical trials,"" said Dr. James Brugarolas, Director of the Kidney Cancer Program, who is leading an $11 million SPORE grant from the National Cancer Institute seeking to translate new discoveries into novel therapies for kidney cancer patients. Part of the SPORE grant, one of just two directly related to kidney cancer in the nation, is focused on further researching HIF-2 inhibitors.\n\nIn a previous report, Dr. Kevin Courtney, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and a coauthor of the current study, reported at the American Association of Clinical Oncology annual meeting that HIF-2 inhibitors were safe in patients and had activity even in heavily pretreated patients. In the study in Nature, investigators show that HIF-2 inhibition was able to control metastatic kidney cancer even after 7 lines of prior therapy. See video.\n\nThe findings show that HIF-2 is a promising target to combat kidney cancer, said Dr. Brugarolas, senior author and a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research at UT Southwestern.\n\nNearly 400,000 Americans are now living with a diagnosis of kidney cancer and more than 60,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Texas has the fifth highest rate of this cancer in the U.S.\n\nWhat is HIF-2\n\nHIFs or hypoxia-inducible factors, like HIF-2, allow the body\'s cells to adjust to low-oxygen environments. HIFs activate programs that promote the development of blood vessels, facilitate oxygen delivery and promote efficient nutrient utilization. Kidney cancer cells hijack the same system to fuel their growth.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors work by suppressing the effects of HIF-2 which include downregulating an important protein called VEGF that promotes the formation of blood vessels needed for tumors to grow.\n\n""Unlike existing VEGF inhibitors, the HIF-2 inhibitor blocks VEGF only in the cancer and therefore does not cause cardiac toxicity or hypertension,"" Dr. Brugarolas explained.\n\nNew HIF-2 findings\n\nIn the Nature study, researchers compared the two drugs head to head and found that the HIF-2 inhibitor was more active than sunitinib and that it was active against tumors progressing on sunitinib.\n\n""Furthermore, it was also better tolerated. As sometimes happens in patients, mice on sunitinib were sickly and lost weight, whereas mice on the HIF-2 inhibitor gained weight while on the study,"" he said.\n\nResearchers surprisingly found a subset of tumors that do not respond to the drug, but were able to identify biomarkers that, once verified, would help determine which patients are more likely to benefit from HIF-2 therapies.\n\n""HIF-2 is believed to be the most important driver of kidney cancer. Traditionally, proteins like HIF-2 were disregarded as drug targets because their shape made it nearly impossible to design drugs against them,"" Dr. Brugarolas said. ""The approaches we have taken pave the way for identifying drug candidates for other proteins that have traditionally been considered undruggable.""\n\nHIF-2 also appears significant in other types of cancer, including deadly brain cancers called glioblastomas and non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung malignancy.\n\nHow HIF-2 came to be\n\nIn 1997, UT Southwestern researchers Dr. Steven McKnight, Chairman of Biochemistry, and molecular geneticist Dr. David Russell, Vice Provost and Dean of Basic Research, led research discovering and describing the protein encoded by the EPAS1 gene, also known as HIF-2α, the main HIF-2 component. Over the course of a decade, the laboratories of Dr. Richard Bruick, Professor of Biochemistry, holder of the Michael L. Rosenberg Scholar in Biomedical Research, and a coauthor of the current study, and Dr. Kevin Gardner, Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry, solved the structure of HIF-2α.\n\nBy 2009, researchers had identified a ""sweet spot"" where drugs could bind and shut down HIF-2 activity. Using the Simmons Cancer Center\'s High-Throughput Screening, scientists tested more than 200,000 chemicals to see which ones could interfere with HIF-2, identifying several potential drug-like compounds. The most promising compounds were licensed to Peloton Therapeutics, Inc., a biotech firm co-founded by Dr. McKnight and based at UT Southwestern\'s BioCenter campus. In 2014, the first HIF-2 inhibitor, an oral drug known as PT2385, entered clinical trials in patients with advanced or metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma.\n\nHIF-2 inhibitors also are the target of UTSW\'s recent $11 million SPORE (Specialized Program of Research Excellence) award. Investigators will further biomarkers to identify patients most likely to respond to the HIF-2 inhibitor, as well as to anticipate ways in which the tumor may evade the drug\'s impact.\n\nUT Southwestern\'s SPORE program involves four innovative disease and clinical research teams targeting adult and pediatric kidney cancer. Other UTSW SPORE investigators are looking at the function of a gene that identifies a cluster of particularly aggressive tumors, in hopes of identifying vulnerabilities that can be targeted with drugs; examining kidney cancer metabolism to distinguish aggressive from less active tumors, potentially yielding a tailored treatment approach; and evaluating novel subtypes of childhood kidney cancer.\n\nThe HIF-2 research team\n\nThe Nature research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health including the SPORE; Peloton Therapeutics, Inc.; and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas; the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (Center for Translational Medicine); National Natural Science Foundation of China; and philanthropy, including the Tom Green Memorial fund.\n\nMore than 30 researchers contributed to the study, including Dr. Payal Kapur, Associate Professor of Pathology; Dr. Ivan Pedrosa, Associate Professor of Radiology in the Advanced Imaging Research Center who holds the Jack Reynolds, M.D., Chair in Radiology; Dr. Xiankai Sun, Associate Professor of Radiology in the Advanced Imaging Research Center who holds the Dr. Jack Krohmer Professorship in Radiation Physics; Dr. Xian-Jin Xie, Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Yang Xie, Associate Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Tae Hyun Hwang, Assistant Professor of Clinical Sciences; Dr. Guiyang Hao, Assistant Professor of Radiology; Dr. Eugene Frenkel, Professor of Internal Medicine and Radiology who holds the Raymond D. and Patsy R.

However, the extensive disclosure discussion was a strong point of this release.","This is a mouse study of a product called PT2399 from a class of drugs called HIF-2 inhibitors that have purportedly been shown to be “more effective and better tolerated than the standard of care drug” in the treatment of kidney cancer. While this is promising research, appropriate language to say that this is a very small, very preliminary and non-definitive rodent study was largely missing. A novel compound can be very exciting for the researchers, those who are making and promoting it, and the institution that has a financial interest in its success, but that excitement needs to be tempered with a ‘reality check’ on the challenges of translating animal research to human outcomes. from observers unconnected to the research.  Without that, the news release reads as a mere PR exercise, designed to generate premature (yet possibly unfounded) excitement.
[Editor’s note: The news release says, “In the study in Nature, investigators show that HIF-2 inhibition was able to control metastatic kidney cancer even after 7 lines of prior therapy.

Al-Khatib, the lead researcher.\n\n“There are some situations in which physicians think it is in the best interests of patients to get the devices in” even when the guidelines don’t call for it, she said. “But even if you account for that, [more than 1 in 5] is surprising. We did not expect the number to be that high.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe data also show clearly that there is a significant difference in the rate of inappropriate implants between electrophysiologists, who have specialized training in use of the devices, and other heart doctors, said Dr. Shephal Doshi, director of cardiac electrophysiology and pacing at Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, who was not involved in the research. Electrophysiologists appear to have “a better understanding of the appropriateness” of the use of the devices, Doshi said.\n\nImplantable defibrillators administer an electrical shock to a heart that is beating erratically to jolt it back into a normal rhythm. They can be lifesaving in appropriate patients. The devices cost $20,000 to $30,000, and normal hospitalization expenses can bring the total cost to $40,000 or more.\n\nIn previous studies, Al-Khatib and her colleagues have examined underuse of the devices and found that many patients who could benefit from the defibrillators did not get them. This time, she said, “we decided to look at the flip side.”\n\nThe researchers examined a registry of implants maintained by the American College of Cardiology that covers an estimated 95% of all U.S. implants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team studied 111,707 implants for what is called primary prevention, performed between January 2006 and June 2009. Primary prevention is for patients who had not had a recent heart attack or a problem with the bottom chambers of the heart.\n\nThe team found that 25,145 of the implants were for causes that were not covered by the guidelines. Of those, 9,257 were in patients who had had a heart attack within 40 days and 15,604 were in patients with newly diagnosed heart failure. These problems fall outside the guidelines because they have not been studied in clinical trials of the devices or because clinical trials have shown that the devices are not effective in treating them.\n\nDeaths in the hospital among patients receiving defibrillators outside the guidelines were 0.57%, compared with 0.18% among those who received them within the guidelines. About 3.23% of those receiving the devices outside guidelines had complications, compared with 2.41% of those within guidelines.\n\nThe median length of a hospital stay was three days for those outside the guidelines, compared with one day for those within them.\n\nDoshi noted that the guidelines allowed some leeway for doctors to use their judgment. “We do procedures based on experience and a sense of what is appropriate.... If we just practiced based on guidelines, we wouldn’t need doctors. But clearly we need to understand this better.”\n\nDr. Robert Ruelaz, an electrophysiologist at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, said there was a lot of self-imposed pressure on doctors who did implants because they care deeply about their patients, and that sometimes this might prompt them to step outside the guidelines in the hopes that the implants can help.\n\n“Some people will probably try to say doctors are doing this to make more money,” Ruelaz said. Most of the time, “what I see is that doctors are concerned about protecting their patients from dying.”\n\nthomas.maugh@latimes.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;""> A generally solid story that would have been stronger if it picked up on issues addressed in an editorial accompaying the journal article on which the story is based. </span>","This story about a study on the overuse of implanted defibrillators packs in more information than many competing stories and hits nearly all of our marks, giving readers good context and a clear understanding of the study and its implications. We would have liked to have seen a bit more background information on the registry and on the guidelines. We are mystified by the lack of attention to the accompanying editorial in the journal that places the study into an important frame of reference and provides a good counter balance.

Approves Heart Drug Entresto Said to Cut Death Risk by 20%,"['Novartis is considering trying so-called risk-sharing with some health plans, meaning it might charge more if the drug really does keep people out of the hospital and less if it doesn’t. But such talks, while encouraging, are still in the early stages, a Novartis spokesman said.\n\nTimothy Anderson, pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said in a recent note that Entresto was “likely to become a mega-brand over time” but that the initial uptake was “likely to be on the slower side given the entrenched nature of off-patent ACE inhibitors.” He said it was highly unusual that there were no major competitors for Entresto on the way, giving it a “long runway.”\n\nIn a clinical trial with more than 8,400 participants, patients were randomly assigned to take either Entresto or enalapril, an ACE inhibitor. Patients in both groups of the study could also take other drugs, such as beta blockers, as their doctors saw fit.\n\nAfter about 27 months, 21.8 percent of those taking Entresto had either died from cardiovascular causes or had been hospitalized for worsening heart failure, compared with 26.5 percent for those taking enalapril. That represented a relative risk reduction of 20 percent using a measure known as the hazard ratio.\n\nNovartis said that about 2.2 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which was approved for patients with so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is sponsoring another study to see if the drug is effective for those with preserved ejection fraction, which accounts for half of heart failure cases.\n\nThe F.D.A. said that the main side effects were low blood pressure, high blood potassium levels and kidney impairment. It said there were also cases of angioedema, an allergic reaction that usually results in swelling of the lips or face but can be life threatening if swelling interferes with breathing. Blacks and those with a previous history of the condition were at increased risk, it said.\n\nEntresto is a combination of two drugs, one of which is valsartan, the active ingredient in the blockbuster drug that Novartis sells as Diovan but which now faces generic competition. The other ingredient, sacubitril, inhibits an enzyme known as neprilysin, a new mechanism of action for a heart failure drug.']","Strong overall, this story from the New York Times business section could have used some input from health experts to round out the coverage.","The story focuses on FDA’s approval of a drug called Entresto for use by patients with certain types of heart failure, and discusses the potential profits the drug may accrue for pharmaceutical company Novartis. This story from the business section is as much about the financial implications of the approval as it is about health; the story addresses cost in depth and explores how the drug would fit into a market where competing generic drugs are often less expensive. Overall, there’s plenty of useful information and the story covers quite a bit of ground in not very much space. But a few things could have been done better, particularly a headline and introduction that do not fully explain the extent to which the drug could be of benefit. In addition, the technical language the story uses may make it difficult for many readers to understand which heart patients might benefit from the drug. A comment from an independent expert about the health implications of the drug might have helped with some of these issues. Skeptical voices regarding this new drug combination seem to be few and far between, but this post at the Health Care Renewal blog provides some critical analysis of the study that’s the basis for Entresto’s approval — for those who wish to dive deeper.

The drug, talazoparib, works by blocking an enzyme called poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), thus preventing cancer cells from killing healthy ones.\n\nIn a phase 3 trial of 431 women, funded by the drug\'s maker, those who received talazoparib lived longer without their cancer progressing than women treated with standard chemotherapy by an average of three months, researchers found.\n\n""For women with metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA mutation, PARP inhibitors may be considered for their treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nWhen it\'s functioning properly, BRCA actually helps repair damaged DNA and prevents tumors, but when BRCA1 and BRCA2 go awry, they encourage breast cancers.\n\nPARP inhibitors such as talazoparib appear to interfere with the function of mutated BRCA in breast cells, causing them to die rather replicate.\n\nIn addition, several ongoing studies are looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors ""to try to expand who may benefit or lengthen how long they may work,"" Litton said.\n\nThe trial results are preliminary, as talazoparib has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn January, the FDA approved the first PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer.\n\nSimilar drugs have already been used to treat advanced, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, according to the agency.\n\nIn the current trial, the women who were randomly selected to receive talazoparib had a higher response rate to treatment than women who received standard chemotherapy: 63 percent versus 27 percent, the researchers found.\n\nThe drug does have side effects. Among women receiving talazoparib, 55 percent had blood disorders, mostly anemia, compared with 38 percent of those receiving standard chemotherapy.\n\nIn addition, 32 percent of the women receiving talazoparib had other side effects, compared with 38 percent of those on standard chemotherapy.\n\nOncologist Dr. Marisa Weiss is the founder and chief medical officer of Breastcancer.org. ""Smart medicines like this PARP inhibitor work better than traditional chemo in women with HER2-negative metastatic disease and a BRCA1/2 genetic mutation,"" she said.\n\nThis targeted form of treatment takes advantage of a weakness in the BRCA gene to further cripple the cancer cell\'s ability to repair itself, grow and spread, said Weiss, who was not involved with the study.\n\nNormal cells are mostly spared. As a result, more cancer cells are killed with fewer side effects, Weiss said.\n\n""Most importantly, patients themselves have reported a better experience with less hair loss and improved quality of life,"" she said.\n\nWeiss advises women with advanced breast cancer to have genetic testing.\n\n""In both my clinical practice and within the online support community, we advise women with metastatic breast cancer to get genetic testing upon diagnosis, in order to get the best care first,"" she said.\n\nThe trial was funded by drug maker Pfizer, and the results were published Aug. 15 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on breast cancer, visit Breastcancer.org.']","To its credit, the story did a good job explaining how many women experienced adverse events in the treatment group and the control group.","This HealthDay story covers a clinical trial of a new drug for breast cancer – one that may be useful in women with BRCA mutations. The opening sentence is misleading, saying that the drug, talazoparib, improves survival. The study found that talazoparib helped women go longer without progression of their cancer. It remains to be seen if they live longer. It’s an important distinction that we think should be made crystal clear for readers.
Also, there is already an FDA-approved cancer drug that works like this one. The story never explains: Why do we need another one? Is this one novel?

Results from an approach dubbed metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration are now available online in the journal Aging.\n\nThe study, which comes jointly from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the UCLA Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research is the first to objectively show that memory loss in patients can be reversed, and improvement sustained, using a complex, 36-point therapeutic personalized program that involves comprehensive changes in diet, brain stimulation, exercise, optimization of sleep, specific pharmaceuticals and vitamins, and multiple additional steps that affect brain chemistry.\n\n“All of these patients had either well-defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI), subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) or had been diagnosed with AD before beginning the program,” said author Dale Bredesen, MD, a professor at the Buck Institute and professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, who noted that patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work and those struggling at their jobs were able to improve their performance. “Follow up testing showed some of the patients going from abnormal to normal.”\n\nOne of the more striking cases involved a 66-year old professional man whose neuropsychological testing was compatible with a diagnoses of MCI and whose PET scan showed reduced glucose utilization indicative of AD. An MRI showed hippocampal volume at only the 17th percentile for his age. After 10 months on the protocol a follow-up MRI showed a dramatic increase of his hippocampal volume to the 75th percentile, with an associated absolute increase in volume of nearly 12 percent.\n\nIn another instance, a 69-year old professional man and entrepreneur, who was in the process of shutting down his business, went on the protocol after 11 years of progressive memory loss. After six months, his wife, co-workers and he noted improvement in memory. A life-long ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in his head returned and he reported an ability to remember his schedule and recognize faces at work. After 22 months on the protocol he returned for follow-up quantitative neuropsychological testing; results showed marked improvements in all categories with his long-term recall increasing from the 3rd to 84th percentile. He is expanding his business.\n\nAnother patient, a 49-year old woman who noted progressive difficulty with word finding and facial recognition went on the protocol after undergoing quantitative neuropsychological testing at a major university. She had been told she was in the early stages of cognitive decline and was therefore ineligible for an Alzheimer’s prevention program. After several months on the protocol she noted a clear improvement in recall, reading, navigating, vocabulary, mental clarity and facial recognition. Her foreign language ability had returned. Nine months after beginning the program she did a repeat of the neuropsychological testing at the same university site. She no longer showed evidence of cognitive decline.\n\nAll but one of the ten patients included in the study are at genetic risk for AD, carrying at least one copy of the APOE4 allele. Five of the patients carry two copies of APOE4 which gives them a 10-12 fold increased risk of developing AD. “We’re entering a new era,” said Bredesen. “The old advice was to avoid testing for APOE because there was nothing that could be done about it. Now we’re recommending that people find out their genetic status as early as possible so they can go on prevention.” Sixty-five percent of the Alzheimer’s cases in this country involve APOE4; with seven million people carrying two copies of the ApoE4 allele.\n\nBredesen’ s systems-based approach to reverse memory loss follows the abject failure of monotherapies designed to treat AD and the success of combination therapies to treat other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and HIV. Bredesen says decades of biomedical research, both in his and other labs, has revealed that an extensive network of molecular interactions is involved in AD pathogenesis, suggesting that a broader-based therapeutic approach may be more effective. “Imagine having a roof with 36 holes in it, and your drug patched one hole very well—the drug may have worked, a single ‘hole’ may have been fixed, but you still have 35 other leaks, and so the underlying process may not be affected much,” Bredesen said. “We think addressing multiple targets within the molecular network may be additive, or even synergistic, and that such a combinatorial approach may enhance drug candidate performance, as well.”\n\nWhile encouraged by the results of the study, Bredesen admits more needs to be done. “The magnitude of improvement in these ten patients is unprecedented, providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective,” Bredesen said. “Even though we see the far-reaching implications of this success, we also realize that this is a very small study that needs to be replicated in larger numbers at various sites.” Plans for larger studies are underway.\n\nCognitive decline is often listed as the major concern of older adults. Already, Alzheimer’s disease affects approximately 5.4 million Americans and 30 million people globally. Without effective prevention and treatment, the prospects for the future are bleak. By 2050, it’s estimated that 160 million people globally will have the disease, including 13 million Americans, leading to potential bankruptcy of the Medicare system. Unlike several other chronic illnesses, Alzheimer’s disease is on the rise--recent estimates suggest that AD has become the third leading cause of death in the United States behind cardiovascular disease and cancer.\n\nTHE BREDESEN PROTOCOL, Dr. Bredesen’s book describing for a lay audience the interventions described in this paper, will be released by Penguin Random House in May 2017. Dr. Bredesen hopes to eventually transform the perception and reality of Alzheimer’s disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition.\n\nCitation: Reversal of Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer’s Disease\n\nOther collaborators on the study include Edwin C.

The program includes as many as 36 interventions which must be followed. Right out of the starting gate the release misinforms by using the terms mild cognitive impairment, subjective cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease interchangeably. They are not the same.
The study reports “unprecedented” improvement in 10 patients with “early Alzheimer’s (AD) or its precursors” who adhered to the protocol, dubbed “metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration,” or MEND, for five to 24 months. All but one of the patients had genes (APOE) associated with Alzheimer’s. The news release provides data on just three of the cases in the study and does not discuss costs or potential challenges of adhering to this protocol.
The news release reveals that the developer of the program, University of California, Los Angeles neurology professor Dale Bredesen, M.D., has a deal to publish a book for lay readers in 2017. Moreover, researchers say their findings are strong enough to warrant widespread genetic testing so those at risk for the disease can receive preventive measures. The book deal and the recommendation of genetic testing are troubling since there are just a handful of case studies to back up the program. Bredesen himself is quoted in the news release acknowledging the need for large-scale clinical trials. But the minor use of cautious language in describing the study as “small” and the call for future larger trials do not make up for the intentional muddying of the symptoms of age-related memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease.

Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic have a vaccine in early-stage clinical tests.\n\nThe early-stage Phase I trial of GSK’s vaccine was primarily designed to test safety, but Adrian Hill, who led the work at Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said it was “encouraging” that the shot also prompted responses from the immune system.\n\n“The safety profile is pretty much as we’d hoped and the immune responses are okay, but not great,” he told Reuters.\n\nThe data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were from 60 healthy volunteers given the vaccine in Britain between Sept. 17 and Nov. 18 last year.\n\nThe volunteers got one of three doses - low, medium, or high - and data from 28 days after vaccination showed the shot was safe at these doses, with only mild side effects.\n\n“People typically experienced mild symptoms that lasted for one or maybe two days, such as pain or reddening at the injection site, and occasionally people felt feverish,” Hill said.\n\nHowever, the antibody response was weaker than was found in a trial of the same Ebola vaccine in macaque monkeys, in which the animals were also found to be protected.\n\nHill said the lower antibody levels, together with a lower response detected in the immune system’s T-cells, suggested to him that a booster may well be needed.\n\nJeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity which helped fund the trial, said it provided “good initial evidence that the GSK vaccine will be safe to use in people”.\n\n“However, we still don’t know whether it will provide protection against Ebola infection in a real-world situation,” he said. “That’s why trials in West Africa of this, and the other vaccines in development, must begin as soon possible.”']","With a condition as panic-inducing as Ebola infection has been, stories might be tempted to get over-enthusiastic about the potential for an experimental vaccine. This story didn’t.","This is a well-balanced, well-written story that lacked only a few minor details. We thought that a few words about cost and some discussion of other potential prevention/treatment approaches would have been ideal. Although independent sources were not included, those associated with the study presented very thoughtful and informative comments.

REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nThe patient, who had both HIV infection and leukemia, received the bone marrow transplant in 2007 from a donor who had a genetic mutation known to give patients a natural immunity to the virus.\n\nNearly four years after the transplant, the patient is free of the virus and it does not appear to be hiding anywhere in his body, Thomas Schneider of Berlin Charite hospital and colleagues said.\n\n“Our results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient,” they wrote in the journal Blood.\n\nAIDS researchers have rejected the approach on any kind of scale for patients with HIV. A bone marrow transplant is a last-ditch treatment for cancers such as leukemia.\n\nIt requires destruction of a patient’s own bone marrow — itself a harrowing process — and then a transplant from a donor who has a near-exact blood and immune system type. Months of recovery are needed while the transplant grows and reconstitutes the patient’s immune system.\n\n“It’s not practical and it can kill people,” said Dr. Robert Gallo of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland, who helped discover the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.\n\n“It is possibly a cure, that’s for sure, you won’t know for absolute sure until the person dies and undergoes extreme PCR (genetic) analysis of post-mortem tissue.”\n\nThe mutation affects a receptor, a cellular doorway, called CCR5, that the AIDS virus uses to get into the cells it infects.\n\nSince the 1990s scientists have known that some people, mostly of Northern European descent, have the mutation and are rarely infected with HIV.\n\n“They are uninfectable, virtually,” Gallo said.\n\nSome researchers are working on the idea of gene therapy to treat or try to cure HIV, but the technology is still in experimental stages.\n\n“I don’t want to throw cold water on an interesting thing, but that’s what it is — an interesting thing,” Gallo said.\n\nSchneider’s team has been following the patient, taking samples from his colon, liver, spinal fluid and brain as he developed various conditions that justified the tests. They tested all these samples for evidence of the virus, which can be difficult to detect unless it is actively infecting cells.\n\nAll these places are suspected “reservoirs” where HIV can hide out for years, to rebound in patients who stop taking drugs that suppress the infection.\n\nThis patient appears to have a fully functioning immune system, they found, which appears genetically identical to cells from the donor — not the patient’s own immune cells.\n\nSchneider’s team found no evidence of HIV anywhere.\n\n“From these results, it is reasonable to conclude that cure of HIV infection has been achieved in this patient,” they wrote.\n\nThe AIDS virus infects 33 million people globally and has killed more than 25 million since the pandemic began in the 1980s. Cocktails of strong drugs can suppress the virus, keeping patients healthy and reducing the chance they will infect others, but there is no vaccine.']","This report on an extreme treatment that may have eliminated HIV from one person in an almost unique situation included a wealth of caution, which is warranted, since standard antiretroviral therapy offers decades of good quality life to people with HIV.","The quote marks around the word “cure” in the headline were a sign of the cautious approach of this story. Instead of allowing a sense of hyperbole to permeate, as we saw in other coverage of the same study, we were glad to see many of the appropriate caveats included. The story should have been more specific about the enormous hazards of bone marrow transplants and told readers of their high cost.

It comes from the fiber-optic tip of Metson\'s endoscope, which also holds a high-res camera lens.\n\nOn the monitor, you can see the miniature instruments he\'s using to cut away inflamed tissue and snip away pieces of eggshell-thin bone that block Butler\'s sinuses and give her nonstop headaches. To avoid poking through to the brain or into the orbit of an eye, there\'s a device around the patient\'s head with a guidance system that tells Metson, in three dimensions, exactly where his sharp instruments are on a CT scan of Butler\'s head.\n\nAfter an hour or so of this delicate work, Metson has opened up the 72-year-old woman\'s sinuses so they can drain. ""The next time she gets a cold,"" he says, ""her membranes are not going to swell and block the sinuses the way they have in the past. They\'re going to stay open.""\n\nThis is modern sinus surgery. It\'s a lot less brutal than the old days -- back in the early 1980s. Then, surgeons cut through the face and mouth, scraped out the sinuses and left patients bruised and scarred. Often they were no better off, sometimes worse.\n\nAdvances since then have persuaded more doctors to do sinus surgery. So a lot more people are getting it -- around 300,000 a year, making it one of the most common operations.\n\nBut how good is it, in terms of giving patients relief from the pain, breathing difficulty and fatigue of chronic sinusitis?\n\n""Surgery is usually not curative,"" Metson says. ""But probably in over 90 percent of the cases, it does significantly improve a patient\'s quality of life. He or she will still have infections after surgery. But hopefully they\'ll be less frequent, less severe and shorter in duration. A brief course of antibiotics will work better after surgery.""\n\nHealth Columnist Opts For Sinus Surgery\n\nJudy Foreman, another of Metson\'s patients, offers an example of both how surgery can help -- and why patients\' expectations shouldn\'t be too high.\n\nForeman had sinus surgery two years ago, when she was 64, after trying everything else. (See sidebar.) She rinsed out her sinuses faithfully with saltwater. She tried decongestants, antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays. Over and over, Metson prescribed antibiotics.\n\nSoothing Sinus Pain Surgery may be less debilitating than it once was, but it’s still the last resort for most people suffering from sinus problems. Here are three simpler treatments that may offer sinus relief. Nasal irrigation, also known as nasal douche or nasal lavage, is one option. The idea is to rinse the sinuses with saltwater. The easiest way is with a bulb syringe or neti pot, which looks like a small tea pot. As the saline solution passes through one nostril and out the other, it clears mucus, dust and allergen particles from the sinus cavities. (Several YouTube videos offer tutorials on nasal irrigation.) The technique might seem peculiar, but it\'s nothing new. It likely originated from yoga traditions as a way to fight cold symptoms, but it went mainstream after a nod from Oprah. Studies show that nasal irrigation seems to work. A 2009 review of research by The Cochrane Library found evidence that nasal irrigation with saltwater can relieve symptoms and can help as a complementary treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. Kits for nasal irrigation usually cost $10 to $20 and are sold in drugstores. Another option is corticosteroid nasal sprays. According to the Mayo Clinic, corticosteroids imitate hormones and can help alleviate inflammation. However, the sprays seem to provide only temporary relief for most users. A few small studies suggest that acupuncture may also benefit some people with sinus problems, but, as one study in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine indicated, more research is needed. —Whitney Blair Wyckoff\n\nFor about 80 percent of patients, these nonsurgical alternatives manage the problem adequately, Metson says. But Foreman was in the other 20 percent.\n\nForeman writes a health column for The Boston Globe and other newspapers, so she\'s an unusually well-informed patient. ""I read an article about people feeling less tired all the time after having had surgery, and I thought, boy, I would really like that,"" she says.\n\nWhen she asked Metson about surgery, he said most people with her degree of sinus problems would have had it long before.\n\n""I thought, \'OK, so I\'m just being scared,\' "" Foreman says. She didn\'t like to think of someone sticking sharp instruments up her nose and cutting away delicate tissue. But when she overcame her squeamishness and finally had the operation, she found it wasn\'t nearly as bad as she thought it would be.\n\n""It\'s uncomfortable,"" she reports. ""Afterwards you have these cotton wads up your nose and, of course, you can\'t breathe with all this stuff in your nose."" But she didn\'t hurt very much. ""I was so glad to get it over with that I would say the pain was not bad at all.""\n\nDisappointed With Outcome\n\nAnd the outcome? Now she has three or four sinus infections a year instead of five or more. They\'re not as bad as before. Still, she\'s disappointed.\n\n""I\'m not like a person without this problem,"" she says. ""I get a cold and I freak out because I know it\'s going to be there for three weeks. Other people get it and they\'re done in five days.""\n\nForeman wrote a column about her surgery. Two years later, she\'s still getting e-mail from people asking whether they should have it.\n\n""I say, \'Go for it!\' Because I think it\'s made enough of a difference that I\'m glad I did it,"" Foreman says. She\'d consider a second operation, but Metson says usually that\'s advised only for patients with nasal polyps that regrow -- not a problem she has.\n\nRarely A Cure\n\ntoggle caption Richard Knox/NPR\n\nMetson says most of his patients do better than Foreman. But surgery rarely cures them. That\'s because surgery doesn\'t touch the root cause of chronic sinusitis.\n\nSurgeons can cut away bone and membranes that block sinuses. But they can\'t stop the inflammation some people are prone to, and that inflammation can cause new obstructions.\n\nTo tackle that problem, researchers have discovered five genes involved in that inflammatory process. Metson hopes drugs will be developed to regulate those genes.\n\n""And if we can use those as novel targets for, let\'s say, nasal sprays or medications, we may be able to treat people like Judy without surgery,"" Metson says. ""Or we\'ll do surgery and follow it up after surgery with these sprays.""\n\nThat, he says, will be the next big advance in sinus treatment.']","Sometimes you can get away with breaking the rules. This story revolves around the experience of a single patient, but the specific patient and the way her tale was handled make all the difference.","While we typically wouldn’t advise reporters to focus exclusively on a single patient’s experience, as this story about endoscopic surgery for treating sinus infections did, the result here is a winner thanks to the patient’s familiarity with the subject and unusually dispassionate perspective. She is the relatively rare patient in a health story who acknowledges being disappointed with the outcome of a new treatment. 
Notable strengths of the story include its measured tone, its extensive discussion of nonsurgical alternatives, and its emphasis on the incremental benefits experienced by most patients (e.g. surgery is ""rarely a cure""). The story could have provided a bit more information about the different types of sinus problems people suffer from (e.g. sinusitis with and without polyps, etc) and what kinds of studies support endoscopic surgery for chronic sinus infections. It also failed to provide enough detail regarding the costs and harms of the treatment.

The research is also the first to show that diet and lifestyle may play a greater role than genetics in cataract development and severity.\n\nCataracts occur naturally with age and cloud the eye’s lens, turning it opaque. Despite the advent of modern cataract removal surgery, cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness globally.1 Researchers at King’s College London looked at whether certain nutrients from food or supplements could help prevent cataract progression. They also tried to find out how much environmental factors such as diet mattered versus genetics.\n\nThe team examined data from more than 1,000 pairs of female twins from the United Kingdom. Participants answered a food questionnaire to track the intake of vitamin C and other nutrients, including vitamins A, B, D, E, copper, manganese and zinc. To measure the progression of cataracts, digital imaging was used to check the opacity of their lenses at around age 60. They performed a follow-up measurement on 324 pairs of the twins about 10 years later.\n\nDuring the baseline measurement, diets rich in vitamin C were associated with a 20 percent risk reduction for cataract. After 10 years, researchers found that women who reported consuming more vitamin C-rich foods had a 33 percent risk reduction of cataract progression.\n\nGenetic factors accounted for 35 percent of the difference in cataract progression. Environmental factors, such as diet, accounted for 65 percent. These results make the study the first to suggest that genetic factors may be less important in progression of cataract than previously thought. How vitamin C inhibits cataract progression may have to do with its strength as an antioxidant. The fluid inside the eye is normally high in vitamin C, which helps prevents oxidation that clouds the lens. More vitamin C in the diet may increase the amount present in the fluid around the lens, providing extra protection. Researchers noted that the findings only pertain to consuming the nutrient through food and not vitamin supplements.\n\n“The most important finding was that vitamin C intake from food seemed to protect against cataract progression,” said study author Christopher Hammond, M.D., FRCOphth, professor of ophthalmology at King’s College London. “While we cannot totally avoid developing cataracts, we may be able to delay their onset and keep them from worsening significantly by eating a diet rich in vitamin C.” “Genetic and Dietary Factors Influencing the Progression of Nuclear Cataract,” Yonova-Doing, et al.

Now, there is a new solution for people with a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 that want to lose weight called the Orbera gastric balloon.\n\nDr. Prem Chattoo, a New York based gastroenterologist, told FoxNews.com that the balloon is placed it into the stomach through the mouth. It is then inflated with saline during the procedure that lasts about 45 minutes. Patients are treated in office and are kept under mild to moderate sedation. The balloon remains in the patient’s stomach for six months and is then removed the same way it was inserted, through the mouth.\n\n“The beauty of the procedure is that it is a nonsurgical procedure,” Chattoo said. In addition to eliminating the scarring and risks involved with more invasive options, Chattoo said that the recovery time is also much faster.\n\nThe objective of the Orbera system is the make the patient feel partially satiated so they eat smaller, but more nutritious portions. Chattoo also offers patients a nutritionist and trainer with the procedure. The hope is that patients can train their body to eat in a much healthier fashion without feeling overly hungry.\n\nMarie Brown chose to undergo the procedure and credits Orbera for helping her lose over 20 pounds in three and a half months. She told FoxNews.com that the balloon “makes you feel full all the time to the point where you’re not angry about having to lose things like chocolate and cake.”\n\nBrown said that the balloon acted like a “restart button” and retrained her body to adapt to a new lifestyle of healthy eating and exercise.\n\nOrbera is not for the morbidly obese or those who have had surgical procedures affecting the stomach or intestinal lining. It is meant for people looking for an extra jumpstart on a diet, whether the purpose is cosmetic or for health reasons.\n\n“We might be able to prevent young, healthy people from having these chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension,” Chattoo said.\n\nThe most common side effect of installing the balloon is nausea that lasts a few days. Chattoo said that even if the balloon were to pop, the saline would be absorbed and pose no harm to the patient. The balloon would be removed in the same way it is at the six month mark.\n\nOrbera is not covered by insurance and costs $8,000. For more information, click here.\n\n']","Another poorly reported piece from Fox News–this time about a gastric balloon called Orbera–is very light on important details, like whether the device actually works.","This story describes a medical intervention designed to help people lose weight. The intervention, called Orbera, involves placing a balloon in a patient’s stomach via the mouth and then inflating it with saline. This, according to the story, will limit the patient’s hunger, allowing the patient to eat less and still feel full. The balloon is then removed, via the mouth, six months later. However, the story reads more like a paid promotion than a news story. There is no discussion of how well it works (if at all) in either the short-term or long-term, no mention of serious risks, no input from third-party sources.

Chan, PhD, Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, vice chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and senior author of the new study. First approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977 for allergies, the drug has been available over the counter in generic form since 1993.\n\nThe researchers said that the Phase II results, published online on 10 October, 2017 in The Lancet, are the first in which a drug has been shown to reliably restore any brain function damaged by a neurological disease in human patients.\n\n""To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a therapy has been able to reverse deficits caused by MS. It\'s not a cure, but it\'s a first step towards restoring brain function to the millions who are affected by this chronic, debilitating disease,"" said the trial\'s principal investigator, Ari Green, MD, also Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and medical director of the UCSF Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroinflammation Center.\n\nChan and Green are co-directors of the UCSF Small-Molecule Program for Remyelination, and both are members of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.\n\nThe new results are particularly notable, Chan said, because patients in the trial had suffered from MS symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years. ""People thought we were absolutely crazy to launch this trial, because they thought that only in newly diagnosed cases could a drug like this be effective -- intuitively, if myelin damage is new, the chance of repair is strong. In the patients in our trial the disease had gone on for years, but we still saw strong evidence of repair.""\n\nMS is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly 2.5 million people worldwide. The disease strikes when the immune system attacks myelin, layers of fatty insulating membrane that surround nerve fibers. Unlike the rubber insulation around wires, however, myelin helps electrical signals in neurons move faster and more efficiently. As myelin damage continues over the course of the disease, neurons progressively lose their ability to reliably transmit electrical signals, resulting in progressive loss of vision, weakness, walking difficulties, and problems with coordination and balance.\n\nCurrent MS treatments aim to prevent the immune system from doing further harm, but none have been shown to repair damaged myelin. In both his 2013 research and in subsequent studies with a mouse model of MS, however, Chan and colleagues had demonstrated that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin regeneration and restores neural function, promising preclinical results that inspired the new study, known as the ReBUILD trial.\n\nBecause the visual system is often one of the first and most prominent parts of the brain to be affected in MS, and because there are well-established tools to measure the speed of neural transmission in the areas of the brain devoted to vision, the research team used a method known as visual evoked potentials, or VEPs, to assess clemastine\'s therapeutic effects in the trial.\n\nThe five-month Phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally long-standing MS whose VEPs reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission. The researchers showed flickering patterns on a screen to participants, and used electrodes placed over the brain\'s visual areas at the back of the head to gauge how long it took for the flickering signal presented to the eye to generate an electrical response that could be detected by the electrodes. The time from presentation of the pattern to the detection of the VEP is a measurement of how long it took for the signal to travel via nerve fibers from the retina, at the back of the eye, to the visual areas at the back of the brain.\n\nTo enhance the power of their study, the researchers used a ""crossover"" design: they divided the patient population in two and gave the drug, blinded to both participant and researcher, to one group, and a placebo to the other for 90 days; then they switched between the two groups, giving a placebo to the first group and the drug to the other for the next 60 days. This ""flip-flop"" technique gave the researchers the ability to compare patients to themselves -- a form of control that increased the statistical power of the study by nearly an order of magnitude, Green said.\n\nDuring the periods when each group was taking the drug, the neural signal from the eye to the back of the brain was significantly accelerated over the baseline measurements taken before the patients began the study. The effect persisted in the group that had switched to placebo, suggesting that durable repair of myelin had been induced by the drug.\n\nAlthough the research team could not directly observe evidence of rebuilding of myelin in trial participants using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Chan and Green said that this reflects a weakness of current MRI techniques as a tool for this purpose rather than evidence that myelin regeneration did not take place. ""We still don\'t have imaging methods that have been proven to be able to detect remyelination in humans,"" said Chan.\n\nThat myelin increases the speed of neural transmission is one of the most well-established concepts in neurobiology, and combined with the clear evidence from Chan\'s preclinical research showing that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin formation, myelin regeneration is the only plausible explanation for the VEP results, the authors said.\n\n""This is the first step in a long process,"" Green said. ""By no means do we want to suggest that this is a cure-all. We want to ground-truth myelination metrics -- we\'re designing the crucible that\'s going to be used to test any future method for detecting remyelination.""\n\n###\n\nThe work was funded through generous support from the Rachleff Family.\n\nIn addition to Green and Chan, authors (all at UCSF) include Jeffrey M Gelfand, MD, MAS; Bruce A Cree, MD, PhD, MAS; Carolyn Bevan, MD; W. John Boscardin, PhD; Feng Mei, PhD; Justin Inman; Sam Arnow; Michael Devereux; Aya Abounasr; Hiroko Nobuta, PhD; Alyssa Zhu; Matt Friessen, PhD; Roy Gerona, PhD; Hans Christian von Büdingen, MD, PhD; Roland G Henry, PhD; and Stephen L Hauser, MD.\n\nUC San Francisco (UCSF) is a leading university dedicated to promoting health worldwide through advanced biomedical research, graduate-level education in the life sciences and health professions, and excellence in patient care.

Approved by FDA in 1977 for allergies, the generic form of this drug has been available over the counter since 1993.
The study found that the drug improved results on a test of function in a nerve pathway in the visual system, which is usually damaged in MS. These test results indicated that myelin had been repaired, a first for MS treatment. This is encouraging, although no effect on actual symptoms was shown in this small, short-term trial.
UCSF’s release does a thorough job explaining the disease mechanism of MS, especially in clarifying how nerve degeneration through the progressive damage of myelin leads to symptoms like loss of vision and coordination problems. The release also gives a thorough, clear description of the study design, including an easy-to-understand illustration of what a “crossover” trial is.
Costs are not discussed in this news release, but it’s a hot topic in the MS community, since current drug therapies amount to tens of thousands of dollars per year. Clemastine as a generic, “older” drug would provide a much welcome cheaper alternative.
Overall, we feel this release was well written and informative, leaving readers with a good sense of what was uncovered in this study and why the findings are important.

Such conclusions have been well examined in the general population, where a recommended exercise program of 30 minutes at least five days a week (or 150 minutes per week) has been shown to reduce the average risk of death by 30 percent.\n\nHowever, such a correlation between the level of physical activity and risk of death has not been so clearly determined in the elderly. Indeed, most physical activity guidelines are the same for the middle-aged adults as for the elderly, even though it is estimated that over 60% of the elderly are unable to achieve this same level of exercise.\n\nNow, a study in a French cohort of more than 1000 elderly subjects (the PROOF study) has found a negative correlation between their level of physical activity and risk of all-cause death, suggesting that in the elderly (as in other population groups) the risk of death decreases with greater and more regular exercise.\n\nThe results of the study are presented today at EuroPRevent 2015 by Dr David Hupin from the Department of Clinical and Exercise Physiology at the University Hospital of St-Etienne-Lyon, France.1\n\nSubjects were enrolled in the study at age 65 in 2001 and followed-up for 13 years. During that follow-up their level of physical activity was monitored and categorised according to five levels of MET-h values per week: <1; 1-3.74; 3-75-7.49 (equivalent to brisk walking for up to 150 minutes per week, and the recommended activity level); 7.5-15; and >15 MET-h per week.2 Mortality and cardiovascular events were recorded over the follow-up period and associated with exercise levels.\n\nResults showed that around 10% of the eligible cohort died during the follow-up period. However, the risk of death was calculated to be 57% lower in those whose activity level was equal to or higher than the recommended 150 minutes per week (7.5-15 MET-h per week). And furthermore, those doing a very low level of physical activity per week (1-3.74 MET-h/week) had 51% lower risk of death than those doing the very minimum (<1 MET-h/week). These differences in risk were statistically significant.\n\nThere were other significant findings too - notably that starting or restarting physical activity during retirement reduced the risk of death by two-thirds, but in contrast any reduction, even in low levels of activity, exposed the elderly to a higher risk of death.\n\nIn commenting on the results, Dr Hupin said several conclusions might be drawn but notably that the level of physical activity in the elderly was negatively associated with mortality rate in a ""dose-dependent"" way and that even a low level of exercise below current recommendations had some protective effect.\n\nAs a simple rule for the elderly Dr Hupin recommended that at least 15 minutes of physical activity for five days a week would be a suitable first target for the elderly. ""This could include brisk walking, cycling, swimming or gymnastics,"" he suggested, ""all possibly associated with leisure time physical activity or daily life activities.""\n\nDr Hupin emphasised that the widespread acceptance of this message would encourage more elderly people to include even ""low doses"" of physical activity in their usual daily activities, without experiencing high levels of fatigue or of pain. ""This message should be relayed by general practitioners, who play a key and essential role in promoting exercise behaviour in the elderly,"" he said. ""Even a little is good, and more may be better.""\n\nThe findings from this PROOF study were confirmed in a meta-analysis preformed by the same group and reported at this same EuroPRevent congress.3 This analysis, drawing on data involving almost 120,000 subjects, found that ""low-dose"" moderate-to-vigorous physical activity - of, say, 75 minutes per week or 15 minutes per day - significantly reduced mortality in the elderly. Based on the results, Dr Hupin said that a revision of the recommendations for physical activity in the elderly may thus be warranted and beneficial - low dose physical activity can significantly reduce mortality. In this meta-analysis a low dose of activity resulted in a mortality rate reduction of 22%.\n\n###\n\nDid you want to tweet about our congress? - if you do, please use the official #Europrevent hashtag!

Presented at EuroPRevent 2015, Lisbon.\n\n2. METs, or metabolic equivalents, are a measure of physiological measure expressing the energy cost of physical activities. One MET is defined as a rate of oxygen consumption of 3.5 ml/kg/min in adults, which is the rate of oxygen expended at rest. Different activities have been associated with different MET intensity. The MET ""dose"" is determined by three components of physical activity: intensity (MET), duration (hour) and frequency (per week).\n\n3. Hupin D, Roche F, Gremeaux, et al. Low-dose physical activity reduces mortality in the elderly. A systematic review and meta-analysis. Presented at EuroPRevent 2015, Lisbon.\n\nAbout EuroPRevent\n\nEuroPRevent 2015, the world\'s leading congress in preventive cardiology, is organised by the European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (EACPR), an association of the European Society of Cardiology, from 14 to 16 May in Lisbon.\n\nAbout the European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention & Rehabilitation (EACPR)\n\nThe European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention & Rehabilitation (EACPR) is a registered branch of the ESC. Its aim is to promote excellence in research, practice, education and policy in cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation in Europe.\n\nAbout the European Society of Cardiology\n\nThe European Society of Cardiology (ESC) represents more than 80 000 cardiology professionals across Europe and the Mediterranean. Its mission is to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in Europe.\n\nInformation for journalists attending EuroPRevent 2015']",We’ve called out ,"This news release from a conference put on by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) describes a moderately-sized cohort study that followed elderly people aged 65 and over for 13 years, focusing on the correlation between the level of physical activity and risk of death. Although the release does a thorough job explaining what the researchers did in this study, it inflates the benefits data by reporting figures in terms of relative risk reduction. In addition, it’s unclear what this study brings to the existing scientific knowledge on aging and physical activity, since we found other published research studying this link that’s not mentioned.
But the biggest deficiency is the release’s failure to point out any of the study’s potential biases or limitations. And that’s the very same problem that has already gotten the ESC nominated to our News Release Wall of Shame in the past. The study looked at a group of elderly people, many of whom are likely to have health problems (perhaps unrecognized health problems) that affect both their risk of death and their ability to exercise. Trying to isolate the effects of physical activity in such a group is a very tricky proposition, but the release never expresses so much as a hint of doubt regarding the findings. While we agree that exercise at any age is likely to be beneficial, we think researchers and communications professionals should provide a balanced view of a study’s strengths and limitations in their news releases. Otherwise, news coverage of the study will also reflect a lopsided view of the findings.

What\'s more, the drug carries a risk of bone damage, stunted growth and heart trouble, and can render children impotent.\n\nThese experts contend that Lupron, costing about $5,000 a month but seldom covered by insurance, is one of many treatments that cash in on the desperation of parents trying to cope with an incurable condition for which medicine has few good answers outside of painstaking behavioral therapy.\n\n""Not only is there no scientific backing whatsoever for Lupron treatments, there are several major concerns for the children\'s health,"" said neurologist BethAnn McLaughlin, an adviser to the Dan Marino Foundation autism group in Weston and the mother of two developmentally disabled children.\n\n""These people are preying on the fears of parents. We cannot be using these children who are so vulnerable as guinea pigs in a medical experiment.""\n\nUntested autism treatments have flourished while science struggles to explain the disorder, which disrupts the abilities to speak, concentrate, connect with people and control impulses.\n\nFor unknown reasons, autism has been on the rise for the past few decades, with an estimated 675,000 children – about one in 100 – now having mild to severe symptoms. Scientists believe it stems from genetic defects that may only cause problems after an environmental trigger.\n\nA vocal subset of parents and activists blame vaccines, especially those with the mercury-based preservative thimerosal, which has been banned from virtually all as a precaution. Numerous studies have found no connection between autism and vaccines or thimerosal.\n\nLupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Baltimore researcher Dr. Mark Geier started using the drug in 2005 on the theory – disputed by mainsteam doctors – that testosterone binds mercury in the body and that many autistic kids have high levels of the hormone.\n\nLupron halts production of the female hormone estrogen, which the body uses to make testosterone. The drug mainly is used to treat endometrial cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, and sometimes to chemically castrate sex offenders.\n\nGeier\'s promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. In his latest, he teams with Dr. David Clayman, a Boca Raton radiologist who has an autistic teen son and is opening an ASD office beside his MRI center in Tamarac.\n\nClayman said he would not comment until he treats patients with Lupron therapy for a year. Geier could not be reached for comment despite several attempts by phone. He told one parent he did not plan to comment for this story.\n\nThe medical group began recruiting Florida patients in March when Geier spoke at a Fort Lauderdale conference for parents of children with autism.\n\nTeresa Badillo was at the meeting. Her family has searched in vain for a way to help their autistic son, Marco, 18. Badillo said he has little speech or interaction with others, but is doing OK in high school. Lately, though, Marco has grown more aggressive, physical and rebellious.\n\n""We were basically under seige in this house,"" Badillo said. ""This kind of behavior is more scary at 18 [than] at 3. I had choices to make. If you see there is another option out there that can help your child, most parents are going to choose that option.""\n\nAlso, Marco had discovered sex and sometimes touched himself inappropriately in public, a common problem among those with autism.\n\n""The kids don\'t understand. They have impulses. It\'s what happens when you have high testosterone,"" Badillo said.\n\nThe family put Marco on Lupron about six weeks ago. He gets two injections a month at a dosage larger than used on adult cancer patients, plus a small daily shot.\n\n""The therapy immediately stopped the aggression,"" Badillo said. ""This is not castrating a kid. It\'s just lowering the [testosterone] levels enough to normal range so the kid is not aggressive.""\n\nShe said Geier plans to continue the Lupron for several months to see if it helps Marco\'s other autistic behavior. She said she knows the drug has risks but believes Lupron critics do not fully grasp the hard realities of life with an autistic child.\n\nLupron critics said autism parents may not understand the dangers.\n\nThe drug is not approved for children – except a rare few with premature puberty – because it can impair bone development crucial to growth, said Dr. Gary Berkovitz, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of Miami medical school.\n\nIt\'s not recommended for people with heart disease, kidney disease, asthma, depression or seizures because it can worsen those conditions. Autistic children are prone to seizures.\n\n""It has not been tested so there\'s no way to know if it has adverse effects in the long run,"" Berkovitz said.\n\nSaid neurologist McLaughlin: ""We have very significant concerns about irreversible damage to sexual function and the brain and sex organs of these children.""\n\nIn addition, the Food and Drug Administration is investigating complaints that Lupron causes diabetes in adults.\n\nGeier published a 2006 study contending that 11 autistic children taking Lupron did better on tests of awareness, sociability and behavior. He has since issued other studies finding that mercury leads to excess testosterone and that autistic children have excessive levels of the hormone.\n\nOther doctors said Geier\'s studies were small, were not scientifically sound and were published in journals that do not follow the standard practice of having experts review the methods.\n\nThe area\'s largest autism treatment center jointly run by the University of Miami and Nova Southeastern University, as well as another at Florida Atlantic University, frown on Lupron and other untested therapies, officials at the centers said.']","Here’s a well-deserved five-star rating for an important piece of public service, hard-nosed, evaluate-the-evidence health care journalism.

These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.\n\nFailing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.\n\nThe United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nOnly 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.\n\n""This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,"" said lead author Dr. Matthew O\'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we\'re proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.""\n\nThe study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O\'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\n\nThe USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group\'s most recent diabetes screening guideline.\n\nIntensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.\n\n""The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,"" O\'Brien said.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O\'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.\n\nAsians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.\n\nThe study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O\'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.\n\n""This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,"" O\'Brien said.\n\nThe study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. It builds on findings from a previous study O\'Brien conducted that incorporated electronic health record data from 50,515 adult primary care patients at community health centers in the Midwest and Southwest between 2008 and 2013.\n\n###\n\nOther Northwestern authors are senior author Dr. Ronald Ackermann and co-authors Mercedes Carnethon and Dr. Namratha Kandula. The other co-authors were from the CDC. Dr. Ronald Ackermann is the study\'s senior author.\n\nThe study was funded by grants R21-DK112066, R01-HL093009 and ULI-TR001422 from the National Center for Health Statistics of the National Institute of Health.']",This release challenges one set of recommendations for who should be screened for “prediabetes” and type 2 diabetes but doesn’t offer strong evidence to make its claim that expanded screening is the answer.,"This news release analyzes results from a study comparing two approaches to screening for diabetes in order to compare their test characteristics, basically the true versus false positives.
The release is light on data supporting its claims that screening guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) pick up too few people when they recommend physicians screen patients that are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. The Northwestern release suggests these guidelines miss African-Americans and Latinos since they tend to develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages. But it’s also possible that the USPSTF recommendations are already too expansive and catch far too many people under the “dysglycemia” label — a broad term including both “prediabetes” and type 2 diabetes — and therefore harm many who end up being medically diagnosed, labeled and “treated” for a condition that may never go on to hurt them.  We can’t lose sight of the fact that high blood sugars is a surrogate marker, the modification of which may never have any clinical benefits, and in fact could be harmful. Maybe the “dysglycemic” term batches together almost everyone on the planet who could, by definition, either be prediabetic or diabetic, which is most of us.

The device is approved only for dermatologists and only for use on growths that don\'t have obvious signs of cancer but still have one or two worrisome traits.\n\nThe hope is to find more melanomas sooner. Nearly all patients diagnosed with early-stage melanoma can be treated and cured, but 85 percent of patients with late-stage melanoma die from it within five years.\n\nMore than 70,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with melanoma this year, and 16 percent are diagnosed only after the disease has spread to other parts of the body, according to estimates from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nTo diagnose the disease, doctors decide which moles to remove and biopsy using an entirely visual set of guidelines involving size, shape and color. Most dermatologists easily spot late-stage lesions that have obvious signs of cancer, including irregular edges, uneven color and a width greater than 6 millimeters. But many others are tough calls.\n\n""Every day patients come in with 20 moles on their back and the dilemma is, which ones are suspicious and need to be biopsied?"" said Dr. David Pariser, former president of the American Academy of Dermatology. ""The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it,"" said Pariser, who consulted for the device\'s maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA.\n\nThe device\'s handheld attachment, about the size of a blow dryer, emits light that penetrates below the surface of the skin, taking multicolored images that reflect the depth and shape of skin growths. A computer compares these to a database of 10,000 archived images and recommends whether a biopsy should be done.\n\nIn a company-sponsored study published last year involving around 1,300 patients, some with multiple growths, doctors reported that MelaFind correctly suggested biopsies on 125 of 127 melanomas that doctors had removed. MelaFind correctly identified about 10 percent of non-cancerous growths, which was better than doctors in the study who were correct less than 4 percent of the time, on average. The study was published in the Archives of Dermatology.\n\nThe company\'s study was not intended to show that screening with the device saves lives, only that it can help improve a doctor\'s ability to spot melanoma.\n\nFor now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove.\n\n""There is no such thing as 100 percent certainty in medicine,"" said Dr. George Elias, a melanoma expert at Georgetown\'s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center who had no ties to the company or the device.\n\n""Ultimately it\'s the responsibility of the dermatologist to use his clinical judgment to make the best decision. This machine is there to help him, not replace him.""\n\nElias voted with the majority of an FDA panel that narrowly endorsed the device last year.\n\nDermatologists say it\'s too early to tell whether MelaFind will lead to fewer unnecessary biopsies.\n\n""A biopsy takes a few minutes in my hands, so if there\'s an issue with any lesion we will always biopsy, whether we have a MelaFind picture or not,"" said Dr. Leonard Goldberg, a dermatologist at the Texas Medical Center and vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, a disease awareness group that accepts donations from makers of sunscreen.\n\nMelaFind underwent a contentious, years-long review by the Food and Drug Administration, which initially rejected the device and concluded it could ""potentially cause more harm than good.""\n\nRegulators worried that the device could give physicians a false sense of certainty, leading to fewer biopsies. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device\'s feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. About 8 percent of growths scanned in the company study came back as ""unevaluable.""\n\nAt a meeting last fall, FDA scientists said Mela Sciences had not shown how its device would influence day-to-day decisions by doctors. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles. Despite these concerns, the panel of advisers narrowly backed the overall safety and efficacy of the device in a 8-7 vote.\n\nRegulators said this week that they ultimately approved the device after Mela Sciences agreed to limit its use to board-certified dermatologists who undergo a specialized training course.\n\n""The device is only good for certain lesions, and that\'s why you have to be a dermatologist to be able to classify and categorize those lesions appropriately,"" said Christy Foreman, director of FDA\'s Office of Device Evaluation.\n\nForeman said an FDA-required follow-up study would help determine how much of a benefit MelaFind represents for patients.\n\n""This device represents new technology. At the end of the day I don\'t know that this will be the best technology out there, but it is a step forward to allow continued innovation in this area,"" Foreman said.\n\nDon\'t expect to see a MelaFind machine at your next doctor\'s appointment. The company plans to bring them next year to just 200 dermatologists on the East coast, all of whom must undergo company training before they can begin using the device.\n\nDoctors will pay a one-time fee of $7,500 to lease and receive training on the device. Patients will pay $150 out of pocket for a MelaFind scan, which analysts say may limit use to more affluent patients who are willing to pay extra for the latest medical care. Mela Sciences does not plan to ask insurers to cover the device until several years from now, after it is more widely used.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This nicely written, thoroughly reported piece by the Associated Press is a very good example of how to report on new medical devices.</span>","It puts both the potential benefits and potential harms of this scanner used to detect cancerous skin lesions in the proper context. It explains that, while new to the market, the device is not a medical breakthrough. It provides cost information, for both the physicians and patients.

Atherosclerotic disease, in which plaque buildup narrows the brain arteries, is one of the most common causes of strokes.\n\nNeurosurgeons performing EDAS reroute arteries from the scalp and the membranes that cover the brain and place these arteries under the skull near areas of the brain at risk of stroke. Over time, new blood vessels form, creating fresh pathways for blood and oxygen to reach the brain.\n\nThe trial, led by Nestor R. Gonzalez, MD, professor of Neurosurgery and director of the Neurovascular Laboratory at Cedars-Sinai, enrolled 52 patients with severe brain atherosclerosis, also known as intracranial atherosclerotic disease, or ICAD, who showed symptoms of either a recent stroke or a mini-stroke, called a transient ischemic attack. These patients received EDAS surgery, along with intensive medical management, which included diet and lifestyle changes, blood thinners and other medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.\n\nAfter one year, 9.6 percent of the patients treated with the surgery experienced another ischemic stroke or died, compared with 21.2 percent of patients in a matched control group who received only intensive medical management. Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported.\n\n""Our findings in this intermediate-stage trial are promising for applying EDAS surgery to intracranial atherosclerotic disease,"" said Gonzalez said. Previously, EDAS has been used for moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disorder that affects younger patients.\n\nGonzalez said the new trial addressed a serious medical need. ""Even under the best current treatments, ICAD carries high rates of recurrent stroke and death, compared with other causes of stroke,"" he said. ""Developing new therapeutic strategies is crucial for ICAD patients.""\n\nCurrent ICAD therapies--in addition to intensive medical management--include bypass surgery to connect a blood vessel from outside the brain to a vessel inside the brain, as well as angioplasty with stenting, which involves inflating a tiny balloon inside a cerebral artery to open it up and placing a stent device inside the artery. Despite advances in medical care, annual rates of recurrent stroke and death are remain high, at 15 percent or more for ICAD patients, according to published research.\n\nGonzalez said his team is working with the stroke prevention working group of the National Institutes of Health to develop a proposal for a Phase III randomized clinical trial across multiple institutions to further test the effectiveness of EDAS as compared with intensive medical management. While this Phase IIa trial selected patients from previous studies as the control group, the Phase III study would enroll new ICAD patients for both the control and experimental groups, he explained.\n\n""This clinical trial moves us significantly closer to preventing strokes and death in high-risk populations,"" said Keith Black, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery. ""As a nationally renowned physician-investigator, Dr. Gonzalez personifies the dedication of Cedars-Sinai to translating the most advanced research into new cures.""\n\n###\n\nBesides Gonzalez, the trial involved other investigators from the stroke centers of Cedars-Sinai and UCLA.\n\nFunding: Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Strokes of the National Institutes of Health under award number K23NS079477-01A1.']",The study results do not establish that the surgery was more effective than medical management as claimed in the news release.,"This release from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center describes a phase 2 clinical trial that looked at whether an existing surgical procedure could be used to reduce the rate of recurrent strokes or death among patients with severe brain artery blockages.
It gives a numerical comparison between those benefiting from the surgery and those who only received “intensive medical management.”  And the researchers state that those results show that the procedure — encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) — “significantly decreases the rate of stroke recurrence and death.” However, the difference between these groups for the main outcome of the study was not statistically significant — which should have been clearly disclosed and which contradicts the stated claim that the surgery is more effective.

Our new test is therefore a potential game changer,"" says Professor James Paton, Director of the University of Adelaide\'s Research Centre for Infectious Diseases.\n\nProfessor Michael Jennings, Deputy Director of the Institute for Glycomics at Griffith University, said: ""Detection of this tumour marker may also play a role in a simple liquid biopsy to monitor disease stage and treatment.""\n\nThe team is currently seeking scientific and commercial partners to further test the technology with larger numbers of patient samples and to adapt it for mass screening.\n\n###']",This news release is far too rosy about the potential and far too limited about the remaining uncertainties.,"The news release highlights this recent study of a commercially unavailable blood test to detect ovarian cancer. The study is quite small and explores whether the test detects cancer in women already known to have it. The results are too preliminary to conclude whether or not this experimental method could reliably detect cancer in large numbers of women whose cancer status is unknown.
This is key information for readers and should have been made much more clear.
The news release does well in establishing the scope and diagnostic challenges of ovarian cancer, but falls quite short in letting readers know that most of the authors — two of whom offer quite optimistic quotes — are inventors of the test with pending patents.

And other studies already underway may soon offer patients even more options, researchers say.\n\nPatients taking Folfirinox, a novel combination of four drugs already approved to fight other cancers, lived 11.1 months — 4.3 months longer than those given standard chemo, according to a French study of 342 patients in today\'s New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThat might not seem like a lot of time in any other disease.\n\nBut study author Thierry Conroy notes that pancreatic cancer is especially lethal, typically killing patients in only about 6 months.

The kids also missed fewer days of school and were less likely to need medical care.\n\nHowever, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results.\n\n""The decision about whether those children should have tonsillectomy for that temporary benefit is really tied to what those children need or what they\'re suffering with,"" Chinnadurai said. Kids who miss a lot of school or need frequent trips to the doctor due to sore throats could benefit from the surgery, he said.\n\nThere\'s an even clearer benefit for kids whose sleep is disturbed due to inflamed tonsils, Chinnadurai said.\n\n""In a child with a diagnosis of sleep apnea, we can see a benefit in sleep-related quality of life,"" he said. The kids get better sleep, and thus exhibit better everyday behavior and pay more attention in school.\n\nThe medical approach to treating tonsil infections has evolved over recent decades.\n\nTonsillectomy is the third most common surgery performed on U.S. children, with 530,000 such procedures completed each year, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nThirty years ago, nine out of 10 tonsillectomies in children were performed to treat recurring throat infections. These days, the procedure is done 20 percent of the time for infections and 80 percent of the time for sleep problems, according to the academy.\n\nSwollen tonsils can block the airway during sleep, causing breathing problems that range from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the researchers said in background notes.\n\nGuidelines say a tonsillectomy to treat throat infections is justified if a child had seven or more sore throats during the previous year; five or more sore throats two years running, or three or more sore throats for three years in a row, according to the background notes.\n\nThe researchers decided to review whether the throat infection guidelines are too stringent, ruling out patients who potentially could benefit but don\'t meet the high threshold of recurring infections, Chinnadurai said.\n\nThere aren\'t strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation.\n\nThe study results showed ""there may be new evidence that supports expanding the criteria and opening up the procedure to more individuals,"" said Dr. Alyssa Hackett, an otolaryngologist with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n""In the right child with the right indications, these are really wonderful procedures that can be life-changing for both the child and the family,"" said Hackett, who wasn\'t involved with the new research.\n\n""If you need your appendix out, you need your appendix out,"" Hackett said. ""But for the tonsils and adenoids, there are great quality-of-life benefits that are evident for the surgery, but no child has ever died because they haven\'t gone through the surgery."" (Adenoids, glands at the roof of the mouth, are often removed along with tonsils.)\n\nStill, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.\n\nAbout 3 percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two-week recovery period, Hackett said.\n\n""Though a tonsillectomy is low-risk, it is not risk-free, and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child,"" Chinnadurai said.\n\n""We\'re talking about a child who has significant sleep-related issues,"" Hackett said. ""We don\'t want people to say my child snores, they need to have their tonsils out. That\'s not what this study says at all.""\n\nThe two reports were published online Jan. 17 in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on tonsillectomy, visit the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.']",The studies say that the medical literature is weak on a definitive answer that applies to all kids and that the proper approach depends on the individual.,"This story is based on two papers published in the journal Pediatrics (here and here) which were meta-analyses of studies in the medical literature about the success of tonsillectomies in reducing throat infections and in improving obstructed breathing while asleep.
The story includes a very good snapshot of how frequently tonsillectomies are performed today, and how that compares with 30 years ago. The article also includes prospective from an outside source on the implications of the new studies.
But the story characterizes the study results as promoting a change in tonsillectomy guidelines, rather than simply reporting on the findings of the analyses. One of the studies suggests that any improvement in throat infections is limited to only the first year following surgery, and that short-term benefit is noted in the article.
The story doesn’t mention costs and only briefly mentions the risks associated with this procedure. And while the studies are extremely careful in characterizing their findings, this story isn’t and generalizes the conclusions to the detriment of the readers.

1656,story_reviews_01054,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/4090/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,Study Questions Chiropractic’s Impact on Back Pain,"['By Maureen Salamon\n\nHealthDay Reporter\n\nWEDNESDAY, July 6, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- For the millions of Americans with chronic low back pain, a silver bullet to alleviate the condition has yet to be identified, a new study suggests.\n\nReviewing 26 studies comparing spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) to other treatments such as medication, exercise or physical therapy, researchers from the Netherlands found that SMT appears to be no better or worse than other options at relieving back pain long-term.\n\nThe analyses indicated that SMT -- which involves manual manipulation of the spine and surrounding muscles -- has only a short-term impact on pain relief, although it eases pain faster than other treatments.\n\n""In short, no single therapy is better than another, although some individuals are likely to have more success with one therapy than another,"" said study author Sidney Rubinstein, a research fellow at VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam.\n\n""Current studies are focusing on which subjects are more likely to benefit from spinal manipulation, exercise, or other therapies,"" he added. ""Spinal manipulation should be considered a viable treatment option for those with non-specific, chronic low back pain.""\n\nThe study was recently published in the journal Spine.\n\nMore than 6,000 patients were included in the compilation of results, which the study authors said were sparse in data indicating participants\' overall recovery, quality of life and ability to return to work. The studies also varied in quality, with only nine of 26 considered ""low [in] bias,"" according to background information accompanying the study.\n\nIn all evaluations, patients were randomly assigned to SMT or another comparison treatment, including active treatments such as exercise or inactive placebo treatments.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the studies were not included in a previous review published in 2004, and all patients had suffered from lower back pain for 12 weeks or longer.\n\nWhile chiropractors often perform SMT on patients, it is also administered by physical therapists and osteopaths. But which treatment is right for any patient depends not only on their specific pain, but their doctor\'s recommendations and their own comfort level with various options, said Stephen Perle, a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Association.\n\nThe cost of SMT sessions varies widely depending on the region, Perle said.\n\n""Nobody has the answer at this time,"" Perle said. ""I guess people in almost every profession like to say, \'We have a compelling treatment and it will work almost every time,\' but that\'s just not the case.""\n\n""With low back pain, there are many reasons people don\'t get better,"" added Perle, also a professor of clinical sciences in the College of Chiropractic at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut. ""So the finding was not unexpected.""\n\nAn unrelated study of 401 patients with low back pain, published July 5 in Annals of Internal Medicine, suggested that massage may be better than medication or exercise for short-term pain relief.\n\nSeattle researchers found that those who received either relaxation massage or structural massage, which involved manipulation of muscles and ligaments, had less pain and better functioning for up to a year compared to those getting ""usual medical care,"" which included medication and physical therapy.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more information about low back pain.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story touched on an important truth about the treatment of chronic back pain—even if it missed some key points along the way. </span>","
The article focused on a recent systematic review of the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain.  The Cochrane Collaboration review found that this popular treatment leads to rapid short-term pain relief and improvement in function.
But the magnitude of the treatment effect was modest at best. And manipulation did not provide a “clinically significant” advantage over other common treatments for chronic low back pain, according to this review.
The HealthDay article made a key observation about chronic back pain: that there is no “silver bullet” for it. And it provided a brief but fair description of the systematic review and the evidence it considered.  Our reviewers could have gone either way on several of the graded criteria, so the 4-star final score may be a bit deceiving.
What were some of the shortcomings of this article? The article had a misleading title: “Study Questions Chiropractic’s Impact on Back Pain”.
This systematic review looked at the effects of manipulation as practiced by multiple professions rather than the impact of chiropractic per se. Since the review concluded that manipulation is a viable treatment for chronic back pain, one can argue that it supports rather than questions this manual therapy.
It might have been useful to ask an impartial expert how the new review on manipulation compares with other recent reviews of the evidence in this area. And how manipulation compares with other effective treatments for chronic back pain.
Readers of this article might well have come away with the impression that all treatments for chronic back pain offer similar results. This is not the case.
Of the 200 or so therapies for chronic back pain in the medical marketplace, no treatment consistently offers a major benefit. Only a few have been proven to provide a moderate benefit for chronic back pain.
The most influential U.S. guideline found only six treatments, including manipulation, where there was “good” evidence of a “moderate benefit” for chronic back pain (See Chou et al., 2007; Chou et al., 2009).
An influential British review concluded that three general approaches (exercise, manual therapy including manipulation, and acupuncture) provide roughly equal benefit in the early management of persistent back pain. (See NICE, 2009).
So the new review on manipulation is reasonably consistent with the larger evidence picture.
It would have been useful if the article could have highlighted this point—since it offers an important message for people with chronic back pain. Based on this body of evidence, they shouldn’t be expecting heroic cures. Rather, they should look for validated treatments that can help them stay comfortable and active—and that align with their values, expectations and tolerance for risk.

To supply the restaurant, he started an organic vegetable farm in Whately, in the fertile soil of the Connecticut River Valley. Because he grew a lot of vegetables, he started an organic produce trucking and distribution business. Then followed an immense commercial sprout business.\n\nBy 1985, the Chinese entrepreneur was casting about for new commercial crops to grow that would impart both food value and medicinal benefits. In conversations with his friend Dr. Shiu Hu of Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, Chang became enamored of growing schisandra, a berry highly prized in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for its purported longevity promoting powers. Hu provided Chang with the fist seeds for this venture, which he planted at his Whately farm.\n\nToday, Pioneer Valley Schisandra cultivates over fifty acres of U.S.D.A. Certified Organic Schisandra berries. The farm has been producing berries since the early 1990’s, and representatives from a number of giant multi-national corporations have driven out to the foothills of the Berkshires to kick tires and contemplate what they might do with a whole lot of schisandra berry.\n\nAt the farm during harvest, a number of Latinos work the berry bushes, which are set up on fenced wires, like the French espalier method of growing. The berries ripen inconsistently, so harvesters will make a few passes through the orchard during harvest season. Chang designed this way of cultivating schisandra, and actually went back to China to teach this method to growers there in China’s northern Liaoning Province. I visited that region in 2009 for the harvest, and saw that by that time, Chang’s method was commonly used everywhere.\n\nAt age 87, the clock is ticking for the fulfillment of Chang’s mission, but he seems to be in the right spot for this. Schisandra chinensis has been used in TCM for over 2,000 years. Schisandra is still relatively unknown in the U.S. market. But due to its age-old use for enhancing vitality and its strong science base, the berry and its preparations should get a good market boost in the years ahead.\n\nThe berry of schisandra owes its name Wu Wei Zi (five flavored berry) to the fact that it is sweet, sour, salty, bitter and pungent. Schisandra chinensis enjoys millennia of traditional use for prolong life, retarding the aging process, increasing energy, as a fatigue-fighter, and as a sexual tonic. Schisandra also possesses significant protective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. It is considered one of the most highly protective of all medicinal plants, and the berry is included in many traditional herbal formulas for improving energy and mental health.\n\nThe activity of the berry appears due primarily to its concentration of two groups of novel compounds, known respectively as schizandrins and gomasins. These agents are lignans, and are extensively well studied for internal and topical benefits.\n\nSchisandra counters stress by reducing the levels of stress hormones in the blood. Additionally, schisandra offers great benefits for athletes. In human studies the berry and its extracts have improved performance among long distance runners, skiers and gymnasts. For this reason schisandra berry is often found on the training tables of Chinese athletes.\n\nSchisandra also offers special benefits for the mind. Several human studies show that schisandra extract improves concentration, coordination and endurance. Schisandra helps to prevent mental fatigue and increases accuracy and quality of work. In various human clinical studies with doctors, students, soldiers and other groups, schisandra demonstrated superior mind-sharpening powers.\n\nAs if all these benefits were insufficient, schisandra also offers first-rate liver-protective benefits. Schisandra helps in the treatment of hepatitis, as noted in over 500 cases. In fact, an antihepatitis drug was developed from Schizadrin C.\n\nStanding outside in the early fall sun, admiring healthy schisandra bushes, it’s hard not not be impressed by the size and scope of Chang’s farm, and by his long-time commitment to this berry and its future. When Hippocrates advised to let your food be your medicine, he could easily have been referring to schisandra, whose time in the sun must surely come.\n\nChris Kilham is a medicine hunter who researches natural remedies all over the world, from the Amazon to Siberia.

Although it has been on the market since 2006, Deplin is generating growing buzz at psychiatric conferences and among clinicians and patients, particularly those who haven\'t responded to antidepressants or did for a while only to have their depression return.\n\n""Many of the patients I put on Deplin come back and say, \'Wow, my medication is working again\' or \'Hey, doc, this medicine never worked this well before,\' "" says psychiatrist Thor Bergersen, who practices in Needham, Mass., and New York City.\n\nIt\'s long been known that folate—found naturally in green, leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and some fruits—is important for cell growth and brain function. How and why is now becoming clearer. Recent research has found that the body converts folate (and folic acid, the synthetic version) into an active form called L-methylfolate, which is needed to produce serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, three neurotransmitters that are critical in regulating mood.\n\nTrial and Error For many patients, treating depression involves trying multiple drugs over a long period of time. • Nearly 20 million people in the U.S. suffer depression during their lifetime. •11% of Americans over age 12 take antidepressants. • Only 30% get well on the first antidepressant alone. • Up to 50% of patients never reach remission. • People with low folate levels are six times as likely to fail to respond to antidepressants as those with normal levels. Sources: CDC; NIMH; Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology\n\nAging, illness, genetics, poor nutrition, excess alcohol consumption and some medications can all reduce L-methylfolate levels, leaving those neurotransmitters in short supply, some researchers say. While many popular antidepressants slow the ""reuptake"" of serotonin or norepinephrine, making them available longer to the brain, such drugs may not work for long or at all if the brain isn\'t producing sufficient quantities of the neurotransmitters in the first place, some experts theorize.\n\n""This is a totally new way to look at depression. We may be getting at the very foundation of why many people never achieve a full remission,"" says John Zajecka, director of the Depression Treatment & Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Dr. Zajecka has helped investigate Deplin and is on the speakers bureau for its maker, Pamlab LLC, of Covington, La.\n\nPamlab officials say that Deplin, which contains L-methylfolate, can directly supply what some people need to make sufficient quantities of neurotransmitters that regulate mood. And it does so more efficiently than taking extra folic acid, which still needs to be converted, they say.\n\nAs convincing as that sounds, clinical evidence is limited. Pamlab, which currently has the market to itself, sells Deplin as a ""medical food,"" a category that isn\'t held to the same standards the Food and Drug Administration demands of new drugs. Medical foods are intended to provide dietary management for a disease or condition; all ingredients must be ""generally recognized as safe"" and physician supervision is required.\n\nNearly 30,000 clinicians have prescribed Deplin in the past three years, according to Pamlab, and monthly prescriptions grew 31% to nearly 39,000 in October from January 2011. Still, that\'s a tiny fraction of the more than 20 million prescriptions for antidepressants every month in the U.S.\n\nJust two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated Deplin, with a total of 223 subjects. Both were supported by Pamlab. In one study, presented at the American Psychiatric Association\'s meeting in May, 75 depressed patients were randomly assigned to take either 15 milligrams of Deplin or a placebo along with an antidepressant. After 30 days, 32% of subjects on Deplin had responded, compared with 15% on the placebo. However, an earlier study using a lower dose of Deplin found no difference with a placebo. Subjects reported no more side effects with Deplin than with the placebo in either trial.\n\nAbout Folate • Folate, a B vitamin found naturally in some foods, is needed to maintain cell growth and brain function. Deficiencies are associated with depression, certain types of anemia and birth defects. Poor diet, aging, illness, alcoholism and some medications can lower folate levels. • Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, found in supplements and used to fortify grains. • L-methylfolate, the active form of folate, helps produce the neurotransmitters critical to regulating mood. About 50% of Americans have genetic variations that reduce their ability to create L-methylfolate, which may raise their risk of depression. Sources: CNS Spectrum; WSJ reporting\n\nThe biggest gripe with Deplin is the cost: One month\'s supply of Deplin, either at 7.5 milligrams or 15 milligrams, can cost as much as $98 and not all insurers cover it. Pamlab has a licensed generic version called simply L-Methylfolate that went on the market in August and is priced somewhat lower. More insurers are covering that version, some with copayments as low as $20, says Pamlab, which also makes medical foods for managing other conditions, including asthma.\n\nPamlab officials say they hope eventually to win FDA approval for Deplin as a prescription drug. The company says it plans to start Phase II trials later this year; one branch of the trials will assess whether Deplin could effectively treat depression on its own.\n\nResearchers also hope to determine which patients would benefit most from Deplin, to cut down on the frustrating trial-and-error process many people face in finding an effective antidepressant. One target could be people who have a genetic variation that reduces their ability to make L-methylfolate. Roughly 30% of the U.S. population has one abnormal copy of the gene known as MTHFR 677, and 12% has two abnormal copies, giving them less than one-third of the typical amount of L-methylfolate, researchers say.\n\nBut some people who had two normal copies of the MTHFR gene also responded well to Deplin, ""so there are clearly other factors involved as well,"" says Harold Koch, Pamlab\'s chief scientific officer.\n\nDespite the uncertainties, some clinicians say they are comfortable prescribing Deplin. ""I have had people write me thank-you notes because it\'s given them a boost of energy and happiness,"" says Judy Paley, an internist in Denver, Colo.\n\n""My patients who have responded are not people who are suggestible. They\'ve been trying different medications for years,"" says Andres San Martin, a Manhattan psychiatrist who specializes in treating resistant depression.\n\nOther experts are more cautious. ""It doesn\'t appear to have a lot of downsides, but sometimes it takes a few years of use to recognize them,"" says Ken Duckworth, medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an education and advocacy group. Dr. Duckworth also urges patients with resistant depression to try cognitive-behavioral therapy, aerobic exercise and substance-abuse programs, all of which have clear evidence of effectiveness. ""And remember there is no silver bullet,"" he says.\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com']",This story says there is a “growing buzz” surrounding a new approach to depression treatment. It should have more forcefully delivered the buzzkill: there is almost no supporting trial evidence.,"The story looks at a supplement that contains a derivative of folic acid known as L-methylfolate (brand name Deplin). Although there is a reasonable theoretical basis to think that this supplement might be beneficial for treating depression, there is very little evidence from clinical studies to support its use. With that in mind, we were dismayed to see so many quotes from clinicians who say their patients seem to benefit from the supplement, while so little time is spent discussing the shortcomings of the current evidence base–which are considerable. The story does eventually get to an appropriate message: “clinical evidence is limited”; it’s just that this conclusion may get lost in the clutter of surrounding anecdotes.

The most common drugs before treatment were metformin, a generic taken by about half of patients, followed by the medicines Avandia and Actos, taken by more than one-third of patients.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins researchers also calculated the effects of surgery on health costs for the patients. After a $616 increase in expenses during the first year following surgery, the costs declined by $2,179 in the second year and $4,497 in year three. The costs were compared with the median annual health costs before surgery -- $6,367.\n\nThe researchers argue that the findings, drawn from data on four years of claims made in seven states, support coverage of bariatric surgery by insurers because of the savings and improvements in patients' health.\n\nThe ultimate savings case requires some extrapolation, though. The cost of the surgery was about $30,000, which exceeds the savings observed directly. Also, at two years after surgery, data were available for less than half the patients.

They all had greater antibacterial effect after five minutes compared to lab specimens exposed to plain alcohol, but thyme was the most potent.\n\nIn fact, the thyme tincture was more powerful than standard concentrations of benzoyl peroxide, which is the active ingredient in many acne products. The new findings were presented at the Society for General Microbiology\'s Spring Conference in Dublin.\n\n""If thyme tincture is proven to be as clinically effective as our findings suggest, it may be a natural alternative to current treatments,"" researcher Margarita Gomez-Escalada, PhD, says in a news release. ""The problem with treatments containing benzoyl peroxide is the side effects they are associated with,"" namely a burning sensation and skin irritation.\n\n""Herbal preparations are less harsh on the skin due to their anti-inflammatory properties, while our results suggest they can be just as, if not more, effective than chemical treatments,"" she says.\n\nBut some U.S. dermatologists are quick to caution that while intriguing, this research is still preliminary, and thyme-tinged acne treatments are not yet ready for prime time.']",Read that headline above.  What does “may be coming soon” mean to you?  Don’t hold your breath if soon implies to you anything like the standard definition of “a short time.”,"The story failed to make clear that this work was not done on people – but on cells in a lab dish.
It also relied too heavily on a news release coming out of a conference. Perhaps after some peer review and some actual human testing, this thyme treatment could be ready for store shelves. For now, there’s too much hype here and not enough evidence.

She presented results of the study at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics medical conference in Denver; results were simultaneously published online Thursday by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Al-Lamee cautioned that the findings apply to a minority of the population of patients who now receive stents, those with narrowing of only one artery and certain other characteristics. She said the study doesn’t apply to patients having heart attacks, who may benefit from stents, and to patients with chest pain who have disease in more than one artery.\n\nThe study also found that stents improved blood supply to the heart versus placebo, she said.\n\nStill, the study could affect a portion of a multibillion business for stent manufacturers including Medtronic PLC, Abbott Laboratories and Boston Scientific Corp. About 500,000 stents are implanted for stable angina each year world-wide, the study’s researchers wrote in The Lancet.\n\nAbbott spokesman Jonathon Hamilton said the new study had patients with mild disease “who weren’t reflective of patients who typically undergo stenting procedures,” and that some patients received stents in the trial who wouldn’t have gotten them otherwise because of the study design.\n\nMedtronic and Boston Scientific all referred questions about the study to a statement issued Thursday by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, whose members include cardiologists who perform stent procedures. The SCAI said it questioned the study’s conclusions, and that SCAI believes stents are the preferred treatment for cardiac patients who need more than medicines to improve health and quality of life.\n\nBut some doctors said the study’s outcome should discourage use of stents in many patients.\n\nThe results show “unequivocally” that there are no benefits for stent procedures compared with drugs for stable angina, two cardiologists wrote in an editorial accompanying the results in The Lancet.\n\nThe cardiologists, David L. Brown of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Rita F. Redberg of University of California, San Francisco, called for cardiology-treatment guidelines to downgrade the recommendation of stents for stable chest pain, and focus on treating these patients with medicine.\n\nPast studies have proven that stents can save lives when used in acute situations like heart attacks. But other studies have challenged their uses in patients with less severe disease and symptoms, including a landmark study released in 2007. Changes to treatment guidelines since then have curbed the over-use of stent procedures, according to a 2015 study .\n\nWhile the new study’s findings are being debated, it is notable for its design: It is the first to compare stents with placebo while keeping patients in the dark about whether or not they received a stent. All patients had catheters inserted in an artery and were heavily sedated before being taken into a catheter lab. But only about half were given actual stents, while the rest were left on cath-lab tables for about 15 minutes, then had the catheters removed.\n\nResearchers chose this design to minimize the “placebo effect” seen in past studies, in which a portion of symptom improvement in patients receiving stents could be attributed to their expectation that the stent would make them feel better.\n\nAll patients in the study took drugs including aspirin, anti-platelet drugs, cholesterol-lowering statins and beta blockers for about six weeks. This was followed by baseline treadmill tests and either the stent or sham procedure. They underwent treadmill tests again six weeks after the procedures. Researchers used exercise time as the main measure because physical exertion is usually what triggers angina, and it usually goes away when patients rest, Dr. Al-Lamee said.\n\nPatients receiving stents improved their exercise times by an average of 28 seconds, while those who didn’t improved their times by an average of nearly 12 seconds. But the difference wasn’t statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance.\n\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com']",A robust discussion of what the study measured was a strong point of this story.,"This Wall Street Journal story describes surprising news that a very common procedure– inserting a stent to open a blocked blood vessel — does not add benefit over medication in patients with angina. Angina is chest pain due to blocked heart arteries, and is common among people with heart disease.
One strength of the story is the detailed description of the study itself and in finding outside sources to critique aspects of the study. We do think the cost of the procedure was worth discussion, as well as the potential harms, but they were not addressed in this story. These points were raised in the New York Times story, which we also reviewed.

Topical treatments are available for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but there has a lack of long-term follow-up data to guide treatment decisions. A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n\nMore than 80% of all skin cancers are BCC, arising from the basal cells (i.e., small, round cells found in the lower layer of the epidermis). There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. The prognosis is excellent, but it can cause significant disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues.\n\nWhile most types of BCC require surgery, superficial BCC can be treated topically with noninvasive treatments such as PDT, imiquimod cream, fluorouracil cream, cryosurgery or electrodessication and curettage.\n\nInvestigators in the Netherlands report the results of a three-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial that compared three noninvasive treatments that included imiquimod and fluorouracil cream. ""The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams,"" explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. ""Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices.""\n\nHowever, prior to this study there has been a lack of randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up that compare the effectiveness of noninvasive treatments. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC.\n\nA total of 601 patients with a superficial BCC participated in this study: 202 patients were treated with methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), 198 with imiquimod cream, and 201 with fluorouracil cream. The three study groups had a similar distribution of baseline characteristics, with the exception of tumor size.\n\nAround 80% of patients with superficial BCC were tumor free after imiquimod treatment after three years. The clearance rate was 68% for patients treated with fluorouracil and 58% for individuals receiving PDT.\n\n""Based on our findings, both imiquimod and fluorouracil are effective noninvasive treatments in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, but the data provide no definite evidence for superiority of imiquimod to fluorouracil,"" commented Dr. Roozeboom. ""Both creams have an equal cosmetic outcome and risk of local adverse events. Fluorouracil has the advantage of being less expensive than imiquimod. However, between one- and three-year follow-up, more recurrences were diagnosed in the fluorouracil group compared with the imiquimod group.""\n\n""When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account. For example, we have found that in superficial BCC on the lower extremities in older patients, PDT should be prescribed rather than imiquimod. Our evidence indicates that a personalized treatment approach is necessary,"" added Dr. Roozeboom.\n\n###\n\nNotes for editors\n\n""Three year follow-up results of photodynamic therapy versus imiquimod versus fluorouracil for treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma: a single blind, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial,"" by Marieke H.

The study compares two different forms of topical treatment with photo-dynamic therapy (which employs a photosensitizing agent along with a particular type of light).

The release does a nice, pithy job of summarizing the issues being addressed as well as the advances in knowledge that resulted. It includes lots of numbers — totals and percentages, which we applaud. It notes high in the release that the work is a randomized, controlled clinical trial, which we also applaud. But we think it might have been more complete had it noted that surgery is the most common treatment for skin cancers and is an option for the superficial ones studied here, and if the authors declared no conflicts of interest, especially since the authors talk about potential drawbacks of a cheaper treatment.

SCIENTISTS DISCOVER ANTIBODY THAT REDUCES BODY FAT IN MICE,"['A treatment for obesity could be on the horizon as scientists have discovered an antibody that reduces body fat.\n\nIn trials on mice, the antibody was found to increase bone mass and reduce adipose tissue (fat)—and while human studies are some way off, the findings could lead to new treatments for weight loss and osteoporosis.\n\nThe antibody discovered targets follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) found in the pituitary gland. Ten years ago, scientists started looking at the hormones made in the pituitary gland to see how they act on certain targets. They found some of these hormones had an effect on bone mass.\n\nSubscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week\n\nMatt Cardy/Getty\n\nFrom this, they created an antibody to see if it could be used to prevent bone loss in mice—and in 2010, they showed it could. As a result, they started considering it as a potential treatment for osteoporosis, particularly in post-menopausal women—a period when women lose bone mass fairly quickly.\n\nBut scientists also realized it could have other uses. Mone Zaidi, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, is one of the authors on the latest study into how the antibody triggers weight loss. “Osteoporosis and obesity are fairly closely linked in several ways,” he tells Newsweek. “Women, when they undergo menopause, lose bone and gain body fat. So we thought maybe there was a connection—that FSH could have direct effects on adipose tissue.”\n\nIn the study, published in Nature, scientists injected the antibody into mice that had had their ovaries removed (mimicking menopause) and mice that had been fed on a high-fat diet. In both cases, the antibody caused significant weight loss and gains in bone mass.\n\nZaidi says they looked at the adipose tissue in different areas of the body, including under the skin and around the vital organs. “In all compartments it was [fat] reduced by around this level. It’s a fairly dramatic effect.” Mice also showed increased oxygen consumption, higher levels of physical activity and more heat production in beige fat (which dissipates energy around the body).\n\nBut how do mice models translate to human treatments? Mice a fairly close genetic match to Humans, and Zaidi is hopeful there will be similar effects in humans.\n\nTheir next step is to “humanize” the antibody, so it can be tested without triggering an immune response. “We would then hopefully go to the next phase of preclinical testing, which would be to look at side effects, toxicology etc. After that, we would go into primates and larger animals. That would then lead—if all goes well—to the first human trials in three to four years.”\n\nAt present, the researchers are focusing on the adiposity, rather than bone loss, for drug development: “I think obesity is a more prevalent disease—but osteoporosis at the tail end can be tagged on. Also to do trials for osteoporosis takes a very long time,” Zaidi says.\n\nEventually, he hopes to end up with an injected drug that gets rid of fat and increases bone mass. “That’s the ideal situation,” he says. “It could be a unique obesity drug. But it could also be a unique drug because it lowers body fat and makes bones stronger. And the population that could be most benefited by this could be post-menopausal women.”\n\nCommenting on the research, Tim Speckor, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London, U.K., says: “It’s a nice mouse study that seems to work—whether it works in humans is another matter.”']",The story does not tell readers that the researcher who is quoted in the story has filed a provisional patent for the antibody.,"The story focuses on a study recently published in Nature, in which researchers reported being able to reduce body fat and increase bone mass in mice by injecting them with a specific antibody.
The story makes clear that this research was done in rodents and therefore is years away (at best) from even beginning clinical trials in humans. But if a story is going to discuss the potential benefits, such as this one does, it has a responsibility to place the work in context by touching on issues related to the quality of the evidence, conflicts of interest and potential adverse health effects — even if only to say that no one knows what those adverse effects may be in humans.

Both analyze multiple genes in a biopsy sample and give a score for aggressiveness, similar to tests used now for certain breast and colon cancers.\n\nDoctors say tests like these have the potential to curb a major problem in cancer care — overtreatment. Prostate tumors usually grow so slowly they will never threaten a man\'s life, but some prove fatal and there is no reliable way now to tell which ones will. Treatment with surgery, radiation or hormone blockers isn\'t needed in most cases and can cause impotence or incontinence, yet most men are afraid to skip it.\n\n""We\'re not giving patients enough information to make their decision,"" said Dr. Peter Carroll, chairman of urology at the University of California, San Francisco. ""You can shop for a toaster"" better than for prostate treatment, he said.\n\nA study he led of the newest test — the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score — is set for discussion Wednesday at an American Urological Association meeting in San Diego.\n\nThe results suggest the test could triple the number of men thought to be at such low risk for aggressive disease that monitoring is a clearly safe option. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed.\n\nIndependent experts say such a test is desperately needed but that it\'s unclear how much information this one adds or whether it will be enough to persuade men with low-risk tumors to forgo treatment, and treat it only if it gets worse. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now.\n\n""The question is, what\'s the magnitude of difference that would change the patient\'s mind?"" said Dr. Bruce Roth, a cancer specialist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nOne man may view a 15 percent chance that his tumor is aggressive as low risk ""but someone else might say, \'Oh my God, let\'s set the surgery up tomorrow,\'"" he said. ""I don\'t think it\'s a slam dunk.""\n\nAlso unknown: Will insurers pay for the expensive test without evidence it leads to better care or saves lives?\n\nThe newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. Doctors at first were leery of it until studies in more groups of women proved its value, and the same may happen with the prostate test, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society\'s deputy chief medical officer.\n\nThe company will charge $3,820 for the prostate test and says it can save money by avoiding costlier, unnecessary treatment. Another test for assessing prostate cancer risk that came out last summer — Prolaris by Myriad Genetics Inc. — sells for $3,400.\n\nBoth companies can sell the tests without Food and Drug Administration approval under separate rules that govern lab diagnostics. Myriad Genetics has published nine studies on Prolaris involving more than 3,000 patients. Genomic Health has not published any results on the prostate test, another thing that makes doctors wary. Yet it has a track record from its breast cancer test.\n\nAbout 240,000 men in the U.S. are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and about half are classified as low risk using current methods. Doctors now base risk estimates on factors such as a man\'s age and how aggressive cells look from biopsies that give 12 to 14 tissue samples. But tumors often are spread out and vary from one spot to the other.\n\n""Unless you can be sure your biopsy has hit the most aggressive part that\'s in the prostate, you can\'t be sure"" how accurate your risk estimate is, explained Dr. Eric Klein, chief of urology at the Cleveland Clinic, who led early development of the Oncotype prostate cancer test.\n\nFor one study, researchers used prostates removed from 440 men. They measured the activity of hundreds of genes thought to be involved in whether the cancer spread beyond the prostate or proved fatal. A second study of biopsies from 167 patients narrowed it down to 81 genes, and researchers picked 17 that seemed to predict aggressiveness no matter the location in the tumor.\n\nA third study used single needle-biopsy samples from 395 UCSF patients scheduled to have their prostates removed. The gene test accurately predicted the aggressiveness of their cancer once doctors were able to see the whole prostate after surgery.\n\nUsing one current method, 37 of the 395 men would have been called very low risk and good candidates for monitoring. Adding the gene test put 100 men into that category, said another study leader, Dr. Matthew Cooperberg of UCSF. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.\n\n""It went both ways — that was the remarkable thing. In any category of risk it added independent information compared to the standard criteria we use today,"" Carroll said. ""More work needs to be done, but, in my opinion, this is a very good start.""\n\nHowever, Dr. Kevin McVary, chairman of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and a spokesman for the Urological Association, said the test must be validated in more men before it can be widely used.\n\n""It\'s not there yet,"" he said.\n\nUCSF just got a federal grant to see how men choose treatments and whether this test might sway them.\n\n""We throw all these numbers at them. Are they really going to make a better decision?"" Cooperberg said.\n\nDean Smith, 60, a retired marketing executive from Mill Valley, Calif., is following his doctor\'s advice to monitor the cancer he was diagnosed with in March. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.\n\nAt least six of his friends suffered side effects ranging from urinary leakage to inability to have sex after having their prostates removed.\n\n""I would suspect that having cancer and having to live with it would be very difficult for them,"" but it doesn\'t bother him, Smith said. ""I will die from something other than prostate cancer, I guarantee you.""']","Solid medical conference reporting, with many expert interviews and good context provided.  Goes far beyond the conference presentation itself.","The story employed very careful presentation of both the promise and the potential limitations of two new prostate cancer gene tests.
Until recently, the PSA test was routinely used as a screening instrument for prostate cancer resulting in millions of men suddenly facing a set of interesting choices.  If the PSA is elevated, should a biopsy be performed?  If so, how reliable is the Gleason scoring system in predicting the risk of spread and death? Because of uncertainty, many men undergo potentially needless surgical procedures rather than perhaps watchful waiting.  A new and potentially more reliable test to determine the aggressiveness of the tumor type in concert with a Gleason score or as a replacement would be welcomed.  A reliable predictive test of risk of death from prostate cancer would add considerably to the decision process.

""It started in patches, but eventually I lost it all.""\n\nA few years ago Velasquez-Manoff was working on a book about autoimmune diseases, like allergies, asthma, Crohn\'s disease and alopecia. He talked to many people who were using an unlikely tool to treat their problems: parasitic worms that live in your gut — permanently.\n\nThe worms were getting rave reviews. ""People were saying, \'I had absolutely zero symptoms. And my disease went into remission!\'"" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nSo he started to wonder: Could these worms cure his alopecia? Maybe his hay fever, too?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Moises Velasquez-Manoff Courtesy of Moises Velasquez-Manoff\n\nHe went down to Mexico, bought 30 hookworms and let the larvae infect him.\n\nHookworm larvae are microscopic. But they have little spikes that puncture the skin and allow the larvae to burrow inside you. Then the critters head straight for a capillary.\n\n""They basically ride your bloodstream back through your heart, into your lungs,"" where they hang out for a while, Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nThen the larvae crawl out of the lung through your stomach and into the small intestine — where they bite onto the intestinal wall and start sucking blood — a few drops a day.\n\nAt that point, the worms do something amazing: They suppress the immune system, says P\'ng Loke, an immunologist at the New York University School of Medicine.\n\n""That\'s the really fascinating thing,"" he says. You see, the worms don\'t shut down the immune system completely — just enough so that the immune cells won\'t attack the worm.\n\nBut this can help with something else. It can keep the immune system from getting out of control and attacking the body.\n\n""If you think about it, the worst thing that you want is an immune system that\'s out of control,"" Loke says.\n\nWhy? Because that\'s when you get autoimmune problems. So the hypothesis is that intestinal worms could possibly reverse these problems, by damping down the immune system.\n\nThe idea was so promising, that back in 2011 a pharmaceutical company decided to test it in clinical trials. Coronado Biosciences put together about six large studies.\n\nThe first study to finish was a big one in Europe that looked to see if pig whipworms helped with Crohn\'s disease.\n\nThe bottom line: ""The proportion of patients who improved with the worms was no different than the proportion of patients who were improved with placebo,"" says Dr. Stephen Hanauer at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who was involved with one trial.\n\nThe whipworms were so ineffective at stopping Crohn\'s disease that Coronado canceled its other trials. The company\'s stock plummeted. And eventually the company changed its name and focus.\n\nOther trials with worms haven\'t gone so well either, says Hanauer. ""The controlled trials, thus far, in a variety of different diseases including childhood allergies and asthma have not been positive.""\n\nIt\'s unclear why the worms haven\'t worked in these trials, Loke says. It could be that the whipworm larvae weren\'t prepared correctly. Or that the worms work for some people but not others. It may depend on a person\'s genes.\n\nBack in Berkeley, Velasquez-Manoff thought he might one of the lucky ones.\n\nA little while after he took the hookworms, his hay fever disappeared.\n\n""Like just gone, gone, gone,"" he says.\n\nAnd his hair?\n\n""Then I had like, little bit of peach fuzzy hair growing here and there on my body,"" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nBut then the tide turned. ""Suddenly it\'s like one day, the whole thing reversed.""\n\nHis hay fever came back. The hair didn\'t grow anymore.\n\nAnd having worms in his body wasn\'t pleasant. At first, he had diarrhea and cramps. That got better. But even months later, he still felt kind of bad.\n\n""I never got back to feeling completely normal for that year [that the worms were inside],"" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nHe says the benefits of the worms definitely didn\'t outweigh the bad side effects. And he would never try treating his alopecia or hay fever with them again.\n\n""The way I thought of it was, would I give this to my kids? And the answer is pretty easily and obviously: Hell no,"" Velasquez-Manoff says. ""I wouldn\'t want them to feel this way.""']",We wondered: What was the point of the story?,"Hookworms on intestines. Credit: CDC
This story ran as part of a series entitled “Worm Week.” The headline poses the question: “Could Worms in Your Gut Cure Your Allergies?” Or for that matter, could they cure other autoimmune diseases such as asthma, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease?
We have problems with headlines like this one and offer tips on how they can be improved.
The story states that “the worms do something amazing: They suppress the immune system.” And it explains that based on this, there’s a hypothesis that the worms also might work for specific autoimmune diseases.
But then we learn, actually no, they don’t seem to work based on disappointing clinical evidence. So, what about that hypothesis, then? The story doesn’t return to that, instead it just implies that there was something wrong with the research, not the hypothesis. And it never tells us some important facts about using worms in this way, such as that they’re illegal to use therapeutically in the U.S., and that if they are used, they carry very serious risks.
This left us wondering: What was the point of the story? As it’s written, the confusing hypothesis vs evidence set-up is more bewildering than informative, and readers are left in the dark on some important realities of using a risky, unproven treatment.

Among other things, breast milk contains natural sources of prebiotics: small, indigestible fiber molecules that promote the growth of good bacteria in the baby\'s gut. Yet for many families, breastfeeding is difficult or impossible. Fortunately, modern infant formulas are getting closer to the real thing with the help of University of Illinois researchers.\n\nIn a recent study from the Piglet Nutrition and Cognition Lab at U of I, scientists worked with piglets to show prebiotics included in infant formula can enhance memory and exploratory behavior.\n\n""When we provide prebiotics in formula, our results confirm that we can not only benefit gut health, which is known, but we can also influence brain development,"" says Ryan Dilger, associate professor in the Department of Animal Sciences, Division of Nutritional Sciences, and Neuroscience Program at U of I. ""We can actually change the way piglets learn and remember by influencing bacteria in the colon.""\n\nPiglets are widely considered a more informative model for human infants than mice and rats; their digestive systems, behavioral responses, and brain development are remarkably similar to human infants. Therefore, researchers are increasingly turning to piglets to test hypotheses in pre-clinical trials related to human health, especially in the context of gut microbes and brain development.\n\n""There hasn\'t been a lot of work looking at the gut-brain axis in humans, but a lot of rodent work is showing those connections. This is taking it to an animal model that is a lot closer to human infants and asking if that connection still exists and if we can tease out possible mechanisms,"" says Stephen Fleming, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the Neuroscience Program at U of I.\n\nIn early 2016, Dilger and his colleagues worked with piglets to show that a combination of innovative formula components, including prebiotics, may play a role in brain development and behavior. In their new study, the team concentrated solely on the effects of prebiotics.\n\nStarting on the second day of life, piglets were given a cow\'s milk-based infant formula supplemented with polydextrose (PDX), a synthetic carbohydrate with prebiotic activity, and galactooligosaccharide (GOS), a naturally occurring prebiotic. When the piglets were 25 days old, Fleming took them through several learning, memory, and stress tests. After 33 days, blood, brain, and intestinal tissues were collected for analysis.\n\nThe test for learning and memory gave piglets a chance to play with dog toys: one they\'d seen before and one brand-new toy. If they spent more time with the new toy, that was an indication that the piglet recognized it as new and preferred it. This ""novel object recognition"" test improves on classic maze tests commonly used in rodent studies.\n\n""If you\'re trying to test for memory, this test is closer to what we\'d do with an infant. After all, we don\'t generally train infants on mazes,"" Fleming says. ""We know from previous research this test works for pigs, but this is the first published example of using it in a nutrition context.""\n\nPigs fed PDX and GOS spent more time playing with new objects than pigs who didn\'t receive the prebiotic supplements. The preference for novel objects, an indication of natural curiosity, is a sign of healthy brain development and points towards positive development of learning and memory.\n\nWhen prebiotics are working the way they should, good bacteria increase in abundance. One way to tell is by looking at metabolic end-products - volatile fatty acids (VFAs) - excreted by bacteria during digestion of prebiotic fibers.\n\n""Volatile fatty acids are a global indicator for whether prebiotics had an effect on the overall population of bacteria. For example, we might want to see an increase in Lactobacillus and other beneficial bacteria that produce butyrate,"" Dilger explains. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations in the colon, blood, and brain were changed in pigs receiving PDX and GOS compared with control pigs.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that bacterial VFAs could be getting into the blood and traveling to the brain, where they could potentially affect mood and behavior.\n\n""We found that, yes, VFAs are absorbed in the blood of pigs that were fed PDX/GOS. And, yes, they do get into the brain,"" Fleming explains. ""But when we looked at the relationship between these VFAs and the results of our behavior tests, there did not appear to be a clear connection.""\n\nAnother surprise was a decrease in serotonin in brains of pigs fed the prebiotic. ""When you hear less serotonin, there\'s an immediate reaction to say, \'Well, that\'s bad,\'"" Fleming says. Not necessarily; those pigs didn\'t show greater anxiety than control pigs during a stress test or poorer performance when given a learning and memory test. The researchers hypothesize that the prebiotics may alter levels of tryptophan, serotonin\'s amino acid precursor, but it\'s too early to say.\n\nAlthough more work is needed to tackle remaining questions, the study adds to the growing body of research suggesting a strong and potentially modifiable link between the gut and the brain: a link that makers of infant formula should strongly consider.\n\n""There are so many ways we can alter the composition of the microbiota and they can have very strong benefits. Promoting good \'gut health\' remains a strong focus in the field of nutrition,"" Dilger says.\n\n###\n\nThe article, ""Dietary polydextrose and galactooligosaccharide increase exploratory behavior, improve recognition memory, and alter neurochemistry in the young pig,"" is published in Nutritional Neuroscience. Fleming and Dilger\'s co-authors include Supida Monaikul, Alexander Patsavas, Rosaline Waworuntu, and Brian Berg. The work was supported by Mead Johnson Nutrition.']",The headline of this release needs two additional words: “in pigs.”,"Using piglets to test hypotheses related to infant brain development and the consumption of prebiotics seems to be important research, but at this point, it is hard to tell how relevant this research is to humans. A better discussion of the benefits and harms found in the study, as well as the human relevance of the overall research would have greatly improved this release. Nothing in the release relates to breast milk — it only compared formulas. Any discussion of formula versus breast milk in infant development needs to refer to the overall context of what we know about the topic already and this release skipped those details.

The findings were published today in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.\n\n""The development of osteoporosis drugs by pharmaceutical companies has focused heavily on blocking CatK in recent years,"" said Dieter Brömme, a professor in the faculty of dentistry and a Canada Research Chair in Proteases and Disease. ""All clinical trials to date have failed due to side effects ranging from stroke, skin fibrosis and cardiovascular issues. We\'ve found a way to block CatK only in bone tissue that we think will prevent these other negative effects.""\n\nThe researchers tested a compound derived from red sage in human and mouse bone cells and a mouse model. They found that it prevented bone loss and increased the bone mineral density of the mice treated with the compound by 35 per cent, when compared with the control group.\n\nThe study builds on previous research by Brömme and his team that looked at the effectiveness of red sage, known as Danshen in Chinese and used to treat bone ailments, in stopping the activity of CatK in limited ways.\n\nEnzyme blockers work like keys in locks. Most drugs in development have been so called active site-directed inhibitors, which act like master keys and lock the entire enzyme, blocking both its disease-relevant functions such as collagen degradation and its other normal functions.\n\n""CatK is a multifunctional enzyme with important roles in other parts of the body and we think completely blocking it is what causes unexpected side effects in other drugs,"" said Preety Panwar, a research associate in the Brömme lab. ""Our compound only locks the collagen -degrading CatK activity, preventing the unregulated breakdown of collagen in bones without any other negative impacts.""\n\nThe treatment could also potentially be used to treat a variety of other bone and cartilage diseases such as arthritis and certain bone cancers.\n\nOsteoporosis is a global health problem that will affect one out of three women and one of out five men worldwide, with a multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical industry dedicated to finding treatments to stop its progression.\n\n###']",This is very preliminary research and the limitations of animal research and small samples should have been mentioned in the release.,"This news release describes research showing that a chemical compound in the red sage plant blocks an enzyme that promotes the breakdown of collagen in bones. This might be an interesting lead for scientists, but the release prematurely dubs the plant a “treatment” for osteoporosis and doesn’t mention that effects observed in cells in a lab dish or in mice might not translate to a benefit for human patients. The result people care about — reducing fractures — isn’t brought up. The news release’s assertion that this herb “might hold the key to a new osteoporosis therapy that could prevent bone loss without causing side effects” might raise false hopes.

This version has been corrected.\n\nA small company started by a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester has moved closer to providing doctors with what he says is a simple, computer-based tool to help detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems has received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Cognivue, a cognitive-assessment tool that functions somewhat like a video game. A patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a time-strapped primary-care physician tends to other patients. The 10-minute, non\xadinvasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain’s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia.\n\nThe federal government’s approval to market the device comes as Alzheimer’s researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages.\n\n[Scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for Alzheimer’s disease]\n\n“Look, there is a late-life tsunami of late-life cognitive decline coming at us, and health-care providers are standing on the beach,” said Charles J. Duffy, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who founded the company. “What we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care.”\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of dementia. That number is expected to reach 13.5 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. In addition to Alzheimer’s, a person’s mental competency can be hindered by other conditions, such as untreated diabetes, thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications.\n\nDuffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test people’s memory and ability to think.\n\nWith Cognivue, patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images, such as a group of dots, that move around and fluctuate in clarity. Using a rotary-shaped mouse called a manipulandum, the patients try to follow the dots with a wedge-shaped cursor. The task becomes more difficult, especially for people with early stages of dementia, as the dots move around, changing their direction, speed and intensity.\n\n“All perception is interpretive, and so what we’re doing is measuring that process,” Duffy said. Other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems’ device received de novo approval from the FDA, a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk.\n\nThe Pittsford, N.Y.-based company’s FDA application included data from a comparative study involving 401 people recruited from 13 communities for older adults. The subjects, ranging in age from 55 to 95, were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities: normal, mild cognitive impairment and impaired. Their performance on the Cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS).\n\nThe device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven.\n\nLinda M. Rice, a primary-care internist with about 1,200 patients in her Rochester practice, said that after a year of using the device in her clinic, she is convinced of its worth. About half of her patients are older than 65, and they often have questions about memory loss and their cognitive abilities.\n\nBut her options for rating their performance involve administering the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) , also known as the Folstein test, that uses a 30-point questionnaire. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.\n\n“You have to be pretty bad to do poorly on this exam,” she said.\n\nBut the alternative involves referring patients for a battery of neuropsychiatric tests that can take hours to complete and cost $1,000 or more. The computer-based tool created by Duffy has helped Rice to convince some patients that it’s time to stop driving and to start them on medications sooner to slow the progress of Alzheimer’s.\n\n“I think it’s a really potentially valuable tool,” said Leslie Algase, an internist who tends about 2,000 patients in Rochester, at least 30 percent of whom are older than 65. Algase, who said she has no financial ties to the company, agreed to use the Cognivue in her practice about three years ago after meeting Duffy at a conference.\n\nAlgase rates the device as about as accurate as the MMSE. But she said it’s more convenient and less time-consuming to administer.']",The 2-star score doesn’t reflect the significant legwork that went into this piece. But that effort could have been applied to better effect in several areas that are highlighted in this review.,"There was more to like about this story than its 2-star score might suggest. There is substantial and thorough reporting about the problems with current approaches to diagnosing dementia, and the story demonstrates great legwork in seeking out the opinions of experts who have used the device that’s profiled in the piece. A lot of 2-star stories seem to be thrown together without much original reporting, and that’s certainly not the case here.
With that being said, the story does lack some key information regarding the benefits, costs, and harms of the device. There were also a few borderline calls where we felt that a Satisfactory score couldn’t be given for specific reasons, even though the story came close to meeting our standard. In short, a few small changes would have altered our ratings substantially and resulted in a higher score. But the story is still well worth a read, and delivers plenty of valuable information. We encourage you to explore our comments in the review below to see how we thought the story could have been improved.

Decipher is a Medicare-covered genomic test capable of predicting tumor aggressiveness in men following prostate surgery. The study, titled ""Impact of a Genomic Classifier of Metastatic Risk on Postprostatectomy Treatment Recommendations by Radiation Oncologists and Urologists,"" was published in this month\'s issue of Urology.\n\n""Conflicting treatment recommendations by different specialists looking at the same disease can be highly confusing for patients and is a problem for the health care system in general,"" said Paul Nguyen, M.D., of Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women\'s Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School. ""The Decipher test\'s tendency to make the two specialties more concordant in their treatment recommendations provides significant value toward standardizing care for patients.""\n\nThe study was designed to evaluate how the Decipher Prostate Cancer Classifier, which predicts the risk of metastasis after prostatectomy, would impact adjuvant treatment recommendations made by urologists and radiation oncologists. These two specialties often disagree on which patients should receive radiation therapy following surgery and when.\n\nUsing clinical information alone, observation rather than adjuvant radiation therapy was recommended in 42% of decisions made by urologists and 23% of decisions by radiation oncologists (P < .0001). The Decipher test results altered 45% and 35% of treatment recommendations made by urologists and radiation oncologists, respectively. Decipher results indicating genomic high risk resulted in intensification of treatment, whereas genomic low risk resulted in less aggressive recommendations. The Decipher results increased agreement in treatment recommendations between urologists and radiation oncologists, as the odds of a recommendation for adjuvant treatment by urologists vs radiation oncologists increased from 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.44) to 0.46 (95% CI, 0.29-0.75) after results of the Decipher test were made available.\n\n""It is notable that while the Decipher test significantly influenced treatment decisions, it did not increase the total number of people receiving adjuvant therapy, suggesting that it helped ensure that the ones selected for adjuvant therapy are the ones most likely to benefit from it,"" said Doug Dolginow, M.D., chief executive officer of GenomeDx. ""As genomic tests like Decipher become used more routinely in urologic cancer patient care, they will have a greater impact on treatment recommendations in clinical practice and allow for better personalization of therapy.""\n\nThe Decipher test used in this study has been previously described in multiple blinded independent validation studies in men at high risk of recurrence at the time of prostatectomy. Researchers found that 60% of the clinically high-risk men would be reclassified as low risk based on the Decipher test and have only a 2.4% risk of metastasis at 5 years after surgery. In addition, the 19% of the patients with the highest risk based on Decipher had a nearly 10-fold higher risk of distant metastases by 5 years. The test provided a more accurate and precise estimate of a patient\'s risk of recurrence. Use of this test therefore has the potential to assist clinicians to better direct utilization of secondary therapy after surgery.\n\nAbout Decipher®\n\nThe Decipher® Prostate Cancer Classifier is a highly validated and commercially available genomic test for men with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer. Decipher predicts cancer aggressiveness by looking for a unique genomic signature comprised of a validated series of biomarkers associated with metastatic disease. Adding truly unique information to the treatment decision-making process, Decipher generates a risk result that is completely independent and distinct from PSA, Gleason score and other clinical risk factors. Clinical studies from leading cancer centers published in over a dozen medical journals demonstrate that Decipher can accurately predict metastatic disease, which men may benefit from radiation therapy following prostate surgery, and can lead to significant cost-savings for healthcare systems. Decipher was developed in partnership with the Mayo Clinic.\n\nDecipher is covered by Medicare and multiple private insurance plans in the US.\n\nLearn more at: www.DecipherTest.com and follow Decipher on Twitter @DecipherTest and on Facebook.\n\nAbout GenomeDx Biosciences\n\nGenomeDx Biosciences is focused on transforming cancer patient care by putting usable genomic information in the hands of patients and their physicians.

But it lacks the context that would truly inform readers about the test’s potential to improve their care.,"In this news release, we’re introduced to a world of confusion among doctors about what to do with a man after they remove his cancerous, walnut-sized prostate gland. And the release offers something that can allegedly reduce that confusion: GenomeDx Biosciences’ Decipher, a test that sniffs out 22 different genetic signals of how a cancer case might play out.
Next we’re told about the struggle between urologists and radiation oncologists. The former group is less likely than the latter to prescribe “adjuvant therapy,” typically radiation, after removing a prostate gland. Missing high-risk cancer cases and not treating them is a problem, of course, but so is treating men who probably don’t need it. (Although we’re never really told why that’s an issue.)
According to the release, Decipher has the ability to change the minds of both urologists (45%) and radiation oncologists (35%), and get more of them to agree what or what not to do with a patient after removal of his cancerous prostate gland. That’s potentially an important advance, but we aren’t provided with crucial context — notably that it’s unclear if the decisions made because of Decipher were actually better decisions that would lead to a reduction in prostate cancer deaths. We’re also never cautioned about the small size of the study, given cost information about the test, or told about potential harms.

Then she developed knee pain so severe that she could not climb stairs.\n\nSo Pierce, a doctoral student in food science, went to see physical therapist Matt Briggs at The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. He performed deep massages, suggested changes in her running form and taught her how to exercise her thigh and gluteal muscles to better protect her knees. She believes all of that helped.\n\nBut Pierce, like a growing number of patients, had another treatment she is convinced helped even more. It’s called ""dry needling,"" and it involves the insertion of thin, non-medicated solid needles into muscles or connective tissues. Proponents say it can reduce pain and improve movement. Pierce has had the procedure more than half a dozen times and believes it is one reason she will be able to run her fourth marathon in November.\n\n“This has kind of changed my life,” she says.\n\nTestimonials like that are a big reason dry needling has caught on with some physical therapists, athletes and other patients, Briggs says. But testimonials are not scientific proof.\n\nAnd there, Briggs says, is where dry needling is lacking. While some studies have shown promise, he says, “the quality of the evidence is not strong.” That’s why Briggs and his colleagues are starting a study looking at dry needling in “runner’s knee,” the condition that has plagued Pierce. Their goal, and the goal of other researchers now looking at dry needling, is to produce results rigorous enough to show whether it really works.\n\nFor now, here’s what consumers should know:\n\nIs this acupuncture?\n\nPhysical therapists say it is not, “though superficially, it may look the same,” says Justin Elliott, vice president of government affairs for the American Physical Therapy Association. For one thing, he says, dry needling as performed by a physical therapist is not rooted in ancient Chinese medicine — there’s no talk about redirecting the body’s energy flow by placing needles at certain points in the body. Instead, needles are placed directly in problem areas.\n\nElliott says dry needling also is practiced by some chiropractors, naturopathic physicians and nurses, which puts it outside the realm of any one specialty.\n\nAcupuncturists beg to differ. “What is being called dry needling is clearly a form of acupuncture” and should be done only by professionals extensively trained in that discipline, says Thomas Burgoon, a West Chester, Pa., physician who is president of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. He says many acupuncturists do exactly what the physical therapists describe, with the same kind of needles.\n\nBurgoon’s group has persuaded some states to bar physical therapists from the practice.\n\n\n\nHow might it work?\n\nOne theory is that the needles cause tight muscles to twitch, then relax. The needles may also increase blood flow or set off nerve responses that alter pain perception, Briggs says.\n\nAnother possibility: It’s a placebo effect, an improvement triggered by the expectation that a treatment will work rather than by the treatment itself. To look for that possibility, the Ohio State study will compare patients who get the real needle treatment to those poked with sham needles that don’t pierce the skin.\n\nMark Crislip, an infectious-disease doctor in Portland, Ore., who recently wrote about dry needling for Science-Based Medicine — a website critical of alternative medicine — says the version practiced by physical therapists doesn’t “come with the mystical baggage that accompanies acupuncture.” But he says it may well be a “theatrical placebo.”\n\nWhat do published studies say?\n\n“It’s a mixed bag,” Elliott says. In a 2011 review, the physical therapy association rated the evidence for dry needling a 3 out of 5, based on the best studies. A formal analysis of 35 trails on acupuncture and dry needling for chronic lower back pain was published by the Cochrane research group in 2005. It found they “may be useful” additions to standard treatment. But it said higher quality studies were needed.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nNeedling can produce minor bleeding and some soreness, but in trained hands, and with the use of sterile needles and gloves, “it’s a very safe procedure,” Briggs says.\n\nIn rare cases, deep needling can lead to a punctured lung or injuries to nerves and blood vessels, and acupuncturists fear non-specialists will be more likely to make such mistakes, Burgoon says.\n\nWill insurers pay for this?\n\nMany will not. Charges for patients can range from $10 to $75 per session, says Edo Zylstra, CEO of KinetaCore, a company that offers intensive three-day weekend courses in dry needling to physical therapists.\n\nDo all physical therapists offer this?\n\nNo. The physical therapy association tells members in seven states to steer clear because of recent court or regulatory decisions or language in existing licensing laws. They are: California, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, New York, South Dakota and Washington.\n\nAnd most of the nation’s 200,000 licensed physical therapists are not trained in the technique. About 6,000 have taken courses in dry needling in the past few years, Zylstra says.']",The story is a tidy overview of the evidence — and lack of evidence — around an alternative technique for treating pain known as “dry needling.”,"This is a story about an alternative therapy known as “dry needling.” It involves inserting needles into the skin, similarly to acupuncture.
The story leads with an anecdote that comes dangerously close to being a promotional advertisement for an unproven alternative therapy for pain, but that’s just the hook. The story (and the headline) is more measured, sifting through what we know and what we don’t know yet about dry needling, largely through interviews with competing trade associations.
We would have liked if the story had gone a step further and delved into the actual science behind dry needling and acupuncture more deeply, and if some of the interviews with people with vested interests had been exchanged for interviews with pain management experts who don’t have a predisposition for or against the procedure. There is enough evidence on acupuncture as a therapy to have persuaded at least some states to create medical licensure programs for its practice, and the story touches at the very end on the idea that there is a training component here that needs further exploration.
[Editor’s note: The notion that the evidence on acupuncture has persuaded states to create medical licensure programs has been contested by the Society for Science-Based Medicine in this post. They argue that evidence is not a factor in state licensing of such practitioners. We have also amended our comments under the “Independent Sources” criterion below in response to their feedback.] 
For this type of story, which is trying to truth-test some of the claims being made about a buzzed about alternative therapy, we really appreciate the question and answer format. The story calls out some of the key elements, including risks and costs, that are necessary for patients to make informed decisions.

Under previous therapies, none had shown progress.\n\nThis success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nAnorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between 15 and 19 years. Symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient, and a need to control calorie intake and output.\n\nTreatment usually focuses on changing behaviour, but experts say up to 20 percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely.\n\nCommenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia.\n\n“The fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,” they said.\n\n“(This) will go some way towards reassuring patients that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better.”\n\nDBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia.\n\nImplanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said.\n\nFor their study, a team at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada identified an area of the brain known to be important when using DBS in depression.\n\nThey implanted electrodes into the area and connected them to a pulse generator under the skin. The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients’ mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.\n\nThe patients, all women, were aged between 24 and 57 and had had anorexia for between four and 37 years.\n\nInitially all six lost weight, but researchers said this was expected since studies of DBS in patients with depression also found a delay of a few months before treatment starts to work.\n\nThree months after treatment, the weight loss began to reverse in some patients, and after nine months, three patients weighed more than before treatment - the longest period of sustained weight increase since they had become ill. Around half also had better moods and less obsessive-compulsive behaviour.\n\nAndres Lozano, who led the study, said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect, rather than a placebo or hunger-increasing effect.\n\nHe also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were “especially striking” given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies. (Editing by Andrew Roche)']",Unwarranted leaps of faith were taken from a preliminary safety trial in just 6 people.,"Stating that “success” in a study of 6 people “suggests larger trials will confirm effectiveness” is not good journalism.
The harms of the intervention were also largely ignored.
So were the costs.
These are big issues.
Although this piece mentions the pilot nature of the study, the hopeful language and parallels to other therapeutic uses of DBS lead the reader to assume it is likely to work. We don’t know that and won’t for some time.

Cher of SI-BONE, Inc., in San Jose, Calif. (The study was sponsored by SI-BONE, manufacturer of the SIJ implants.)\n\nGood Pain Relief and Other Outcomes with Implant Treatment for SIJ Dysfunction\n\nThe study included 148 patients with low back pain caused by confirmed SIJ dysfunction, treated at 19 US spine surgery clinics. The SIJ connects the central (sacrum) and lateral (ilium) bones of the pelvis. SIJ disruption or osteoarthritis is a common pain condition, estimated to cause 15 to 23 percent of cases of chronic low back pain.\n\nTrial subjects had severe SIJ pain, with an average pain score of 82 on a 0-to-100-point scale. Average pain duration was longer than six years, and about two-thirds of subjects were taking opioid (narcotic) medications. Many had previously received many non-surgical SIJ treatments, and many had a history of prior spinal surgery.\n\nTwo-thirds of subjects were randomly assigned to undergo minimally invasive SIJ fusion. In this procedure, triangular titanium implants were placed through a small incision to stabilize and fuse the SIJ. Procedures were unilateral in most cases, but some subjects underwent bilateral treatment. The remaining subjects received nonsurgical treatments, such as physical therapy, steroid injections and/or radiofrequency ablation of sacral nerve root lateral branches.\n\nPain and other outcomes were compared at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. At 6 months, subjects in the nonsurgical group had the option to ""cross over"" to the implant procedure.\n\nBased on reduction in pain and absence of complications at 6 months, treatment was rated successful in 81 percent of subjects assigned to the SIJ implant procedure, compared to 26 percent with nonsurgical treatment. Average pain score decreased to 30 in the surgical group versus 72 in the nonsurgical group. Seventy-three percent of subjects undergoing the implant procedure had ""clinically significant"" reduction in disability scores, compared to just 14 percent in the nonsurgical group.\n\nAfter one year, subjects assigned to SIJ fusion still had significant reductions in pain and disability, as well as improved quality of life. Thirty-five subjects from the nonsurgical group opted to undergo the implant procedure, with similarly good results. There were only a few complications related to the SIJ implant procedure.\n\nSacroiliac joint dysfunction is a common cause of disabling pain in the lower back, buttocks, or groin. Many different surgical and nonsurgical treatments have been used for this condition, despite a lack of high-quality evidence for their effectiveness.\n\nThe minimally invasive SIJ implant approach evaluated in this trial has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. The study is the first randomized controlled trial to directly compare the results of surgical and nonsurgical treatment for SIJ dysfunction.\n\nThe results show ""clinically and statistically important"" improvements in clinical outcomes for patients undergoing the SIJ implant procedure, according to Dr. Cher and colleagues, with ""profound differences"" between the surgical and nonsurgical groups. The implant procedure is minimally invasive, has few complications, and produces significant and lasting improvements in pain, disability, and quality of life.\n\nThe authors note some important limitations of the trial, including the lack of long-term outcomes in the nonsurgical group due to the high crossover rate. They plan further analyses, including two-year follow-up CT scans and a cost-effectiveness comparison of SIJ fusion versus nonsurgical treatment.\n\n###\n\nClick here to read ""Randomized Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Using Triangular Titanium Implants vs Nonsurgical Management for Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction: 12-Month Outcomes.""\n\nArticle: ""Randomized Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Using Triangular Titanium Implants vs Nonsurgical Management for Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction: 12-Month Outcomes"" (doi: 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000988)\n\nAbout Neurosurgery\n\nNeurosurgery, the Official Journal of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, is your most complete window to the contemporary field of neurosurgery.

The study included 148 patients with chronic low back pain caused by SJD who were treated at 19 U.S. spine surgery clinics.
While the study was funded and staffed by the manufacturers of the implant, the release doesn’t overtly hype the surgical procedure or promote the manufacturer. However, failure to point out the trial design’s potential bias and the inadequate discussion of harms were weaknesses, according to our reviewers.

""We cannot, however, recommend statins for cancer prevention without a positive clinical trial.""\n\nFor the study, Potluri and colleagues collected data on nearly 1 million patients listed in a clinical database from January 2000 to March 2013. The database includes information on cancer and other medical conditions, including high cholesterol. Data on deaths was obtained from the U.K. Office for National Statistics.\n\nAmong the patients in the study, nearly 8,000 had lung cancer, 5,500 had breast cancer, 4,600 had prostate cancer and 4,500 had colon cancer, the researchers found.\n\nAfter adjusting for factors that might play a role in dying, such as age, gender, ethnicity and common causes of death, the researchers found those taking statins lived longer than those who were not taking them.\n\nThe results were to be presented Friday at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Florence, Italy. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nOne expert doesn\'t think sufficient evidence exists yet to take statins to prevent or treat cancer.\n\n""Regardless of whether or not a person has cancer, statin use should be discussed with a health care provider,"" said Eric Jacobs, strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society.\n\n""There is little evidence that statins affect cancer risk or survival, but clear evidence that they can help some people lower risk of heart attacks and strokes,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the American Heart Association for more on statins.']","This story was appropriately cautious in pointing out this was observational data, but it got one important thing wrong, likely stemming from a confusing news release.","This story is about a preliminary report to the European Society of Cardiology. The story asserts that UK scientists analyzed a large health information dataset and found a correlation between taking statin drugs and a reduced likelihood of dying from certain cancers.
However, the story got this correlation wrong. As the news release from the ESC states, the correlation is between “high cholesterol”–not statin use–and a reduced likelihood of dying from certain cancers. This disconnect seems to also stem from the news release, which offers up a misleading headline, and hints later that it’s probably the use of statins in individuals who have high cholesterol that creates this relationship between cholesterol levels and cancer risk. But, crucially, it offers no evidence of that, just conjecture.
Other than this major problem, the story does some things right: It wisely urges caution about the data in its opening sentence, repeats that caution several times, and tried to help readers see the difference between correlation and causation– something we hold dear here. The story used phrases like “the study found an association — but no proof — of prolonged survival” and quoted a scientist saying: “We cannot, however, recommend statins for cancer prevention without a positive clinical trial.”

Dr. Vigneswaran is division director of thoracic surgery and a professor in the department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.\n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma is caused by environmental factors such as exposure to asbestos as well as a genetic predisposition to the cancer. It develops in the pleura, the thin layer of tissue surrounding the lungs. As the tumor grows, it restricts the lungs, typically causing shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss and/or chest discomfort and pain. In PD surgery, the pleura is removed. While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain. Dr. Vigneswaran and colleagues administered a cancer quality-of-life survey known as the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent PD surgery. The median age was 70, with a range of 50 to 88. Prior to surgery, 31 percent of the patients had a performance status score of 0 (fully functional); 65 percent had a performance status score of 1 (able to do light house work or office work); and 4 percent had a performance status of 2 (ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to work). Following surgery, all patients were surveyed at 1 month, 4-5 months, 7-8 months and 10-11 months.\n\nThe quality of life survey measured overall functioning (physical, emotional, cognitive, etc.); general symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain); individual items (shortness of breath, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation and financial difficulties) and overall health.\n\nImproved quality of life was observed in the first month after surgery and was maintained at late follow-up in all patients. Quality of life was not adversely affected by surgery at any time in patients who, prior to surgery, had performance status of 1 or 2; a tumor volume greater than 600 ml. or a type of tumor cell called non-epithelioid.\n\n“The net benefit of pleurectomy and decortication justifies the procedure in the majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma,” Dr. Vigneswaran concluded.\n\nThe study is titled “Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Pleurectomy and Decortication for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.” The surgeries were performed by Dr. Vigneswaran at University of Chicago Medicine, where he practiced before recently joining Loyola.']","<span style=""color: #1a1a1a;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">More information on the possible harms from surgery for mesothelioma would have made this release summarizing a study more complete.<br/>

Although the news release appropriately explains malignant pleural mesothelioma and PD in an easy-to-understand manner, it omits many important details regarding the study’s design and limitations. It describes the benefits of the surgery but does not mention any of its risks and harms. The release also includes sensational language. 
We normally caution against covering studies that have not yet been peer-reviewed and published in a journal, since the findings tend to be preliminary. But if presentations are written about in a news release, we would expect a thorough weighing of the evidence, which was not the case here.

This story about an experimental migraine drug delivered a superficial and imbalanced account of new study results. Leaning heavily on an Amgen news release, the story explains, rather confusingly, that the drug, Aimovig, “reduced episodic migraines by at least half in 30 percent of patients who had failed up to four previous treatments, while 14 percent of placebo patients achieved that goal.”
This result suggests that the drug might be useful for a small number of patients who aren’t helped by other treatments. It also suggests that the majority of such patients won’t benefit from the drug or will only experience a very modest reduction in symptoms. It would have been very helpful to estimate what proportion of migraine sufferers fall into the subpopulation that might stand to benefit.
The story also didn’t provide important information about potential harms of the drug or address limitations of the study, such as its relatively short (3 month) duration. These deficiencies could have been addressed with the inclusion of an independent expert voice; however, the only sources in the story were the trial’s lead researcher and an Amgen executive.

But new, less-invasive treatments are making it easier to remove them painlessly, bypassing a difficult surgical procedure that was often the only option in the past.\n\nAs many as 25% of women and 15% of men suffer from varicose veins; over the age of 50, one out of two people are affected. Heredity plays a part, but obesity, prolonged standing on the job and hormone therapy increase the risks. Sometimes, varicose veins have no signs or symptoms and require no treatment, though doctors may recommend wearing compression stockings and elevating the legs. Exercise can also help relieve pain. But often, varicose veins can be disabling and dangerous, as well as a warning sign of more serious problems in the circulatory system.\n\nWhile vein problems aren\'t related to artery problems—such as those that can cause heart disease—serious complications of varicose veins can include deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot that can travel to the lungs and cause death, and venous ulcers, shallow wounds that develop on the lower leg and can be hard to heal. Veins near the surface of the skin can also rupture and bleed heavily.\n\nValve Trouble\n\nNormally, the heart pumps blood filled with nutrients and oxygen to the entire body through the arteries, and then veins carry the blood from the body back up to the heart. The exact cause of varicose veins isn\'t known, but they develop when one-way valves in the veins that prevent blood from flowing backward stop working properly, so blood pools in the superficial veins under the surface of the skin and causes them to get larger and less elastic.\n\nDarren Schneider, director of the Center for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, says determining the right treatment depends in large part on the size and location of the veins. Patients typically need an ultrasound study to see if there are any blood clots in the deeper vein system, and to assess the function of the valves.\n\nSmaller veins can often be treated with sclerotherapy, which involves injecting a chemical solution into the vein to destroy it, and costs $250 to $500 per treatment. For larger veins, doctors may recommend endovascular procedures, which range in price from $2,500 to $3,000. These involve threading a catheter into the vein and directing a heat source such as a laser or radio-frequency device into the vein to incinerate it.\n\nVein procedures are offered by a range of physicians, including vascular surgeons, dermatologists and cardiologists. Dr. Schneider, trained as both a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist, suggests that patients ask if a doctor is board-certified in a vascular specialty, or what specialized training the doctor has received in vein therapy.\n\nThe Old Way\n\nIn a procedure that dates to the 19th century, varicose veins can be removed by stripping—pulling them out with a wire threaded in through an incision. The surgery can cause bleeding, bruising, nerve injuries, scarring and infection, and legs may have to be wrapped with bandages for several weeks.\n\nWhile some veins may still require stripping surgery, most can be treated with less invasive therapies. Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved an injectable drug for sclerotherapy that has been widely used in Europe for years, polidocanol—sold under the brand name Asclera—for use in the tiniest varicose veins, known as spider veins, and for so-called reticular veins that are one to three millimeters in diameter.\n\nThe drug has a strong safety record, and it also has anesthetic properties, which makes treatments more comfortable for patients, according to Suman Rathbun, director of the vascular medicine program at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City. Although Asclera isn\'t approved to treat large veins, Dr. Rathbun and others are using it off-label for that purpose, converting the liquid into a foam. When injected, Dr., Rathbun says, it fills the vein better than the liquid, which sometimes leaks out, making it less effective.\n\nLaser Procedures\n\nStudies have shown that minimally invasive endovenous laser procedures that use local anesthesia are highly effective for removing the so-called saphenous veins—a large one that runs from the foot to the thigh and a smaller one up the back of the leg behind the knee—and have a high rate of success over time.\n\nNancy Neukam, 67, says she decided to try the procedure because the bulging blue varicose veins in her lower left leg were increasingly unsightly and painful. Though she feared treatment would be painful and difficult, Ms. Neukam took half a Valium and slept, feeling nothing as Baltimore dermatologist Robert Weiss guided a catheter and laser tip into the vein to seal it closed in 40 minutes.\n\nMs. Neukam had to wear compression stockings for three days afterward and had some bruising, but now, she says, ""I play golf and don\'t mind wearing a skirt or Bermuda shorts anymore, and my legs look and feel wonderful.""\n\nMs. Landro is an assistant managing editor for The Wall Street Journal and writes the paper\'s Informed Patient column.

The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the Judith Zwartz Foundation.\n\nThe age-related memory loss and thinking problems of participants in the study who reported eating seafood less than once a week declined more rapidly compared to those who ate at least one seafood meal per week.\n\n""This study helps show that while cognitive abilities naturally decline as part of the normal aging process, there is something that we can do to mitigate this process,"" says Martha Clare Morris, ScD, a Rush nutritional epidemiologist and senior author of the paper.\n\nFour types of seafood, five types of brain function\n\nThe researchers followed 915 people with a mean age of 81.4 years for an average of five years. At study enrollment, none had signs of dementia. The participants were recruited from people already taking part in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a study of residents of more than 40 retirement communities and senior public housing units across northern Illinois, plus older adults identified through church groups and social service agencies.\n\nDuring the course of the study, each person received annual, standardized testing for cognitive ability in five areas -- episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed. The study group also completed annual food frequency questionnaires, allowing the researchers to compare participants\' reported seafood intake with changes in their cognitive abilities as measured by the tests.\n\nThe questionnaires included four types of seafood: tuna sandwiches; fish sticks, fish cakes and fish sandwiches; fresh fish as a main dish; and shrimp, lobster and crab. The participants were divided into two groups: those who ate at least one of those seafood meals per week and those who ate less than one of those seafood meals per week.\n\nParticipants in the higher seafood consumption group ate an average of two seafood meals per week. Those in the lower group ate an average of 0.5 meals per week.\n\nMaking closer associations\n\nSeafood is the direct nutrient source of a type of omega-3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid) that is the main structural component of the brain. While epidemiologic studies have shown the importance of seafood and omega-3 fatty acids in preventing dementia, few prior studies have examined their associations with specific types of cognitive ability.\n\nIn the new Neurology article, the researchers report associations between seafood consumption and two of the areas of cognitive ability that they tested. People who ate more seafood had reduced rates of decline in the semantic memory, which is memory of verbal information. They also had slower rates of decline in a test of perceptual speed, or the ability to quickly compare letters, objects and patterns.\n\nThe study did not find a significant difference in the rate of decline in episodic memory (recollection of personal experiences), working memory (short-term memory used in mental function in the immediate present) and visuospatial ability (comprehension of relationships between objects).\n\nThe results were the same after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect memory and thinking skills, such as education, physical activity, smoking and participating in mentally stimulating activities.\n\nFurther, the protective association of seafood was even stronger among individuals with a common genotype (APOE-ε4) that increases the risk of developing Alzheimer\'s disease. The APOE is a gene involved in cholesterol transport to neurons. About 20 percent of the population carries the APOE-ε4 gene, although not everyone who has the gene will develop Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\n###']",This release provides a measured overview of the study but doesn’t address its weaknesses or quantify benefits.,"The news release is a recap of a recent journal article published in the journal Neurology, and reports that older adults who eat seafood at least once per week saw slower declines in two specific cognitive areas (semantic memory and perceptual speed) than older adults who eat less than one serving of seafood per week.

Peled of Peled Plastic Surgery, San Francisco. He hopes his new technique will ""lower the bar to adoption"" of effective surgical treatment for patients with this debilitating headache condition.\n\nEfficient Approach to Surgery for Chronic Temporal Headache\n\nIn recent years, surgery has emerged as an effective treatment option for selected patients with chronic, severe headaches. Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, these procedures address ""trigger sites"" linked to certain headache patterns.\n\nSevere temporal headaches can result from muscle spasms or enlarged blood vessels putting pressure on specific nerves located on the side of the head--specifically, the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve (ZTBTN) and sometimes the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN). During these operative procedures, surgeons seek to relieve pressure on these nerves or to disconnect the nerves in order to prevent them from triggering future headaches.\n\nThe technique is a new use of an approach that many surgeons are already familiar with: the Gillies incision, used for surgical repair of cheekbone fractures. Dr. Peled found that this short incision, placed in the temple behind the hairline, provides direct access to the ZTBTN and ATN. He describes his initial experience with the new approach in 19 patients.\n\nAll patients had chronic temporal headaches that did not improve with medications. They also had a positive result on preoperative testing--either injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) to temporarily block muscle activity, or local anesthetics to temporarily block the involved nerve. Before and after surgery, headache symptoms were assessed using a standard score, the Migraine Headache Index (MHI).\n\nAs in previous studies, surgery provided significant relief from chronic temporal headaches. Average MHI score decreased from about 132 points before surgery to 52 points afterward. Of the 19 patients, 16 had at least a 50 percent reduction in headache symptoms.\n\nIt\'s unclear why the three remaining patients didn\'t have good improvement, although Dr. Peled notes that two of the three had had temporal headaches for decades before surgery. None of the patients experienced complications, and there was little or no visible scarring.\n\nThe experience supports a growing body of research showing good outcomes with surgery for chronic temporal headaches. Most recently, a study in Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery reported similar results whether the nerve is decompressed or disconnected. However, previous studies have used technically more complex approaches to access the ZTBTN.\n\nThe simplified approach using the Gillies incision combines the advantages of other approaches to chronic temporal headache surgery while minimizing the disadvantages, Dr. Peled believes. He comments, ""This is a straightforward technique and effective procedure that may make it easier for plastic surgeons to adopt and offer surgical options for patients with this debilitating condition.""\n\n###\n\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer.\n\nClick here to read ""A Novel Surgical Approach to Chronic Temporal Headaches.""\n\nArticle: ""A Novel Surgical Approach to Chronic Temporal Headaches"" (doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000002051)\n\nAbout Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\n\nFor more than 60 years, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® (http://journals. lww. com/ plasreconsurg/ ) has been the one consistently excellent reference for every specialist who uses plastic surgery techniques or works in conjunction with a plastic surgeon.

One Simple Step Can Cut the Risk,"['En Español\n\nBy Karen Pallarito\n\nHealthDay Reporter\n\nMONDAY, Oct. 9, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Drinking plenty of water each day may have an unexpected benefit -- staving off urinary tract infections, a new study reports.\n\nYoung women plagued by UTIs who drank an additional 6 cups of water each day were nearly half -- 48 percent -- as likely as a control group to have another infection, the study showed.\n\nThe water group also reduced their use of antibiotics by roughly half -- or 47 percent.\n\nWhat\'s more, the amount of time that passed before a woman\'s next UTI and between recurrent infections was longer in the water group than in the control group.\n\nWomen are more prone to UTIs than men, partly due to their anatomy. A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.\n\nStudy author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it\'s thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.\n\n""Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it\'s been known, at least it\'s been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,"" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn\'t involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake ""substantial,"" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.\n\n""It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,"" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nDr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study ""may be a game changer"" for antibiotic ""stewardship"" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.\n\nShe cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.\n\n""We might not even need to use antibiotics,"" she said.\n\nThe study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.\n\nHalf of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.\n\nThe remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.\n\nThe women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.\n\nOverall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.\n\nBy contrast, the control group\'s total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.\n\nHooton noted that it\'s not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.\n\n""There\'s no magic in a liter-and-a-half,"" he said.\n\nLikewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water. And while the study involved younger women, he said older women who experience recurrent UTIs may benefit from increasing their daily fluid intake as well.\n\nWhether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output, however, is unclear, Wessells noted.\n\n""In addition, the bother associated with the higher urine output, and feasibility of implementing this water intake strategy across a range of occupations and ages, requires further study as well,"" he said.\n\nResearchers presented the findings Saturday at IDWeek 2017, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.\n\nResearch presented at meetings is generally considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed publication.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on UTIs.']",Health care is full of potential conflicts of interest — not even water consumption is off limits.,"Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are a common problem among women, and this story looks at a possible preventative technique: drinking more water. A study conducted in Bulgaria tracked women over a year, half of whom significantly increased the amount of water they drank.
The story was strong on many points, providing plenty of details on how the study was designed and what the outcomes were. However, it missed the mark in one key area: It didn’t disclose that five of the seven researchers either work or consult for Danone, which makes several brands of bottled water.
That’s important context for understanding the research and some of the frothier claims that it’s generating, such as increased water consumption might eliminate the need for antibiotics.

What\'s more, to date the treatment appears to be safe.\n\nThe study authors noted that MS is a progressively debilitating disease that attacks an individual\'s central nervous system, disrupting the normal brain, spinal cord and optic nerve function.\n\nA classic characteristic of the disease is inflammation, which takes the form of brain lesions.\n\nThe immune system\'s T cells have long been implicated in disease progression, but the notion that B cells may also play a major role is relatively new.\n\nWith this new potential target in mind, researchers configured ocrelizumab to specifically focus on a protein (CD20) found on the surface of certain B cells.\n\nTo test the drug, Kappos and his team recruited patients aged 18 to 55 seeking MS treatment in 79 centers in 20 countries.\n\nThe patients were divided into four groups, treated with: a low dose of ocrelizumab (600 milligrams); a high dose of ocrelizumab (2,000 mg); a well-known MS inflammation treatment known as ""intramuscular interferon beta-1a""; or a sugar pill (placebo). After 24 weeks, some of the doses were adjusted.\n\nThe result: at week 24, all of the patients receiving either dose of ocrelizumab fared better in terms of lesion count than either the placebo or standard treatment groups.\n\nThe number of active lesions had dropped 89 percent more among the 600-mg group compared with those getting a placebo. Similarly, those in the 2,000-mg group experienced a 96 percent bigger drop in lesions. What\'s more, relapse rates were much lower among those taking the new drug, in contrast to those taking a placebo.\n\nThe investigators further noted that even eight months after treatment launch, no serious adverse effects were directly attributable to the new drug.\n\nThat said, Dr. Moses Rodriguez, a professor of neurology and immunology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., disputed the premise that ocrelizumab is shaping up as anything new and innovative.\n\n""In fact, there\'s nothing novel about this at all,"" he said. ""There is another drug, called rituximab, that\'s been in early trials for MS for years. And all this new drug is attempting to do is replicate the same that rituximab already does. And I see no major advantage of this drug versus that older drug. It\'s not better or worse. It\'s the same,"" Rodriguez noted.\n\n""So bottom-line, I would not sell this as a major breakthrough in MS,"" cautioned Rodriguez. ""It\'s not.""\n\nFunding for the study was provided by F.

But a milestone study with results published today in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that clot removal up to 24 hours after stroke led to significantly reduced disability for properly selected patients.\n\nThe international multi-center clinical study, known as the DAWN trial, randomly assigned 206 stroke victims who arrived at the hospital within six to 24 hours to either endovascular clot removal therapy, known as thrombectomy, or to standard medical therapy.\n\nThrombectomy involves a catheter placed in the femoral artery and snaked up the aorta and into the cerebral arteries where the clot that is blocking the artery, and causing the neurological symptoms, is retrieved.\n\nAlmost half of the patients (48.6 percent) who had clot removal showed a considerable decrease in disability, meaning they were independent in activities of daily living 90 days after treatment. Only 13.1 percent of the medication group had a similar decrease. There was no difference in mortality or other safety end-points between the two groups.\n\n""These findings could impact countless stroke patients all over the world who often arrive at the hospital after the current six-hour treatment window has closed,"" says co-principal investigator Raul Nogueira, MD, professor of neurology, neurosurgery and radiology at Emory University School of Medicine and director of neuroendovascular service at the Marcus Stroke & Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital.\n\n""When the irreversibly damaged brain area affected by the stroke is small, we see that clot removal can make a significant positive difference, even if performed outside the six-hour window,"" says co-principal investigator Tudor Jovin, MD, director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute. ""However, this does not diminish urgency with which patients must be rushed to the ER in the event of a stroke. The mantra \'time is brain\' still holds true.""\n\nTo select patients for the trial, the researchers used a new approach which used brain imaging and clinical criteria as opposed to just time alone.\n\n""Looking at the physiological state of the brain and evaluating the extent of tissue damage and other clinical factors seems to be a better way to decide if thrombectomy will benefit patients as opposed to adhering to a rigid time window,"" says Nogueira.\n\nThe researchers planned to enroll a maximum of 500 patients over the course of the study period. However, a pre-planned interim review of the treatment effectiveness after 200 patients were enrolled in the trial led the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board overseeing the study to recommend early termination of the trial, based on pre-defined criteria demonstrating that clot removal provided significant clinical benefit in the studied patients.\n\n""Our research and clinical teams are immensely proud of these breakthrough findings, which are so profound they will likely result in a paradigm shift that will not be seen again for many years in the field of stroke therapeutics,"" says Michael Frankel, MD, professor of neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, chief of neurology and director of the Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center for the Grady Health System.\n\nAccording to Frankel, the Emory neuroscience team was a major contributor to the DAWN trial, working at Grady Memorial Hospital, the second leading site of the trial\'s enrollment.\n\nThe DAWN trial included trial locations in the United States, Spain, France, Australia and Canada. The trial was sponsored by Stryker Corporation, a medical technology company that manufactures the clot removal devices used in the study.\n\nThe DAWN trial results were presented at the European Stroke Organization Conference in May.\n\n###']","While the release provides good supporting data, readers should remember that the study was not blinded or placebo controlled which introduces some limitations.","This news release from Emory University describes  findings of a randomized clinical trial that showed  positive outcomes among almost half of stroke patients whose brain blood clots were removed well outside the time frame of six hours currently recommended by stroke experts.
The release properly discloses that the study was funded by a company that makes the clot removing device and quotes investigators from one of the participant investigators not at Emory.
The release could have been stronger had it disclosed details about the patients (such as age, and their co-occurring conditions, race, gender); the size of the population of stroke victims in the U.S. likely to benefit from “late” clot removal; and limitations of the study (e.g. follow up was for 90 days, not long term). Some details on which stroke victims are considered eligible for clot removal within six to 24 hours and the costs of the clot removal procedure itself would have been helpful.

The drug is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is used to detect the FLT3 mutation in patients with AML.\n\n\n\nAML is a rapidly progressing cancer that forms in the bone marrow and results in an increased number of white blood cells in the bloodstream. The National Cancer Institute estimated that approximately 19,930 people would be diagnosed with AML in 2016 and 10,430 were projected to die of the disease.\n\n“Rydapt is the first targeted therapy to treat patients with AML, in combination with chemotherapy,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence. “The ability to detect the gene mutation with a diagnostic test means doctors can identify specific patients who may benefit from this treatment.”\n\nRydapt is a kinase inhibitor that works by blocking several enzymes that promote cell growth. If the FLT3 mutation is detected in blood or bone marrow samples using the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, the patient may be eligible for treatment with Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rydapt for patients with AML were studied in a randomized trial of 717 patients who had not been treated previously for AML. In the trial, patients who received Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy lived longer than patients who received chemotherapy alone, although a specific median survival rate could not be reliably estimated. In addition, patients who received Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy in the trial went longer (median 8.2 months) without certain complications (failure to achieve complete remission within 60 days of starting treatment, progression of leukemia or death) than patients who received chemotherapy alone (median three months).\n\nCommon side effects of Rydapt in patients with AML include low levels of white blood cells with fever (febrile neutropenia), nausea, inflammation of the mucous membranes (mucositis), vomiting, headache, spots on the skin due to bleeding (petechiae), musculoskeletal pain, nosebleeds (epistaxis), device-related infection, high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and upper respiratory tract infection. Rydapt should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to midostaurin or other ingredients in Rydapt. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Rydapt because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby. Patients who experience signs or symptoms of lung damage (pulmonary toxicity) should stop using Rydapt.\n\nRydapt was also approved today for adults with certain types of rare blood disorders (aggressive systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm or mast cell leukemia). Common side effects of Rydapt in these patients include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swelling (edema), musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, constipation, fever, headache and shortness of breath.\n\nThe FDA granted this application Priority Review, Fast Track (for the mastocytosis indication) and Breakthrough Therapy (for the AML indication) designations.\n\nThe FDA granted the approval of Rydapt to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

This release from the Food and Drug Administration announces approval of a new drug, Rydapt (midostaurin), for the treatment of specific acute myeloid leukemia patients who possess certain genetic FLT3 mutations that affect the immune system. It points out that when these patients are identified through the use of a specific test — the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay — then the new drug can be used along with standard chemotherapy until remission and then as a maintenance drug following that.
The descriptions surrounding the benefits of the drug and the evidence are vague. It would have been good to see both absolute and relative benefits included in the release, and a clarification that only about one-third of AML patients will be candidates for this drug treatment.
While there is no mention of the cost of the drug or the test (which FDA releases seldom include), the release provides clear information on harms and how the drug works.

The shot turned off a newly identified cholesterol regulator, PCSK9, which interferes with the liver\'s ability to clear bad cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n\nThe findings were presented Monday at the American Heart Association (AHA) annual meeting in Orlando, Fla. The study was funded by AMG145 manufacturer Amgen Inc.\n\nHigh cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. The first step toward lowering cholesterol is typically lifestyle changes, which include eating a low-fat diet and regular physical activity. For some, medications such as statins must be added to get cholesterol levels where they ought to be. Even this is not enough to get everyone\'s numbers into the safety zone, and not everyone can tolerate currently available medications. An LDL of less than 100 mg/dL of blood is considered optimal.\n\nStudy author Clapton Dias, medical sciences director of clinical pharmacology and early development at Amgen, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said this shot could be given as an add-on to current cholesterol-lowering therapies for people who are not getting as low as they should be or as a standalone treatment for people who can\'t tolerate existing lipid-lowering drugs.\n\n""Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S., and while statins are very effective, a good proportion of people are not meeting their goals, and in this setting the shot could be a valuable addition,"" he said.\n\nThe study included 54 men and two women aged 18 to 45 who did not have elevated cholesterol levels. Participants received one of five doses of the new drug delivered via shot or intravenously or a placebo. Researchers measured LDL cholesterol levels for 85 to 113 days after treatment.\n\nThe new drug did hit its target, PCSK9, and decreased levels of LDL cholesterol by up to 64 percent. There were also decreases seen in levels of total cholesterol and apo-B (tiny fat particles in the blood that also increase the risk for heart disease). Levels of triglycerides and ""good"" HDL cholesterol were not altered by the medication, and there were no serious side effects reported. Now, researchers are testing the new shot in people who have high cholesterol.\n\nCardiologists were cautiously optimistic about the novel therapy.\n\nFormer AHA President Dr. Ralph Sacco said that it is too early to make any predictions about what role, if any, this therapy will have in lowering cholesterol levels, but it could one day fill an important void.\n\n""Even though statins are so effective at lowering cholesterol and reducing risk for heart disease and stroke, they do need to be taken every day and they can have certain side effects in some people,"" said Sacco, who is also chairman of neurology at the University of Miami. Statin side effects can include liver damage and/or muscle pain.\n\n""This new shot may provide a more long-lasting approach, especially if it could be given once a month,"" Sacco said.\n\nDr. Dan Rader, director of preventive cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania, said that PCSK9 is ""the hottest target for new treatments to lower LDL cholesterol."" And these study results will probably fuel that fire, he added.\n\n""A 60-plus percent reduction in LDL with a single dose of this antibody is impressive,"" he said. ""It is the early days, but the data look strong. We now need more data with people who have repeated dosing and are followed for longer periods of time,"" Rader added.\n\n""There are still plenty of people who can\'t achieve adequate LDL levels with existing drugs, including statins,"" he noted. Plus, ""people may find it easier to get a shot every two weeks or monthly than to take a pill every day.""\n\nResearch presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn about existing treatments for high cholesterol at the American Heart Association.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Appropriately measured language in the headline – “Shot Might One Day Help Lower Cholesterol” – in the lead sentence – “Preliminary research suggests …” – and throughout.<br/>
</span>","We liked that this story was cautious about predicting whether or how an experimental new cholesterol-lowering drug called AMG 145 might be useful for preventing heart disease. But there were a few missed opportunities to provide additional context, particularly regarding the cost of the new drug (which will likely be very high) should it ever make it to market and the fact that the outcome measured in this study (LDL cholesterol) is only a marker of heart disease risk that may not reflect a reduction in actual heart attacks.

A team from the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology at Oxford University found that a blood test that looks for antibodies that recognize the protein tenascin-C could reliably show those who will contract the condition.\n\nWhen inflammation occurs in the body, some proteins are altered in a process called citrullination. These altered forms can prompt an immune response from the body, which can see it turning antibodies on itself - causing rheumatoid arthritis. For that reason, tests that spot antibodies to citrullinated proteins are already used to diagnose the disease. While tests for individual proteins usually have a relatively low diagnostic sensitivity, a more general test called CCP, that detects synthetic citrullinated peptides, identifies a lot more RA cases.\n\nLead researcher Dr Anja Schwenzer said: 'We knew that tenascin-C is found at high levels in the joints of people with RA. We decided to see if it could be citrullinated and, if so, whether it was a target for the autoantibodies that attack the body in RA. That might also indicate whether it could be used in tests to indicate the disease.\n\n'When we looked at results from more than 2000 patients we found that testing for antibodies that target citrullinated tenascin-C (cTNC) could diagnose RA in around 50% of cases, including some cases not identified by CCP. It also has a very low rate of false positives - it is 98% accurate at ruling out RA.'\n\nThe Kennedy Institute's Professor Kim Midwood said: 'What is particularly exciting is that when we looked at samples taken from people before their arthritis began, we could see these antibodies to cTNC up to 16 years before the disease occurred - on average the antibodies could be found seven years before the disease appeared.\n\n'This discovery therefore gives us an additional test that can be used to increase the accuracy of the CCP assay and that can predict RA, enabling us to monitor people and spot the disease early. This early detection is key because early treatment is more effective.'\n\nStephen Simpson, Research Director, for Arthritis Research UK said: 'When it comes to rheumatoid arthritis, early diagnosis is key with research showing that there is often a narrow 'window of opportunity' following the onset of symptoms for effective diagnosis and control of disease through treatment. Furthermore, current tests for rheumatoid arthritis are limited in their ability to diagnose disease in different patients. This latest research provides the basis of tests that could improve diagnosis and, importantly, detect disease at a very early stage, with the promise even that people at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis can be followed before the disease begins. This could have great potential to help patients with rheumatoid arthritis get the right treatment early to keep this painful and debilitating condition under control.'\n\n###""]",This release touts the benefits of a test that might find people destined to develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA). But it doesn’t acknowledge the potential downsides of labeling healthy people with “pre-RA.”,"This release from the University of Oxford describes a new blood test that researchers there developed after zeroing in on the protein that collects in the joints of people with rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of the protein can predict the advance of rheumatoid arthritis many years before arthritis symptoms develop, according to the research findings published in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. Among some of the 2,000 individuals who were part of the study, the protein, called tenascin-C, was found as many as 16 years before disease symptoms appeared.
The release does a good job describing the science behind the test but may leave readers wondering, “What’s next?” That’s because we aren’t told when and where the test will be available and there’s no mention of early treatment strategies — what the options are, what they entail, how long it lasts and what it might cost.

Federal regulators require companies to conduct studies proving the effectiveness of such therapies, and monitor them closely. The practice is common for smoking cessation therapies, said Robert West, director of tobacco studies at University College London, who was among the study’s authors. If such studies were funded by the government, which sustains a lot of academic research, taxpayers would bear the burden for what the company would eventually profit from, he said.\n\nStill, some researchers not involved in the study said the topic required more work.\n\n“The approach taken here is a very reasonable one that appears to have been successful,” said Gary A. Giovino, a professor of health behavior at the State University of New York at Buffalo. “But the findings from one study do not make a fact. We need more studies, funded by someone other than the company that makes the product.”\n\nSmoking is the largest cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans a year. The smoking rate has declined substantially since the 1960s, but the pace of decline has slowed in recent years and health experts are trying to figure out how to get more smokers to quit.\n\nAbout 1,500 patients at 61 clinics in the United States and abroad participated in the study. None were willing to quit immediately, but all said they wanted to smoke less and to quit for good within three months. They were randomly assigned to two groups. One got Chantix, the brand name of the drug varenicline, which is taken twice a day by mouth as a pill; the other group got a placebo.']",This was an informative and engaging summary in which we were pleased to see cost information — a feature missing from ,"This story covers a Pfizer-sponsored study that compared Chantix (varenicline) to placebo in a group of smokers who were willing to gradually reduce their cigarette consumption — with the goal being smoking cessation.  The headline is somewhat misleading on that point, and the story never completely clarifies that the participants were willing to start cutting down on cigarettes with an eye toward quitting entirely — they just didn’t want to go “cold turkey.” The story has several strong points, including its discussion of costs.

There are currently two options on the market for men—vasectomy or a condom.\n\nThe research pipeline is full of possibilities, though. Scientists at Columbia University Medical Center have halted sperm production and started it again in mice with no apparent side effects, using a drug that blocks receptors for vitamin A. An injectable synthetic substance, in Phase 3 clinical trials in India, sabotages sperm as they leave the testes and lasts for years.\n\nHormone gels and implants that can make men temporarily infertile are already on the market in the U.S. for other purposes. Nonhormonal methods—removing vital proteins from sperm, thwarting their ability to penetrate eggs or zapping them with ultrasound waves—are being investigated, as well.\n\n""This is the male method moment,"" says Elaine Lissner, director of the nonprofit Male Contraception Information Project, a San Francisco advocacy group. ""The future looks different from the past.""\n\nFinding a safe and effective contraceptive for men has been difficult in part for biological reasons. It would have to be strong enough to halt production of tens of millions of sperm a day, yet not harm libido or sexual function. To improve on vasectomy, it would need to be reversible and have minimal side effects, since men themselves don\'t face the possibility of pregnancy. For example, some female birth-control pills raise the risk of blood clots, but pregnancy carries 10 times that risk, says John Amory, a professor of medicine and specialist in male reproduction at the University of Washington. For a male method, he says, ""the bar is very, very high.""\n\nFunding is an obstacle too. Several drug companies, after initial interest, have pulled back from the area amid concerns about safety and marketability. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the World Health Organization fund much basic research.\n\nYet in surveys, more than 50% of men say they would be willing to use a hormonal contraceptive to relieve female partners of the burden and to exert more control. ""It\'s scary to get that phone call. Or that text message. The one every guy on earth fears,"" says Ezekiel Setne, 20, a University of Southern Indiana premed student who says he\'s had close calls with condoms. ""I would love any effective male birth-control method.""\n\nMale Contraceptives on the Horizon Of a dozen methods being studied, here are three of the most promising. Availability in the U.S. is at least several years away. RISUG (Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance) How it works: A nontoxic polymer is injected in the vas deferens, killing sperm as they pass through. Pros: Nonsurgical; works immediately; lasts 10 years or more; is said to be reversible with another injection. Cons: Requires injection in scrotum; temporary swelling may occur. Status: Undergoing Phase 3 trials in India Hormone combination How it works: Progestin blocks testosterone needed to create sperm; testosterone-replacement restores enough to maintain muscle mass and other benefits. Pros: Uses implants, injections and gels already on U.S. market; noninvasive; reversible Cons: Takes months to work; ineffective in about 10% of men; not available in pill form; may require adjustment to avoid diminished libido, hot flashes or other side effects. Status: Shown effective in many human studies; researchers are testing best delivery modes. Vitamin A How it works: Various approaches interfere with body\'s use of vitamin A, needed to make sperm. Pros: Available in pill form; reversible; nonhormonal; no side effects seen in mice Cons: Early version caused nausea in men drinking alcohol. Status: One version not tested in humans; another seeking to reduce side effects\n\nAdvocates say condoms are, of course, still critical to preventing sexually transmitted disease. ""We hear from women who say, \'I wouldn\'t trust a guy in a bar who says he\'s had that injection\',"" says Ms. Lissner. ""If he\'s a guy in a bar, he should be wearing a condom. This is for your husband or your fiancé, and you should go with him to have it done.""\n\nBig hurdles remain. Ms. Lissner formed the nonprofit Parsemus Foundation to purchase the rights outside India to RISUG (for Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance). It involves injecting a polymer, under local anesthesia, into the vas deferens, the same vessel cut in a vasectomy; the polymer stays in place for years and kills sperm as they pass by. In India, the first men to test it have had it for 20 years, with no pregnancies, except for those who have had it reversed. Reversal is possible with another injection, Ms. Lissner says.\n\nThe Indian clinical trials don\'t meet current Food and Drug Administration standards and need to be redone for the U.S. market. Ms. Lissner hopes to begin U.S. trials next year with possible approval by 2015. The Parsemus Foundation can supply initial funding, but more will be needed, probably from other nonprofits. Drug companies probably couldn\'t profit from RISUG, she says, since it is so long-lasting and would compete with female birth-control pills.\n\nSome experts are more optimistic about methods that block the vitamin A needed to produce sperm in the testes. The Columbia researchers say they need to test their drug—known as BMS-189453—for longer periods in animals before moving to human trials. Meanwhile, Dr. Amory\'s group is studying a vitamin A-blocking drug that was shown to make human males infertile nearly 50 years ago. It also makes men violently ill if they take it and then drink alcohol. University of Washington researchers are searching for another molecule targeting the same sperm-producing enzyme without the nasty side effect.\n\nScientists have repeatedly shown that giving men a combination of testosterone and progestin—the same hormone used in birth control for women—will reduce sperm count and make some 90% of men temporarily infertile. The issue has been finding ways to deliver them conveniently.\n\nMost studies have used injections every few weeks with progestin implants, usually in the upper arm. Researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California-Los Angeles are studying testosterone and progestin gels, used daily.\n\nA new drug that mimics progestin and testosterone in a single daily pill has worked in rabbits. Many experts think nonhormonal options stand a better chance with men—and with drug companies.\n\nMeanwhile, some nonprofits are expressing interest. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has family planning as one of its priorities, is hosting a conference on new contraceptive options with the NICHD in October. Diana Blithe, program coordinator at the NICHD, says given that roughly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned, ""we need to have more options for couples to be able to plan their lives.""\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story delivers a very clear summary of the challenges to finding a safe and effective approach to a male contraceptive, and a clear-eyed summary of some of the leading research candidates.</span>","We are curious about a couple of things.
Why and how were the three methods chosen as “most promising” among a dozen methods mentioned?
Is it coincidence that in the past week many stories have popped up about male contraceptive research, including a somewhat similar piece by Scientific American this same day?

Often, it meant only being able to do one thing at a time, explained the mother of three young children.\n\n\n\nNow, thanks to an implant called Esteem, Merlo can multitask. ""I can make dinner and supervise homework at the same time,"" she said. ""I don\'t have to stop and look directly at the children. I can hear what they\'re saying behind my back.""\n\n\n\nUnlike a hearing aid, which amplifies sounds, Esteem is a prosthetic inner-ear stimulator. ""When I wore a hearing aid, I turned it off when I got home because all the background noise was so agitating,"" said Merlo, 40. ""But I keep (the Esteem) on."" A controller the size of a cellphone enables her to set her Esteem to different environments, such as ""home,"" ""restaurant"" or ""school.""\n\n\n\nMerlo\'s doctor, ear surgeon Sam Marzo of Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, has performed 40 Esteem implants since he was trained by its manufacturer, Envoy Medical Corp. in St. Paul, Minn., in 2010.

(For surgeons outside Chicago, visit envoymedical.com.)\n\n\n\n""This really fills a need for adults with moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss,"" Marzo said. The condition is caused by damage to the inner ear or to nerves from the inner ear to the brain. For patients with profound hearing loss, a cochlear implant is a better option, he said.\n\n\n\n""Esteem is great for people who have used hearing aids but are not happy with them,"" Marzo said. ""Aids require a lot of upkeep and need frequent battery changes. And they amplify all the noise so it\'s hard to filter out background noise.""\n\n\n\nImplanting the Esteem is a three-hour outpatient procedure done under general anesthesia. About two months post-surgery, when internal swelling has subsided, the doctor turns on the device.\n\n\n\n""It is surgery, so there is pain at first,"" Merlo said. ""But within a few days I was comfortable. I had an incision behind my ear, but my hair covers it. Cosmetically, you can\'t see anything now.""\n\n\n\nThe implant is permanent. It contains a battery that must be replaced in about seven years.\n\n\n\nMerlo had Esteem implanted in her left ear in September.

""There are little things that I probably heard when I was younger, before my hearing loss, but I don\'t remember them,"" she said. ""Since I got the implant, they\'re new to me. Branches tapping the windows, the breathing of the horses when I ride, different instruments in my favorite songs. I always loved music but now I can really hear it.""\n\n\n\nThe implant also allows Merlo to hear herself talking. ""That helps my speech,"" she said. ""Now I know if I blur my THs.""\n\n\n\nMerlo said her children no longer have to be her extra ears, telling her when the oven timer beeps or when the doorbell rings.

""This is a very exciting advance.""\n\nThe test, from Genomic Health, aims to help the more than 45,000 American women a year diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. While some doctors consider the tumors to be very early breast cancers, other experts regard them as precancers. Although these tumors are confined to the milk ducts, they have the potential to invade the rest of the breast.\n\nUntil now, however, doctors haven\'t had a good way to tell which cases of DCIS are the most likely to spread, Solin says. Women with the condition often are treated as if they have a more advanced cancer, with lumpectomy and radiation, and sometimes years of hormonal therapies. In the case of DCIS, radiation reduces the risk of developing another tumor in the same breast, but doesn\'t improve survival, says Steve Shak, Genomic Health\'s chief medical officer.\n\nAnd while radiation is generally safe, it can burn the skin and damage the underlying heart and lung tissue, Shak says. Going to radiation treatments also is time-consuming, requiring daily visits for five to seven weeks, Solin says.\n\nThe study shows that about 75% of women fall into the ""low-risk"" category, according to their gene profiles. After 10 years, only 5% of these women developed an invasive cancer — a more serious type that had advanced beyond the milk ducts — in the same breast.\n\nYet 11% of women fell into the ""high-risk"" group. About 19% of these women developed an invasive breast cancer within 10 years.\n\nWomen and their doctors may want to use this information to guide their treatment, Shak says. A similar test for women with early-stage invasive breast cancer has been available since 2004. That test, Oncotype DX, helps predict which patients may be able to skip chemotherapy, contributing to a 20% drop in chemo use, Shak says. Genomic Health plans to make the DCIS test available by the end of the year. Although the gene test isn\'t cheap — its current cost is $4,175 — it could still save money, he says. Radiation therapy can cost more than $21,000.\n\n""For women who really don\'t want radiation therapy or a mastectomy, this might well be a way to determine whether they \'should take the risk,\' "" says surgeon Susan Love, president of the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation. ""It is the first step to being able to figure out which DCIS is important and which is not.""\n\nSome cancer specialists aren\'t ready to change their practice, however. Eric Winer of Boston\'s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who wasn\'t involved in the new study, says he\'d like to see additional studies before using the test to advise patients.\n\n""It makes everyone more comfortable to sit with the data for a little while to understand it, rather than rush out and start using it,"" Winer says. ""People will need to think it through.""\n\nJackie Fox, who was diagnosed with DCIS three years ago, says she welcomes tests that can help women make difficult decisions. Fox, 55, of Omaha, initially hoped to have a lumpectomy and radiation. After the smaller surgeries were unable to completely remove her cancer, however, she agreed to a mastectomy. ""It just seemed so drastic to me, for something that I was told was not life-threatening,"" Fox says. ""If we could reach the point where women didn\'t have to wonder anymore, where they didn\'t have to second-guess, that would be wonderful.""']","This story on a new version of a gene test meant to help women with small breast tumors make treatment decisions provides good context, but it may have obscured a key limitation of the study.","Women diagnosed with small breast tumors known as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) often have to make treatment decisions (including whether to add radiation therapy after surgery) without being certain about how much risk of a recurrence they really face. This story reports the results of a study that compared the genetic profile of tumors to the long-term cancer recurrence rate in a group of women. The story provides multiple views and useful context. However, most readers would likely assume that treatment decisions that incorporate these test results would offer better health outcomes. This story should have clearly stated that this study was not designed to answer that important question and that follow-up trials will be need to document the health effects of using this test.

REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nBut the authors of the study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, stopped short of recommending people take a daily magnesium supplement because their analysis focused on magnesium in food — and it may be another aspect of the food that is responsible for their finding.\n\n“Dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke,” wrote lead author Susanna Larsson, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe results suggest that people eat a healthy diet with “magnesium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains,” she added.\n\nLarsson and her colleagues combed through research databases spanning the last 45 years to find studies that tracked how much magnesium people took and how many of them had a stroke over time.\n\nIn seven studies published in the past 14 years, about 250,000 people in the United States, Europe and Asia were followed for an average of 11.5 years. About 6,500 of them, or three percent, had a stroke in the time they were followed.\n\nFor every extra 100 milligrams of magnesium a person ate per day, their risk of an ischemic stroke — the most common kind, typically caused by a blood clot — fell by nine percent.\n\nThe median magnesium intake for U.S. citizens included in the analysis was 242 milligrams a day. The United States recommends that men and women over age 31 eat 420 and 320 milligrams of magnesium daily, respectively.\n\nMost of the studies allowed the researchers to rule out other factors, such as family history.\n\nBut Larsson told Reuters Health in an email that she could not say whether other aspects of what the people ate partially or entirely explained the finding.\n\nMore in-depth studies are needed before researchers can say that the magnesium was what actually reduced the stroke risk, she added.\n\nOther experts said the results were consistent with dietary recommendations.\n\n“It’s a diet that’s rich in fruits, vegetables and grains. Those are things that have low sodium, high potassium and high magnesium,” said Larry Goldstein, director of the stroke center at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n""It\'s again the diet per se, not any one individual component of the diet.""

One treatment, which is more standard, is an electrical stimulator that calms nerves. The other and less well-understood treatment is shots of Botox (also known by its scientific name, onabotulinumtoxinA) to the same nerves.
The story doesn’t go over-the-top in its characterization of how Botox shots for incontinence could help people, and especially women (who disproportionately deal with the problem). It also hedges the benefits well and discusses the primary potential harm of Botox injections for severe incontinence. However, the story missed some of the nuances about the study’s findings (such as the researchers’ conclusions that the results are of “uncertain clinical importance”).

But people looking to lose a few pounds may not want to go running to the produce aisle just yet. Scientists say there are no major human studies to support the idea that a berry holds the secret to weight loss.\n\nSome new weight-loss supplements, such as one from Swanson Health Products, center, use the Razberi-K brand of raspberry ketones, while others mix the ketones with substances, such as Reserveage Organics\'s Green Coffee Bean Extract, second from left.\n\nRaspberry ketones, the organic compounds that give raspberries their aroma, raised hopes as a weight-loss aid after a 2005 study by Japanese researchers found the ketones boosted fat-burning processes in rat cells in a laboratory as long as those cells were also exposed to a hormone known to help break up fat. The study, funded by a Japanese company developing a diet product no longer on the market, found that mice fed a high-fat diet plus raspberry ketones gained less weight than mice fed the high fat diet alone.\n\nSince you\'d have to eat a lot of raspberries to consume even a small amount of ketones, the compounds are being sold in a number of new weight-loss supplements. Some of the products use ketones extracted from real raspberries. Often they are synthetically manufactured in a laboratory, as is Razberi-K, a branded form of raspberry ketones sold by FHG Corp., in Spring Hill, Tenn., and used in about 30 companies\' products.\n\n""Razberi-K is perfect for those seeking stimulant-free support for a healthy weight-management program,"" says the website of Swanson Health Products Inc. in Fargo, N.D., which uses FHG\'s ingredient in its raspberry-ketone dietary supplement. The capsules, which went on sale last year, cost $3.79 for a month\'s supply of 100-milligram capsules taken twice daily, the company says.\n\nThe growing popularity of raspberry ketones comes despite no major human published studies. ""There is inadequate human data to support the idea that [raspberry ketones] actually cause weight loss,"" say Louis J. Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight-Control Program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York. Substances that cause weight loss in mice rarely end up working in humans, he adds.\n\nNatural Standard Research Collaboration is a scientist-owned group that evaluates natural therapies. In a recently-updated review, it gave raspberry ketones for weight loss a grade of ""C,"" which means the scientific evidence is unclear. ""It has not been well studied or well proven in the data we\'ve uncovered to this point,"" says Catherine Ulbricht, co-founder of the Cambridge, Mass., group.\n\nA study published by a Korean researcher in 2010 found adding raspberry ketones to fat cells in a laboratory stimulated production of adiponectin—touted by some companies as a fat burner. It is true that adiponectin is a beneficial protein, says University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center scientist Philipp E. Scherer, but its main known benefits are reducing the risk of diabetes and helping to redistribute fat away from unhealthy areas, such as the liver and belly.\n\nSo far adiponectin doesn\'t seem helpful in weight loss, he adds, and in fact studies of mice genetically altered to make more adiponectin showed the animals actually gained weight. That doesn\'t mean humans will gain weight if they make more adiponectin. ""The idea that it would actually cause weight loss is probably incorrect,"" says Dr. Scherer.\n\nThe Japanese study states that the chemical structure of raspberry ketones is similar to synephrine, a stimulant. For this reason people with cardiac issues or high blood pressure should avoid them, says Dr. Aronne.\n\nTim Ziegenfuss, who conducted a 10-person monthlong human safety study of Razberi-K, says there were no side effects and none of the subjects reported feeling jittery. Dr. Ziegenfuss declined to provide a copy of the study\'s results for this column. FHG, which funded the study and does business as Integrity Nutraceuticals, also declined to provide a copy. The company says adiponectin is only ""one part of the complex puzzle"" and shouldn\'t be used to determine if the product is effective. FHG said it has had no customer complaints of stimulant-like side effects.\n\nThe Japanese study used synthetic ketones, according to study lead author Chie Morimoto, an associate professor at Matsuyama Shinonome Junior College in Japan. But several companies use natural ketones as a selling point. Simply Raspberry Ketones, a product from JJSmith Group Inc.\'s aProvenProduct.com unit, contains the ""purest natural"" ketones and sells for a suggested retail price of $68 for a month\'s supply of 500 milligram capsules, according to the company\'s website.\n\nSeveral companies mix raspberry ketones with other natural weight-loss remedies that have been studied more. ""We\'re encouraged"" by the raspberry ketone research, says Rob Maru, president of innovation and brand development at Reserveage Organics LLC, in Gainesville, Fla., but ""as a stand-alone it doesn\'t comply with our standards"" for sufficient human research. The company\'s Advanced Solutions Green Coffee Bean Extract with raspberry ketones, costs $34.99 for a month\'s supply.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com']","Maintaining an objective tone, this WSJ piece managed to communicate the silliness of claims being made about raspberry ketone supplements.","Turning to three different experts in the areas of weight loss counseling, natural remedies, and obesity research, this story brought home the point that there is virtually no evidence to support the use of raspberry ketones for weight loss. Even the hypothetical explanation of how these supplements might work doesn’t seem to make much sense.

It included psoriasis patients who were assigned to get monthly injections of briakinumab or to take methotrexate pills weekly.\n\nThe result: The thick, red, flaking skin lesions that are characteristic of psoriasis cleared up in about three times as many patients who got briakinumab as those who got methotrexate.\n\n""This drug has had, in this trial, the highest efficacy we have ever seen with any biologic in psoriasis before,"" says study researcher Kristian Reich, MD.

Results were published November 2 in the Obesity Journal.\n\nWhile the Weight Management Center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes, many people with the condition don\'t live near a specialized program and need help that\'s readily available. O\'Neil said because Weight Watchers has centers all over the country, including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities, its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetes-specific counseling.\n\nThat\'s why he said it was important for MUSC to be involved in the study, which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program, Weight Watchers. Promoting healthy communities is part of MUSC\'s mission.\n\nThe multi-site study\'s results were statistically and clinically significant, O\'Neil said.\n\n""The Weight Watchers people were significantly better off than people who received standard care."" They achieved better control of their blood sugar and lost more weight, he said. They still had diabetes, but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking.\n\nThe study\'s 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctor\'s care for uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. Half got standard care: a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials. The other half went to Weight Watchers meetings, had access to Weight Watchers\' online materials and had two phone consultations and follow-up email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the Weight Watchers plan to help with their diabetes.\n\nParticipants had four follow-up visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes.\n\nAfter a year, people in the Weight Watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight, compared to 2 percent for the standard care group. The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes. Left uncontrolled, the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves, putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It can also cause eye problems, kidney damage and even lead to amputations.\n\nRisk factors for Type 2 diabetes include:\n\nBeing overweight\n\nNot getting enough exercise\n\nBeing 45 or older\n\nHaving a family member with Type 2 diabetes\n\nCertain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk, including African-Americans and Hispanics. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, which is caused by an immune reaction, Type 2 diabetes develops over the course of years. So incremental improvements such as the ones seen in the MUSC-led study are important.\n\n""It wasn\'t a huge, overwhelming difference,"" O\'Neil said. ""But it was scalable, meaning it could be applied to the whole population.""\n\nThe whole population of people with Type 2 diabetes includes more than 20 million Americans. It\'s by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about $85,000 in medical costs.\n\nDiabetes is a growing problem. O\'Neil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012. Weight loss is seen as a good way to slow its progression.\n\nThe MUSC Health Weight Management Center takes a scientific approach to weight loss, focusing on changes in activity levels, behavior, thinking, diet and support systems. O\'Neil said it\'s important to help people, not blame them.\n\nThe Weight Watchers study is new evidence of what that help might include when it comes to a side effect of weight gain: Type 2 diabetes. ""You do have some power and control,"" he said. ""You can lose some weight and lower your blood sugar - and may even be able to change your medications. That\'s no small feat in treating diabetes.""\n\n###']","When weighing benefits and evidence of any intervention, it’s useful to know if there are vested interests behind the claims.","This news release issued by the Medical University of South Carolina describes results of a multi-center study funded by the Weight Watchers corporation to assess the value of its dietary and communal approach to weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes.
Over a year’s time, half of the 563 patients with diabetes and obesity or were overweight in this randomized, partially blinded study received standard care including nutrition counseling and written educational materials. The other half were assigned to attend community-based Weight Watchers meetings, had access to the company’s online educational materials, and also had phone consultations and email contact with special diabetes educators who advised them about how to adapt the Weight Watchers meal plans to their diabetes medications and other factors. The results were statistically significant but very modest: both groups lost modest amounts of weight: 4 percent of body weight in the Weight Watchers group and 2 percent of body weight in the standard-of-care group and similarly small increases in the overall rates of long-term blood sugar control. The release would have been improved had it  disclosed the numerous ties the lead researchers have with the Weight Watchers corporation and some hard numbers to describe the study’s outcomes and the overall small impact of the Weight Watchers program.

She works at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in New York City.\n\nFloaters become more common with age, and although some people simply get used to them, others are bothered by them or their vision is impaired.\n\nThe new research was led by Dr. Chirag Shah and Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston. They explained that, currently, there are three management options for floaters: patient education and observation; surgery; and a laser procedure known as YAG vitreolysis.\n\nHowever, Shah and Heier said there are few published studies on the laser treatment\'s effectiveness in treating floaters.\n\nThe new study involved 52 patients with floaters who received one session of either the YAG laser treatment or a ""sham"" placebo laser treatment.\n\nSix months after treatment, 54 percent of patients in the YAG group reported significantly greater improvement in floater-related visual disturbances, compared with only 9 percent of those in the placebo group.\n\nNineteen patients (53 percent) in the YAG group reported significantly or completely improved symptoms, compared with none of the patients in the placebo group, the researchers added.\n\nThe patients in the YAG group also had improvements in several other measures, including general vision and independence, compared with those in the placebo group, the findings showed.\n\nThere were no differences between the two groups in harmful side effects, according to the study, which was published July 20 in JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\nA limitation of the study was its small size and short follow-up period, the researchers said.

1806,story_reviews_01088,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3946/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,Pills Offer Easier Way to Treat MS,"['A number of new multiple-sclerosis medications are beginning to hit the market that promise to make it easier for patients to control flare-ups of the disease and slow its progression.\n\nThe drugs, designed to be taken orally, represent a new generation of treatment for MS. Currently, people with the disease can choose from a range of drugs that are administered by injection.\n\nPhysicians say many people are reluctant to stick themselves with a needle and would be more comfortable taking a pill once or twice a day. This could encourage a greater number of MS patients to take medication as needed and could spur earlier treatment, which is important since disability from MS is cumulative.\n\nCost of the new drugs is expected to be high. Novartis AG \'s Gilenya, so far the only oral MS drug on the market, is priced at about $48,000 a year; the drugs still being developed are expected to cost about the same. That\'s higher than injectable drugs currently in use, which cost roughly $40,000 a year. Health insurers often pick up most of the expense of MS drugs.\n\nThere is a ""tremendous desire"" among MS patients to begin using oral treatments because of their ease of use, says Joseph Herbert, director of the MS Care Center at NYU Langone Medical Center. Still, he says, many physicians are being cautious about prescribing the oral drugs because their side effects can\'t be fully assessed until they are used widely for an extended period of time.\n\nAmong its side effects, Gilenya can increase a person\'s risk of infection and potentially lead to toxicity of the liver and an eye disease called macular edema, clinical trials have shown. Some of the oral drugs still in development are expected to have somewhat milder side effects.\n\nThe current injectable drugs have generally less severe side effects, including injection-site irritation and flu-like symptoms, although some patients incur more serious problems such as liver damage.\n\nElizabeth Fuchs, an MS patient on Staten Island, N.Y., began taking Gilenya about two months ago. The 49-year-old was diagnosed with MS about 12 years ago and had tried several injectable medications. Avonex, made by Biogen Idec Inc., required weekly intramuscular injections. She later switched to Copaxone, from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which is administered with a daily subcutaneous injection.\n\n""It is just much easier to put a pill in your mouth and take a glass of water,"" Ms. Fuchs says. Not having to inject herself has made her feel more positive about having MS and even allows her to forget she has the disease, she says.\n\nThere is no cure for MS, a chronic, inflammatory condition that occurs when the body\'s immune system attacks its own central nervous system.\n\nMS, which affects about 400,000 people in the U.S., is marked by symptoms such as vision problems, limb numbness and paralysis. Women are more likely to get the disease than men, and genetic factors may make certain individuals more susceptible, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nGilenya, which received Food and Drug Administration approval last fall, is thought to work by reducing the quantity of circulating immune cells that can cause damage in an MS attack. More than 6,500 patients are taking the drug, according to the most recent Novartis data.\n\nRecent data from large clinical trials of other drugs being developed, including Biogen Idec\'s BG-12, Teva Pharmaceutical\'s laquinimod, and teriflunomide, from Sanofi-Aventis SA, show they are also effective at controlling MS flare-ups and slowing the progression of disability from the disease. More data on the drugs are expected later this year and, assuming FDA approval, they could all be on the market in late 2012.\n\nThe success of any of these drugs isn\'t guaranteed. Another oral MS drug, Merck KGaA\'s cladribine, was rejected by U.S. and European regulators earlier this year amid long-term safety-related questions, including an increased cancer rate in patients taking the drug. The company says it remains committed to gaining approval.\n\nAnother drug, Biogen\'s Tysabri, was approved in 2004 but was later temporarily pulled from the market after it was linked to a rare brain infection. Tysabri, administered by intravenous infusion, became available again in 2006 but is limited mainly to patients who don\'t respond to other treatments.\n\nA recent analysis by Novartis showed that Gilenya reduced relapses among MS patients by 54%. Disability progression was reduced by 30%, using a standard measurement of this process.\n\nBiogen\'s BG-12 drug reduced MS flare-ups by a similar amount as Gilenya, but with fewer side effects. Smaller reductions in flare-ups were seen in trials with patients using laquinimod (23%) and teriflunomide (31%).\n\nBy comparison, Avonex, one of the leading injectable drugs, has been shown to reduce MS flare-ups by 32% and disability progression by 37% over two years.\n\nPhysicians say MS cases vary greatly and some drugs won\'t work for certain patients. Also, it is difficult to directly compare two different clinical trials.\n\nNYU\'s Dr. Herbert says it is a challenge to get patients to use prescribed injectable therapies. Oral medications\' ease of use should increase the number of patients who use the drug as required, he says. This also is expected to encourage some patients, especially those in the initial stages of MS, to begin therapy before the disease advances significantly.\n\n""The data certainly suggest that starting therapy earlier does slow down the progression of the disease,"" says Timothy Coetzee, chief research officer for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nDoctors say they aren\'t likely to recommend a patient switch to one of the new oral drugs if an injectable drug currently in use is working. Although the ease of taking a pill, rather than an injection, is important, effectiveness of a given drug takes precedence. Patients who switch treatments run the risk of the new drug not being the right fit for them, says Mayo Clinic neurologist Mark Keegan.\n\nWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@dowjones.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Good job giving perspective on new pills that could replace shots for some patients with multiple sclerosis. </span>","While the headline makes it sound easy, the story gives useful context on just how different patients respond to different medications – both oral and injected.

But working out the unique mutations of each person’s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them.\n\nIn two studies published in the journal Nature, researchers have shown promising results from Phase I clinical trials. While they are very small scale—one was on six participants, the other 13—the findings mean researchers can move ahead with the vaccines, which could potentially lead to new, more effective cancer treatments.\n\nTech & Science Emails and Alerts- Get the best of Newsweek Tech & Science delivered to your inbox\n\nIn the first study, scientists led by Catherine Wu developed a vaccine for people who had been treated for melanoma with surgery, but who had received no other treatment. They sequenced the DNA from the tumors then created a personalized vaccine that contained neoantigens (targets for the immune response) for predicted mutations.\n\nCreative Commons\n\nSix patients were given a full series of vaccinations, including five priming injections and two booster vaccinations. Four of the six had no recurrence of the disease after 25 months.\n\nIn the other study, by Ugur Sahin and colleagues, tested a personalized vaccine based on RNA (an essential link in the production of proteins encoded by DNA). They used a similar approach to Wu and her team to identify the mutations, then tested the vaccine on 13 people who were being treated for melanoma. All participants were found to have a boosted immunity against the antigens specific to their tumors. Eight were still tumor free after 23 months.\n\nBoth vaccines were deemed safe and are expected to be taken forward for further research.\n\nThese vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. Cornelius Melief, from the Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands, said in an accompanying News & Views article that controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trials will be needed to work out if the vaccines are effective. He added, however, that the studies confirm the potential of cancer vaccines.\n\nElizabeth Williams, from the School of Biomedical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology, tells Newsweek the two studies “describe tantalizing complementary and consistent results in Phase 1 trials in melanoma patients using vaccines.""\n\niT@c/Flickr\n\n""The vaccines are personalized for each individual’s tumours by harnessing technologies that enable the comprehensive analysis of the molecular fingerprint of the tumour,” she says. “The data shows that it is a safe and well tolerated strategy that stimulates relevant anti-tumor immune responses.”\n\nHowever, the treatment has its downsides: “As the vaccine therapies are designed and generated specifically for each individual there is a lag time from enrollment to commencement of treatment—approximately four months—which may be too long from some patients with advanced cancer. As technologies and processes continue improve this is likely to be reduced,"" she continues.\n\n“It is still unknown whether these vaccines will extend the survival of cancer patients, or whether they are more effective than other recently developed immunotherapies. Additional clinical trials will be required to determine the utility of these individualised neoepitope vaccines.”\n\nCatherine Pickworth, science communication officer at Cancer Research UK said: “The promising results from these two small, early-stage studies show that personalized cancer vaccines designed to treat skin cancer are safe to use, and that for some patients, they can successfully harness the power of the body’s own immune system to kill cancer cells. The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.”']","Although the two trials profiled in the Newsweek article are phase 1 safety trials, the article barely mentions safety and calls it a breakthrough — quite prematurely.","Ungrounded speculation or reasonable caution? Both are present in this Newsweek story on two very early trials of immunotherapy drugs being developed to protect against melanoma. While the headline calls the research “a cancer breakthrough,” quotes from researchers bring some much-need focus on the studies’ limitations.
These are — after all — phase 1 safety trials with just six volunteers in one and 13 in the other. Far too small a group to make any claims about successful results. The article does tell readers what questions remain about the vaccines (such as do they extend life and how effective are they compared with other treatments), and the type of research studies that are needed to answer these questions. However, noticeably absent from the story is a discussion about the exorbitant price tag associated with immunotherapy.

During the study, more than 26,000 of the 440,000 participants, all with atrial fibrillation, were diagnosed with dementia.\n\nAt the time they joined the study, about half of the participants were taking oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, Eliquis (apixaban), Pradaxa (dabigatran), Savaysa (edoxaban) or Xarelto (rivaroxaban).\n\nThe researchers found that people taking anticoagulants were 29 percent less likely to develop dementia than were those who were not taking the blood thinners.\n\nWhen the researchers focused on people who continued to take the drugs, they found an even larger reduction (48 percent) in the risk for dementia. They also found that the sooner people started taking blood thinners after their diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, the lower their risk for dementia.\n\nAlong with not taking blood thinners, the strongest predictors for dementia were age, Parkinson\'s disease and alcohol abuse, according to the study, published Oct. 25 in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings strongly suggest that blood thinners reduce the risk for dementia in people with atrial fibrillation, but proving that would not be possible, the Swedish researchers said.\n\n""In order to prove this assumption, randomized placebo-controlled trials would be needed, but such studies cannot be done because of ethical reasons,"" researchers Leif Friberg and Marten Rosenqvist, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said in a journal news release. ""It is not possible to give placebo to [atrial fibrillation] patients and then wait for dementia or stroke to occur.""\n\nHowever, the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs, Friberg noted.\n\n""Patients start on oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention but they stop after a few years at an alarmingly high rate,"" he said. ""In the first year, approximately 15 percent stop taking the drugs, then approximately 10 percent each year.""\n\n""If you know that [atrial fibrillation] eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment, I think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on atrial fibrillation.']",Stories based entirely on news releases are likely to present an unbalanced and incomplete portrait of the research.,"A Swedish study of people who take anticoagulants suggests that these drugs are associated with lower rates of dementia. While some limitations of the study were noted, this HealthDay story neglected to mention important details such as the costs of treatment, the magnitude of the treatment effect, and the potential for serious harms such as uncontrolled bleeding. Nor did the story acknowledge the researchers’ ties to numerous drug companies that make anticoagulants.
Many of the shortcomings of this story can be traced back to the news release that apparently sparked it. When reporters don’t dig beyond the information they are provided in a news release, there’s a good chance that they’ll present an unbalanced and incomplete portrait of the research to their readers.

TWO SERVINGS OF FISH TWO SERVINGS OF FISH The American Heart Association recommends at least two servings of fish each week for heart health. Types rich in omega-3 fatty acids are best. These are essential fatty acids that humans get through foods, including fish, nuts and some oils such as canola and flaxseed.\n\n\n\nScientists say the fatty acids are linked to heart health and brain function and may reduce inflammation. Research has shown omega-3 fatty acids decrease the risk of arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats), which can lead to sudden death, and triglyceride levels.\n\n\n\nWHICH FISH SHOULD YOU CHOOSE?\n\n\n\nMost omega-3 rich:\n\n• Salmon\n\n• Mackerel\n\n• Herring\n\n• Lake trout\n\n• Sardines\n\n• Albacore tuna\n\n\n\nLess omega-3 rich:\n\n• Cod\n\n• Haddock\n\n• Catfish\n\n• Sole\n\n\n\nSource: Fadi Nahab, M.D.,\n\nEmory University Hospital The steep rate of death from stroke in a swath of Southern states often referred to as America\'s ""stroke belt"" may be linked to a higher consumption of fried fish in that region, new research suggests. A study published in today\'s Neurology shows people living in the stroke belt — which comprises North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas and Louisiana — eat more fried fish and less non-fried fish than people living in the rest of the country, and African-Americans eat more fried fish than Caucasians. ""Differences in dietary fish consumption, specifically in cooking methods, may be contributing to higher rates of stroke in the stroke belt and also among African Americans,"" says study author Fadi Nahab, medical director for the Stroke Program at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The research, part of a large government-funded study, Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), involved 21,675 participants from across the country; the average age was 65. Of the participants, 21% were from the ""stroke buckle,"" the coastal plain region of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia where stroke mortality rates are even higher than they are in the rest of the stroke belt. Another 34% were from the rest of the stroke belt and 44% were from the other states. Participants were interviewed by phone and then given an in-home physical exam. The questionnaire asked how often they ate oysters, shellfish, tuna, fried fish and non-fried fish. The American Heart Association recommends people eat fish high in omega-3 fatty acids—essential fatty acids humans get through their diet—at least twice a week, baked or grilled but not fried. Fewer than one in four overall ate two or more servings of non-fried fish a week. Stroke belt residents were 32% more likely to eat two or more servings of fried fish each week than those in the rest of the country. African-Americans were more than 3.5 times more likely to eat two or more servings of fried fish each week than Caucasians, with an overall average of about one serving per week of fried fish compared with about half a serving for Caucasians. When it came to eating non-fried fish meals, stroke belt residents ate an average of 1.45 servings per week, compared with 1.63 servings eaten by people elsewhere. ""This is good stuff. It\'s a well-done study, but I think one thing to bear in mind is that it\'s not specifically a study of stroke risk. You\'re looking at a community and seeing how it\'s behaving on the whole,"" says Daniel Labovitz, a stroke neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. ""This study can\'t tell you causation. It can\'t tell you there\'s a direct link between one thing and another, it just tells you they\'re associated,"" says stroke neurologist Victor Urrutia, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. How might eating fried fish impact stroke? It could be that frying the fish leaches out the omega-3s, says Jeremy Lanford, stroke director at Scott & White Healthcare in Roundrock, Texas. Or the increased fat calorie content from the frying oil may contribute to stroke, says author Nahab. He also notes that fish used for frying, such as cod and haddock, tend to be the types lower in healthy fats. More research is needed to tease out whether cooking methods affect stroke risk, Labovitz says. ""In other words, is fried fish a problem, or is it another red herring?"" he says. The study was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Health and Human Services.

He wasn\'t doing his homework. He was being very difficult with his little brother. And he was just melting down day after day,"" Ellison says. ""So I decided to devote a year to trying out different approaches to see if we could make it any better.""\n\nIn recent years, more people have been trying an alternative approach called neurofeedback, a type of therapy intended to teach the brain to stay calm and focused. Neurofeedback is expensive, time consuming and still scientifically unproved. But, there\'s growing evidence that it can help.\n\nEllison says the idea appealed to her immediately.\n\n""Because I was always wary about using meds as a single approach or for very long, it seemed to be an interesting alternative. It\'s really like meditation on steroids,"" says Ellison, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting -- and who has ADHD herself.\n\nEllison has written a book about living with ADHD called Buzz: A Year of Paying Attention. And one chapter of the book is devoted to neurofeedback.\n\nTraining The Brain\n\n\n\nEllison says she tried meditation, but her mind kept wandering. Neurofeedback is better for people with ADHD, she says, because it provides constant feedback during a session, which is usually done in a therapist\'s office.\n\nPeople usually sit in a chair facing a laptop screen. The laptop is connected to electrodes applied to the scalp. Special software monitors the electrical activity in your brain. In particular, it measures rhythmic patterns known as theta and beta waves.\n\nProponents of neurofeedback say these patterns reveal when the brain is in a focused and attentive state. So the computer software looks for desirable brain wave patterns and changes the image on screen to let people know how they are doing.\n\ntoggle caption Catherine Avalone/The Middletown Press\n\nThe image that worked best for Ellison showed a field.\n\n""When my brain responded the way that it was supposed to, the field would burst into color. I\'d hear bird song and beautiful flowers would bloom,"" she says. ""But when I got distracted or when I got a little bit more sped up, the flowers would wilt. It would turn gray, and I\'d know that I needed to work a little bit harder.""\n\nAt first, people can\'t control their brain wave patterns, at least not consciously. But over time, their brains become conditioned to associate certain patterns with pleasant images or sounds -- a reward for good behavior. And our brains like rewards.\n\nThis sort of brain training can take 40 sessions or more, and typically costs thousands of dollars.\n\nPromising But Unproved\n\nEven though there are studies now showing that neurofeedback works for ADHD, all of these studies have serious limitations, researchers say. So the approach remains promising but unproved, says David Rabiner, a researcher at Duke University who writes a newsletter about treatments for ADHD.\n\nConsidering Neurofeedback For ADHD? A growing number of parents see neurofeedback as an appealing alternative to medication to treat their child\'s ADHD. The treatment is relatively simple and painless. First, a practitioner attaches three to 10 electrodes to the child\'s head. Each electrode sprouts a lead, or wire, connecting it to a computer. The child sits in front of a screen displaying images that respond to the child\'s brain activity. When the child has the right kind of brain activity — the images are rewarding or positive, for example — puzzle pieces might fall into place. Proponents say this helps encourage better behavior over time. Cynthia Kerson, executive director of the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, says her sessions with children last about 30 minutes and include breaks. Her own patients might have anywhere from 20 to 40 sessions, but some kids with ADHD struggle to sit still for even one session in the beginning. ""It can be quite frustrating for them,"" she says. Katherine Ellison writes that a course of treatment can cost $3,000 or more. Many highly trained doctors like Kerson offer the treatment, but the field has also attracted people with more dubious backgrounds. ""That\'s a big problem in our field because people can acquire equipment quite easily,"" Kerson says. Kerson said there are a few things parents should look for to ensure their neurofeedback practitioner is a professional. 1. Look for a clinician board certified by the Biofeedback Certification International Alliance who is either a licensed professional specializing in psychological or medical disorders, or working with someone who is. 2. Determine whether the practitioner is a good fit by having your child meet with him or her before agreeing to a treatment plan. 3. Verify that the practitioner is using up-to-date methods and equipment, since the field is changing rapidly. Ask what research backs up practitioner\'s methodology and what kind of training he or she has had. — Whitney Blair Wyckoff\n\n""Parents do need to know that relative to treatments like medication treatment, to behavior therapy, at this point, the research base is not as extensive,"" Rabiner says.\n\nOn the other hand, Rabiner says, neurofeedback may offer something other treatments can\'t.\n\n""The hope for neurofeedback is that after training ends, the benefits that resulted from training will persist -- that in some sense there\'s been more enduring change in the child\'s ability to focus and attend and to regulate their behavior,"" he says.\n\nBut it will take better research to figure out whether neurofeedback can live up to that promise, Rabiner says.\n\n""There has been a need for some time to have the kind of carefully controlled study that would provide more definitive answers for parents and for the field,"" he says.\n\nResearch In Progress\n\nAnd that research appears to be on the way.\n\nA team at The Ohio State University has nearly completed a pilot study of neurofeedback for ADHD that was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nThe team had hoped to announce results last week at a scientific meeting in New York, but Gene Arnold, one of the scientists in charge of the study, says they had to delay that announcement because ""we weren\'t able to get the results analyzed in time,"" he says.\n\nThe results should be out within a few weeks, Arnold says. In the meantime, he says, the study has shown that it is possible to do neurofeedback research that involves a placebo.\n\nThe study used a video game involving race cars. For kids who got neurofeedback, he says, ""The ability to speed up the car and steer it was contingent on maintaining your brain waves in a more favorable ratio.""\n\nBut other children got a placebo -- a race car that paid no attention to their brain waves.\n\nUntil a large study comes along using this sort of approach, parents and consumers will have to decide for themselves whether neurofeedback is worth the time and effort. Katherine Ellison says that for her and for her son, it was.\n\n""What I noticed in my son was not necessarily that he\'d stop losing things at school or do his homework better,"" she says. ""The improvement I saw was that he was easier to live with.""\n\nBut brain training might not be the only reason, Ellison says. She says it might have been because she and her son spent so much time going to all those sessions together, and had pizza together afterward.']","The story’s premise is that there is “growing evidence” that neurofeedback can help people with ADHD. However, the story never follows up with a description of even a single study which backs up this bold contention. We think a story should always substantiate its primary thesis with at least some detailed reference to the supporting research.","The story did accurately portray the overall state of the evidence on neurofeedback for ADHD and emphasized the lack of well controlled studies supporting its effectiveness. It also provided useful information about how to avoid untrained therapists, and was generally good in its approach to the other criteria that we look at.
In the final analysis, the story applied the healthy skepticism which is a hallmark of good journalism to this topic. But a significant flaw at its core makes this story less useful than it could have been and makes us wonder why it was considered newsworthy, since there is apparently no compelling recent research to discuss. It might have been better to wait for the results of the first placebo-controlled study of neurofeedback for children with ADHD (which the story says will be out in just a few weeks) to be published.

The patients (some of whom had been given a low-dose aspirin regimen, while others were not) were tracked for up to 20 years after.\n\nThe authors determined that while the studies were still underway, overall cancer death risk plummeted by 21 percent among those taking low-dose aspirin. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended.\n\nAt five years out, death due to gastrointestinal cancers had sunk by 54 percent among those patients taking low-dose aspirin.\n\nThe protective impact of low-dose aspirin on stomach and colorectal cancer death was not seen until 10 years out, and for prostate cancer, the benefits first appeared 15 years down the road.\n\nTwenty years after first beginning a low-dose aspirin program, death risk dropped by 10 percent among prostate cancer patients; 30 percent among lung cancer patients (although only those with adenocarcinomas, the type typically seen in nonsmokers); 40 percent among colorectal cancer patients; and 60 percent among esophageal cancer patients.\n\nThe potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases.\n\nThey also found that higher doses of aspirin did not appear to boost the protective benefit. And while neither gender nor smoking history appeared to affect the impact of low-dose aspirin, age definitely did: the 20-year risk of death went down more dramatically among older patients.\n\nAnd while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this ""proof of principle,"" the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most.\n\nDr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as ""very significant.""\n\n""[This] is the largest study to show that people who take aspirin for a long period of time have a reduced risk of death from many cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers,"" he noted.\n\n""The take-home message for patients is that if someone is taking low-dose or regular aspirin, it may put them at a reduced risk of death from cancer,"" Arslan added. ""However, if someone is not already taking aspirin they should talk with their physician before starting. Aspirin has risks of side effects, including bleeding and stroke.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on aspirin, visit the National Institutes of Health.']","This story includes a warning that it’s premature to start taking aspirin to fight cancer, but it doesn’t explain to readers why they should wait for more evidence.","This story says many of the right things about a new study indicating that daily low-dose aspirin appears to lower the risk of death from several common types of cancer. It quotes a researcher who said that the findings should not be viewed as reason for everyone to go out and starting taking aspirin. Unfortunately though, the story never explains to readers why the results might not provide a strong enough foundation for such a recommendation, so the call for restraint lacks sufficient heft when compared with enthusiastic description of benefits which were based entirely on relative risk comparisons. The potential for harm was mentioned only the last line of the story and never quantified. This is particularly worrisome considering that the prevention benefit is not realized for many years. Some of the other stories we reviewed gave more weight to the limitations of the data, included more independent voices and a more thorough discussion of potential harms.

Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in other types of lung cancer, and now we’re seeing encouraging improvements in advanced squamous lung cancer, which historically has been very difficult to treat,” said ASCO Expert David Graham, MD, FASCO.\n\nCHICAGO – Initial findings from a randomized phase III clinical trial show that patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) benefit more from initial treatment with PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) and chemotherapy than from chemotherapy alone -- 29% had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. At 12 months, cancer had not worsened in twice as many patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy compared to those who only received chemotherapy. This benefit was observed across all PD-L1 expressing sub-groups.\n\nThe findings will be featured in a press briefing today and presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.\n\n“Until now, there have been few treatment advances for squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Our findings may provide a new potential treatment option for this type of cancer,” said lead study author Robert M. Jotte, MD, PhD, Medical Director and Co-Chair, USON Thoracic Committee, Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers in Denver, CO. “We used to think that chemotherapy just knocked down the patient’s immune system and that it would be irrational to combine it with immunotherapy, but growing research, including this study, shows that chemotherapy can help trigger the immune response to the tumor, helping the immunotherapy treatment work better.”\n\nSquamous NSCLC, which accounts for 25-30% of NSCLCs, is very difficult to treat. Fewer than 15% of people with advanced squamous NSCLC survive a year after diagnosis, and less than 2% survive five years.\n\nRecent studies have also found a benefit of combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy in non-squamous lung cancer. Given those findings, along with the results from this trial, a rapid change in clinical practice is expected, noted Dr. Jotte.\n\nAbout the Study\n\nThe IMpower131 trial enrolled 1,021 patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC. Tumors were tested for PD-L1 expression, but patients were included in the trial regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression level. Patients with EGFR or ALK gene changes in the tumor received targeted treatments before starting therapy on this trial. The study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Outcomes for only two of the groups, however, are being reported in this presentation:\n\nAtezolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel), 343 patients\n\nChemotherapy (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel), 340 patients\n\nOutcome data for the third treatment group, which received atezolizumab with a slightly different chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin and paclitaxel), are not yet available.\n\nKey Findings\n\nIn this study, 29% of all patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression, had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death, compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. Importantly, there was a doubling of progression-free survival (PFS) benefit with this combination: at 12 months, cancer had not worsened in 24.7% patients receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy, compared to 12% of those receiving chemotherapy alone.\n\nImproved progression-free survival was observed in all groups of patients who received immunotherapy and chemotherapy, including those with PD-L1-negative tumors and liver metastases. Overall survival data are not yet mature.\n\nThis is the first phase III trial of an immunotherapy-based combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progression-free survival in advanced squamous NSCLC, according to the authors. Although the difference between treatment groups is modest, a statistically significant improvement shows that, overall, people with advanced squamous lung cancer can benefit when immunotherapy is added to standard treatment, according to the authors.\n\nAlthough the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone (68% vs. 57%), it had a manageable safety profile, consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies. The most common side effects of atezolizumab included skin rash, colitis, and low thyroid hormone.\n\nAt this interim analysis a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit was not observed (median OS was 14 months for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 13.9 months for chemotherapy alone). Researchers are continuing to follow patients and anticipate a subsequent analysis later this year.\n\nNext Steps\n\nMore research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy. The researchers will explore tumor PD-L1 expression and other molecular markers, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), that may predict whether a patient will benefit from this treatment regimen.\n\nThis study received funding from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.\n\nStudy at a Glance\n\nDisease Squamous NSCLC Trial Phase, Type Phase III, Randomized, Global (27 countries) Multicenter (317) Patients on Trial 1,021 all-comer (PD-L1 unselected), chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC Intervention Tested Atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone Primary Finding mPFS 6.3 months with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 5.6 months with chemotherapy alone Secondary Finding(s) 12-month PFS 24.7% with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 12% with chemotherapy alone\n\nView the full abstract.\n\nFor your readers:\n\nView the disclosures for the 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting News Planning Team.\n\nATTRIBUTION TO THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY ANNUAL MEETING IS REQUESTED IN ALL COVERAGE.\n\n###']","While researchers saw slightly slower cancer growth, patients receiving immunotherapy on average felt worse, while not living any longer.","This release about the addition of an immunotherapy drug (atezolizumab, brand name Tecentriq) to chemotherapy for patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer is an exercise in highlighting the most favorable interpretation of trial results that overall showed no survival difference, while burdening patients with higher rates of severe or life-threatening side effects.
The release and an abstract presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting put the spotlight on a 29% “reduced risk of disease worsening or death”… while acknowledging only in the final sentence that there was no evidence of improved overall survival. What’s more, while the release refers to “disease worsening,” what the trial actually measured was “investigator (INV) assessed PFS”, that is, progression-free survival as determined by the researchers, which is not the same as “disease worsening” as reported by patients. Because the release was distributed in the same document with the research abstract, we gave it credit for including information (notably extensive disclosures, along with detailed results) that were not included in the body of the release itself.

Half of the group was assigned to naltrexone and the other half to bupenorphine.\n\nSix percent of those enlisted to use buprenorphine were unable to start their treatment, whereas 28% of those assigned to naltrexone dropped out before starting the therapy.\n\nThat hurdle is attributed to the fact that in order to start naltrexone, a person has to have detoxed or not used opioids for several days, whereas a user can transition from opioids to buprenorphine seamlessly. ""If you\'re currently opiate-dependent ... (naltrexone) takes more work,"" said Dr. Joshua Lee , the lead author of the study, who studies opioid addiction behavior and treatment at New York University.\n\nOnce on either of the medications, people fared equally well. ""They tend to stay on medications about the same rate. They report good outcomes, avoiding heroin use,"" Lee said. However, both groups also reported similar challenges staying with the regimens: Just 40% of patients still used the drugs after 24 weeks.\n\nWhat was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn\'t one-size-fits-all. ""Much like you would expect if the doctor told you \'you have cancer\' or \'you have diabetes,\' then there are different ways you could pursue treatment,"" he said.\n\nThe gold standard of addiction treatment\n\nPublic health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. It combines medication with counseling to help addicts wean off of high opioid use. Public health experts say it can help solve the staggering opioid overdose epidemic.\n\nThis year alone, the CDC estimates that more than 64,000 people have died of drug overdoses, most of them from opioids -- more than the number of American troops lost during the entire Vietnam War . Studies have found that using medicated-assisted treatments can reduce overdose mortality by half.\n\nMethadone may be the best-known form of medicated-assisted treatment, but it requires patients to have the drug administered daily in a clinic. Two other options have become increasingly popular: buprenorphine, which can be taken outside a clinic, and naltrexone, which is administered monthly.\n\nNaltrexone has become become an increasingly popular choice among drug courts . Some say that\'s because of the once-a-month administration, and others say it\'s because it requires that users completely detox before starting the regimen.\n\nUnderstanding addiction\n\n""People need choices,"" said Caleb Banta-Green, a professor at the University of Washington\'s School of Public Health. Banta-Green, who was not involved in the new study, said that getting the right treatment means understanding addiction from a psychological as well as biological perspective.\n\nLegally prescribed opioid drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone work in the same manner as illicit drugs like heroin. They all chemically bind to the opioid receptors in the brain to help dull pain and, in some people, provide euphoria.\n\nThe body also produces natural opioids, but the more narcotics a person takes, the less opioids the body naturally produces. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency.\n\n""To feel normal, they need opiates on those receptors,"" Banta-Green said. Buprenorphine and methadone, which are opioids, work by reducing people\'s cravings. ""They bind to prevent withdrawal, giving some opiate effect,"" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, naltrexone works by chemically blocking those receptors, which is why someone needs to detox before starting the regimen. ""You\'re not getting an opiate effect,"" Banta-Green explained.\n\nIf a person takes an opioid while on naltrexone, it is unlikely they will feel any opioid sensation. If a person is using opioids and takes naltrexone, it can induce a feeling of withdrawal. ""It addresses craving in a different way. The person knows they can\'t use,"" he said.\n\nSo, for example, a person who is actively using opioids and can\'t manage the withdrawals may be better suited for buprenorphine, while someone coming from a facility where he or she has detoxed and who doesn\'t want to use opioids may be better suited for naltrexone.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhat is key, said Dr. Miriam Komaromy, is meeting a patient where they are and understanding what best meets their needs.\n\nAddiction ""is an incredibly deadly disease,"" said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. And as public policymakers, prisons and drug courts play a larger role in treating addiction, public health experts like Komaromy argue that it is imperative to look at ""evidence-based ways instead of having a moralistic view.""\n\nBanta-Green says he talks to a lot of judges who are trying to understand addiction treatment. ""I say this a lot to judges: You can\'t just offer one medication. Just like any other medication, some people are going to feel right with one as opposed to the other.""']",But more needed to be said about the potential harms of the treatments–which carry risks–as well as their general availability and cost.,"Stemming disability and deaths from opioid use disorder is a major public health challenge, and medication has become the treatment of choice to help people with addiction. The study reported in this CNN story compares two available drugs—buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) and naltrexone (Vivitrol)—that can blunt or block cravings and reduce illicit opioid use.
The clinical study found that people with opioid use disorder were far more likely to begin taking one (Suboxone) than the other (Vivitrol), principally because Vivitrol requires patients to have first gone through detoxification. That’s an important difference, the article notes, as effectiveness is more likely if a physician can choose a drug that fits her patient’s circumstances. The story does a nice job of making this point, although it gives less attention to another sobering pattern unearthed by the study: Among the subjects who started the drugs, fewer than half were still taking them six months later. Also, more needed to be said about the potential harms of the medications–both carry risks–as well as their general availability and cost.
We wanted to point out two things with the story that don’t fall within the realm of our review criteria:

Treatment combination shows early promise,"['Philadelphia, PA, April 18, 2017 - In the past, all forms of metastatic prostate cancer have been considered incurable. In recent years, the FDA has approved six drugs for men with metastatic disease, all of which can increase survival. In a study published in Urology®, researchers demonstrate for the first time that an aggressive combination of systemic therapy (drug treatment) with local therapy (surgery and radiation) directed at both the primary tumor and metastasis can eliminate all detectable disease in selected patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nWhile the study is only a first step, one-fifth of the patients treated had no detectable disease, with an undetectable prostate-specific-androgen (PSA) and normal blood testosterone, after 20 months. The results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured; investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate). Such results could not have been achieved with any single therapy alone.\n\nAccording to lead investigator Howard I. Scher, MD, Chief of the Genitourinary Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, ""The sequential use of the three different modalities helped illustrate the role and importance of each in achieving the undetectable PSA with normal testosterone level end point, which represents a \'no-evidence of disease\' status."" Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured.\n\nTwenty men with metastatic prostate cancer, five with extra-pelvic lymph nodal disease and 15 with bone with or without nodal disease, were treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), radical surgery that included a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection as needed, and radiation therapy to visible metastatic lesions in bone. ADT was stopped after a minimum of six months if an undetectable PSA was achieved after combined modality therapy. Other patients were treated continuously.\n\nThe combined treatment regimen including surgery was well tolerated. Matthew J. O\'Shaughnessy, MD, PhD, Urology Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, commented ""While the role of local therapy in metastatic prostate cancer is still under investigation, aggressive resection of visible disease performed by experienced surgeons was critical to the outcome.""\n\nOf the five patients with extra-pelvic lymph node involvement, four achieved an undetectable PSA after ADT and surgery, while the fifth needed radiation to reach this milestone. However, none achieved the primary end point of undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery at 20 months after initiation of therapy with ADT alone, although one patient had a PSA of <.05 ng/mL with a testosterone level of 47 ng/dL at 39 months.\n\nOf the 15 patients with bone metastases, 14 (93%) reached an undetectable PSA when ADT, surgery, and radiation were used. Ultimately, four (27%) achieved the proposed end point, a PSA of <.05 ng/mL and serum testosterone of >150 ng/dL at 20 months after the start of ADT, which remained undetectable in two patients for 27 and 46 months, respectively.\n\nCommenting on the study, Oliver Sartor, MD, Cancer Research, Department of Medicine and Urology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, stated, ""The end point deserves special mention, as the end point of undetectable PSA after testosterone recovery has been previously discussed but rarely studied. The authors proposed that this end point may serve as a first step toward establishing a curative paradigm. Many in the field agree, but note that the longevity of effect is essential to prove the point of curability. Regardless, the movement toward a curative paradigm is much needed and the investigators are to be congratulated for setting forth a paradigm that can be used to assess the possibility of cure in a reasonable period of time.""\n\n""A multimodal treatment strategy for patients who present with disease that is beyond the limits of curability by any single modality enables the evaluation of new approaches in order to prioritize large-scale testing in early stages of advanced disease. The end point also shifts the paradigm from palliation to cure,"" remarked Dr. Scher. It is expected that an upcoming Phase 2 trial will further test this endpoint and combined modality approach.\n\n###']",This release on a small study does not provide enough data to show that the three-pronged treatment studied can “cure” prostate cancer.,"A study in 20 men.  “Cure” in the news release headline.  Talk of a new paradigm after just a Phase I trial.
These were just some of the issues that jumped out at our reviewers from this news release about a study published in the journal Urology. The study evaluated treatment of 20 men with prostate cancer that had metastasized, or spread to other parts of the body.
All of the patients received a combination of pharmaceutical, surgical and radiation treatment with the end goal of having no detectable prostate cancer after 20 months.
The release did an adequate job in describing the study’s novelty and the availability of the different treatment options.
But the headline and opening paragraphs of the release frame the research as a potential “cure” for metastatic prostate cancer, despite concerns, that the release itself notes, about the fact that this is a small, preliminary study in which cancer ultimately appears to have recurred for all of the “successful” patients. Lastly, the release notes that the design of the study allowed researchers to identify which combination of treatments was most effective at eliminating detectable disease.

Expert notes it will probably only be effective for short-term weight loss,"['En Español\n\nBy Dennis Thompson\n\nHealthDay Reporter\n\nWEDNESDAY, July 29, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\'s approval of a temporary, implanted balloon device for weight loss may have many wondering how -- and how well -- it works.\n\nCalled the ReShape Integrated Dual Balloon System, the device consists of two connected balloons filled with saline. The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday.\n\nBut the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n""It\'s going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,"" Roslin said, ""but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity.""\n\n""I don\'t think it\'s going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,"" he added. ""I think it\'s going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly.""\n\nIn a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston.\n\nThe device is available to obese people who often don\'t qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nIt\'s also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said.\n\nDoctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system.\n\nThe device doesn\'t change the stomach\'s natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed.\n\nA pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained.\n\nWith ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient\'s urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device.\n\nNausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce.\n\n""The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,"" Roslin said.\n\nAnother troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial.\n\nRoslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. ""It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,"" he said.\n\nThe balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California.\n\nThe people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said.\n\nIn the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight -- just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on how being overweight or obese affects your health, visit the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.']","This was a reasonably thorough report on a temporary implantable weight loss balloon procedure.  But the intervention raises all sorts of questions about the role of a temporary device, with limited benefits and known harms, for a non-medically necessary procedure.  And the story didn’t address that broader picture. Maybe a followup is in order.","This story describes a device, ReShape, inserted inside the patient’s stomach that appears to help with weight loss on a short-term temporary basis. Besides the gastric ulcers that struck more than one-third of patients in the study group, we think this device also may also represent a “harm” if it encourages patients down a short-term path rather then helping them make a long-term permanent change in their health. The small study described was financed by the device manufacturer.

A small but growing number of hospitals offer the procedure. See photos.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Breast cancer treatment left Susan Wolfe-Tank with an arm too painfully swollen to lift anything heavy or even fit into her usual clothing — a debilitating condition that gets little attention and has no cure.\n\nDesperate, the Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to seek a delicate operation — replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery — as a small but growing number of hospitals offer microsurgical attempts at relief from lymphedema that help some patients but not all.\n\n“Right in this area, feel that — that is your lymph node,” Dr. David Song of MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington told Wolfe-Tank during a recent check-up.\n\nSong, Georgetown’s plastic surgery chief, had removed healthy lymph nodes from Wolfe-Tank’s back and side and implanted them in the affected arm. As the new nodes took root, her arm was shrinking. A delighted Song’s only caution: “Take care of them,” by wearing a compression sleeve as prescribed.\n\n“This isn’t a cure. I will still have to be careful,” said Wolfe-Tank, 51, of Hurley, Wisconsin. But, “I will be able to cross-country ski again, just live a normal life. Look at my arm, it’s incredible.”\n\nLymphedema is a chronic swelling, often in an arm or leg, that in severe cases can be disfiguring, impair mobility, cause disabling pain, harden the skin and lead to infection.\n\nLymph nodes work like biological pumps in a network that’s part of the immune system. They drain watery fluid called lymph that, traveling through tiny channels, brings nutrients to cells and takes away bacteria and waste material. Lose or damage enough lymph nodes or channels in a particular area and that fluid builds up.\n\nThere’s no good count, but millions of Americans are estimated to have some degree of lymphedema, and while it can be hereditary or result from injury, many U.S. cases are a lasting side effect of treatment for a variety of cancers.\n\nConsider breast cancer. While better surgical techniques in recent decades have lowered the risk, experts estimate that still about 6 percent of breast cancer survivors who undergo a “sentinel node biopsy” — removing a few nodes to check for spreading cancer — will develop lymphedema. That risk jumps to about 20 percent for women like Wolfe-Tank who need additional lymph nodes removed because of more advanced cancer. Radiation causes further harm.\n\nYet too often women aren’t warned about symptoms or checked for early signs, when lymphedema is more easily treated, said Dr. Sheldon Feldman of New York’s Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care. He co-authored physician guidelines issued this fall by the American Society of Breast Surgeons on prevention and treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema.\n\nTypical patients have “had that swelling for a while,” Feldman said. “Now the treatment is an uphill battle.”\n\nThe main treatment consists of wearing compression bandages and massage to bring down swelling. A lymphedema specialist initially prescribed a large pump that massaged Wolfe-Tank’s arm for an hour a night, temporarily relieving some of the pain.\n\n“But if I used my arm, I was back to square one,” Wolfe-Tank said. “I didn’t fit into my coat anymore. I live in the snow capital of Wisconsin. I’m not supposed to shovel. We’ve got to fix this.”\n\nWolfe-Tank had struggled for four years when an oncologist recommended lymph node transfer. The rationale: There are more lymph nodes in the body’s trunk than in the limbs — more avenues to drain off fluid — and thus it should be safe to move a few. Hunting for a surgeon, Wolfe-Tank found Song, who transferred about five nodes along with supportive blood vessels and other tissue, hoping they’d grow new channels to drain fluid.\n\nIt’s not the only option. A technique called lymphovenous bypass reroutes lymph-carrying channels, going around damaged or missing nodes to drain into veins instead.\n\nSome surgeons use a variation of that technique protectively, in hopes of preventing lymphedema from forming in the first place. During the initial cancer surgery, they check which lymph-carrying channels the node removal left dangling — and connect them to blood vessels to drain.\n\n“Surgical options offer great potential,” note the breast surgeons’ new guidelines. But they don’t work for everyone.\n\nAbout a third of lymph node transfer patients see some positive effect, Song said.\n\nAnd Feldman noted that over about the past decade, the microsurgeries have been studied only in small research trials, and results vary with surgeon experience. One debate is whether to offer lymph node transfer early, before patients build up as much damage as Wolfe-Tank did. Insurance coverage also varies.\n\nFeldman’s bottom line: Patients considering microsurgery should be evaluated in a comprehensive lymphedema program to determine their best options.\n\nCopyright © 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, written or redistributed.']","This type of surgery is a relatively risky and untested treatment option, and news coverage needs to stress that.","This article describes lymph node transfer surgery, which replaces lymph nodes that were removed or damaged during breast cancer surgery and radiation treatment with nodes from elsewhere on a patient’s body.
The article briefly cautions readers near the end of the story about the limited data and the need for patients to be evaluated by a “comprehensive lymphedema program.” But it doesn’t address costs, potential harms, and the actual number of women who might benefit from this invasive procedure. It also relies on a single anecdote of a Wisconsin woman whose condition rendered her unable to shovel snow or cross-country ski–a degree of severity that doesn’t appear to reflect the experience of most patients.

The examination relies on gadolinium-based contrast agents that need to be injected intravenously.\n\nResearchers recently studied an alternative approach that eliminates the need for contrast agents in some cases by using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measurements derived from MRI. The technique, known as diffusion kurtosis imaging, provides a picture of breast tissue on a microstructural level.\n\n""Diffusion kurtosis imaging has been introduced in DWI to provide important information on tissue structures at a microscopic level,"" said study lead author Sebastian Bickelhaupt, M.D., from the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. ""Since malignant lesions disrupt the tissue structures at this level, diffusion kurtosis might serve as a relevant marker of changes.""\n\nDr. Bickelhaupt, co-lead author Paul Jaeger, M.Sc., and colleagues evaluated a retrospective analysis of data collected from 222 women at two independent study sites. The women had suspicious findings on mammography that were classified under the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) as BI-RADS 4 and 5 breast lesions. A BI-RADS 4 lesion is considered a suspicious abnormality, while a 5 is considered highly suspicious of malignancy. The women underwent DWI followed by biopsy.\n\nFor the analysis, a software algorithm was developed for lesion characterization, and imaging features were extracted using a kurtosis-based radiomics model. Radiomics is a rapidly growing field that enables the extraction of a large amount of quantifiable data from images.\n\nIn an independent test set of 127 women, the radiomics analysis reduced false-positive findings by 70 percent, while detecting 60 of 61 malignant lesions, or 98 percent.\n\n""The model might help to lower the number of BI-RADS 4 lesions suspected of being cancer on the basis of screening mammography while retaining a high sensitivity similar to the sensitivity reported for biopsies themselves,"" Jaeger said.\n\nShould the results hold in larger trials, the model has potential advantages in the clinic beyond its ability to reduce unnecessary biopsies in women with BI-RADS 4 lesions. The software algorithm makes the assessment reader-independent, ensuring that its accuracy is maintained across different imaging facilities.\n\nThe new approach is not intended to replace current contrast-enhanced breast MRI protocols in general, Dr. Bickelhaupt emphasized, but to expand the spectrum of options available for answering specific clinical questions.\n\n""This might also improve the efficiency of reporting,"" he said.\n\n###\n\n""Radiomics Based on Adapted Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Helps to Clarify Most Mammographic Findings Suspicious for Cancer.""

This means that many women are subjected to unnecessary breast biopsy procedures. This news release reports on a study in which the authors argue that false-positives prior to biopsy may be reduced by using a procedure called diffusion kurtosis imaging. This technique relies on information provided by MRIs performed as a supplement to mammograms. Diffusion kurtosis imaging provides information on tissue structures at a microscopic level that can be read via a software algorithm rather than by human technicians. Given that malignant lesions affect tissue structures at this level, it is suggested that this technique might serve as a relevant marker of changes.

1850,story_reviews_00522,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/is-sugar-definitely-toxic/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,"Sugar Is Definitely Toxic, a New Study Says","[""Fat was the food villain these past few decades but sugar is quickly muscling in to take its place. As rates of sugar-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease climb, many experts believe that when Americans rid themselves of fat, they simply replaced it with sugar in all its forms.\n\nBut proving that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. Dr. Robert Lustig, from the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, who has made a name for himself publishing books and research addressing the question of sugar’s effects on the body, wanted clearer answers. Now, in a paper published Tuesday, he and his colleagues believe they have come up with the definitive evidence that sugar, as Lustig says, “is toxic.”\n\nIn most lab studies, the doses of sugar that scientists test are quite high; they want to see what the effect is quickly and, depending on the research, they may not have time to wait to study the more gradual effects that might emerge. And in studies where people reduce the amount of sugar they eat, for instance, those people end up eating fewer calories overall, so it’s difficult to know whether any changes are due to the removal of sugar or to the drop in calories.\n\nLustig and his colleagues think they’ve produced the “hard and fast data that sugar is toxic irrespective of its calories and irrespective of weight.”\n\nMORE: FDA Wants Nutrition Labels to Include More Detail on Added Sugars\n\nLustig’s confidence comes from the unique study, described in Obesity, of 43 Hispanic or African-American children aged eight to 18 years old. He collected detailed food questionnaires from each of the adolescents to get an idea of the average amount of calories they ate per day, then designed a special menu for each of them for nine days that matched the total numbers of calories they would normally eat. The only difference in the nine-day diet was that most of the sugar the children ate was replaced by starch — the overall number of calories remained the same. The children weighed themselves daily, and if they were losing weight, they were told to eat more of the provided food in order to keep their weight the same throughout the study.\n\n“Everything got better,” says Lustig. Some of the children went from being insulin resistant, a precursor state to developing diabetes, in which the body’s insulin levels can no longer keep up with the pace of breaking down sugar that’s coming in from the diet, to insulin sensitive.\n\nMORE: Artificial Sweeteners Aren’t the Answer to Obesity: Here’s Why\n\n“We took chicken teriyaki out, and put turkey hot dogs in. We took sweetened yogurt out, and put baked potato chips in. We took pastries out and put bagels in,” says Lustig. “So there was no change in [the children’s] weight and no change in calories.”\n\nAfter nine days of having their total dietary sugar reduced to 10% of their daily calories, however, they showed improvements in all of these measures. Overall, their fasting blood sugar levels dropped by 53%, along with the amount of insulin their bodies produced since insulin is normally needed to break down carbohydrates and sugars. Their triglyceride and LDL levels also declined and, most importantly, they showed less fat in their liver.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But Lustig relied on the starches to prove a point in a scientific study — that the effect sugar has on the body goes beyond anything connected to its calories and to weight. “I’m not suggesting in any way, shape or form that we gave them healthy food,” he says. “We gave them crappy food, shitty food, processed food — and they still got better. Imagine how much even better they would have gotten if we didn’t substitute and took the sugar out. Then they would have gotten even better yet. That’s the point.”\n\nMORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. Susan Roberts, professor of Nutrition, USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University notes that because some of the children lost weight, it’s still possible that shedding the pounds helped their metabolic measures to improve. She also points out that the children self-reported their initial diet, which can often be inaccurate. “We know that a healthy diet and weight loss cause good metabolic changes, and although this study tries to attribute its effects to low fructose, in fact it is impossible to do that because of the study design.”\n\nSome experts are concerned for other reasons. They’re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue — that overall, we’re eating too much. “Too much calorie intake is still the biggest problem,” says Dr. Mark Corkins, professor of pediatrics at University of Tennessee Health Science Center and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. He notes that the study involved children who were obese already and consuming too many calories. “It’s an important study, and the facts coming out of it are very important. It means we need to look at sugars, and at the type of sugars and sugar intake. But I worry that people are going to hang everything on this when we still need to reduce consumption.”\n\nLustig hopes that won’t happen as more data emerges that details how sugar is altering the body in unhealthy ways outside of its caloric contribution. That wasn’t the subject of the current paper, but he promises follow up studies based on this work that will address that. This study does hint however, at what might be happening. While there has been a lot of attention on the presence of belly fat and its connection to metabolic syndrome, the fact that the children saw improvements in the amount of fat in their liver suggests that might be an important way that sugar is contributing to chronic disease. Obese children and those with diabetes often suffer from fatty liver, a condition normally associated with alcohol abuse but increasingly common among non-drinkers who gain excessive amounts of weight.\n\nThis new view of sugar could change the advice that doctors and government health officials give about eating the sweet stuff. Lustig’s hope is that the information is considered as the U.S. Department of Agriculture finalizes its latest Dietary Guidelines, expected by the end of the year, which delineate recommendations for what, and how much of different types of foods and nutrients Americans should eat.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]","There was room for improvement, but readers who make it the end of this piece should come away with a reasonably thorough understanding of this study’s findings and what they might mean.","This news story reports that a diet study, conducted on 43 overweight minority children and teenagers, is believed by the researchers who did it to definitively prove that sugar — in and of itself — is metabolically toxic regardless of how much or little of it is eaten, and irrespective of the weight of the eaters. It does a solid job of describing the design of the study and discussing why the evidence it provides is qualitatively different from previous research. But we thought the framing of the story was off kilter, as it leads with lots of glowing discussion about the strength and importance of the research, while putting important caveats and limitations far down in the piece. We also think the story could have been more thorough in its discussion of those limitations — including the fact that 43 is a small number of participants, the study was very short in duration, and it had no control group.

""These findings are the first example of a precision therapy that is uniquely effective in a subgroup of patients with treatment-resistant COPD.""\n\nCOPD, a progressive lung disease characterized by airway obstruction and chronic lung inflammation, affects 30 million Americans.\n\n""There is significant variation between patients in the cells and other proteins responsible for lung inflammation, so there are actually many different subtypes of COPD,"" said Sciurba.\n\nOne subgroup called eosinophilic predominant COPD is present in as many as 40 percent of patients and is characterized by elevated levels of a type of white blood cell known as eosinophils, he said.\n\nThe new study reports the results from two Phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of mepolizumab, an antibody treatment that reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood, in moderate to severe treatment-resistant eosinophilic COPD by blocking the pro-inflammatory effects of interleukin-5.\n\nPatients included in the trials were still having flare-ups despite a year of a standard treatment known as ""triple inhaled therapy"" that includes bronchodilators and glucocorticoids.\n\n""These patients already have been given every treatment we have to offer them and are still having flare-ups that significantly interfere with their quality of life and can lead to deterioration in lung function and higher mortality,"" said Sciurba. ""We hoped to be able to offer them an option.""\n\nMepolizumab is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce symptom flare-ups and improve quality of life in eosinophilic asthma.\n\nThe first trial, termed METREX, was conducted at 117 sites in 15 countries from 2014 to 2017. A total of 837 COPD patients were stratified by blood eosinophil counts and randomized to receive either 100 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, delivered under the skin every four weeks for one year.\n\nThe patients with high eosinophil counts who received mepolizumab had a statistically significant 18 percent lower rate of moderate/severe exacerbations (1.4 per year compared to 1.7 per year) than those in the placebo group. The exacerbation rate in the low eosinophil group treated with the biologic did not differ from placebo. The time to the first exacerbation also was higher with mepolizumab than placebo, but only in the high eosinophil group.\n\nIn a second, simultaneous trial, termed METREO, the team assessed the effect of a higher dose of mepolizumab in 675 patients with elevated eosinophil levels. Patients were randomized to receive 100 or 300 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, with the same delivery method and schedule as METREX.\n\nSimilar to METREX, the exacerbation rate was reduced by 20 percent in the high eosinophil group after 100 milligrams of mepolizumab. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose.\n\nAn analysis of data from both trials found that as baseline blood eosinophil counts increased, so did mepolizumab\'s reduction in the annual exacerbation rate. This finding indicates that patients with higher initial eosinophil counts benefited more from mepolizumab than those with lower eosinophil counts, Sciurba said. The safety profile of mepolizumab did not differ from placebo in either trial.\n\n""In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD,"" Sciurba said.\n\nPitt\'s Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine has a legacy of pioneering treatments for lung disease. UPMC also is home to a leading lung transplant program.\n\n""The findings in these trials exemplify what we hope to achieve not only in COPD but across all lung diseases with regards to a precision approach to treatment,"" said division chief, Rama Mallampalli, M.D.\n\n###\n\nFunding for both trials was provided by GlaxoSmithKline, which plans to seek approval from the FDA for the use of mepolizumab in eosinophilic COPD.\n\nAdditional authors on the study are Ian Pavord, F.Med.Sci.

The P-Cure system is based on a diagnostic-quality computed tomography (CT) enabling treatment planning, positioning and treatment delivery for cancer patients in a seated position.\n\nThe P-Cure Patient-Centric solution is a paradigm shifting change from the current method of treatment with the patient in the horizontal position.\n\n“The benefits of treating patients in a seated position include greater patient comfort, less internal organ movement, better saliva drainage and a better position for breathing for asthmatic and other patients experiencing impaired breathing. It may also deliver less collateral radiation to sensitive organs while enabling greater accuracy in proton beam delivery,” said Michael Marash, Ph.D., founder and CEO of P-Cure.\n\nAdult and pediatric patients who will initially benefit from this clinical breakthrough will be those treated for cancers of the lung, breast, chest, the head and neck, and lower torso.\n\nIn addition to the clinical benefits of P-Cure’s solution, there are also significant economic advantages to treating patients in a seated position. With P-Cure, oncologists can develop a compact, gantry-less proton center for significantly less capital and operating costs, essentially making proton therapy more widely available and attainable.\n\nBecause of the high capital costs, proton therapy is currently only available to less than one percent of patients who could potentially benefit from it. The P-Cure gantry-less system significantly reduces many factors associated with proton therapy including the capital cost of equipment and construction, the size of a single room center or multi-room expandable center and the time from center planning to treatment.\n\n“We are excited to receive FDA clearance for our upright imaging technology. We are looking forward to demonstrating the clinical benefits of our Patient-Centric approach for treatment planning, immobilization, adaptive therapy and motion management. The P-Cure team is committed to enabling all oncology centers and hospitals globally to establish cost-effective proton therapy services for the best possible care and cure,” said Dr. Marash.\n\nAbout P-Cure:\n\nP-Cure is the innovative provider of image-guided solutions for better clinical effectiveness of proton therapy at a fraction of the current capital and operating costs. P-Cure continues to develop advanced patient-centric solutions with a focus on adaptive therapy and real time motion management. P-Cure’s first product was cleared by the FDA in 2010.

""The pandemic influenza 2009 gave us the opportunity to evaluate a standard Chinese herb formula"" designed to target the flu, they added.\n\nCao and Wang, who specialize in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology, said the herbal recipe -- known as maxingshigan-yinqiaosan (M-Y) -- is easily accessible throughout China and much less expensive than Tamiflu (oseltamivir).\n\nHowever, finding the medicine in the United States is difficult, if not impossible, given that it contains the stimulant ephedra. The United States has banned or restricted the sale of ephedra products because of concerns about possible complications, such as heart attack, stroke and even death, related to its use as a weight-loss supplement.\n\nThe authors discuss their findings in the Aug. 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 (""swine flu"") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said.\n\nPer World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. However, it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world, such as rural China, where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment.\n\nThe M-Y flu preparation is composed of 12 herbs: ephedrae, zhimu, qinghao, shigao, yinhua, huangqin, chaoxingren, lianqiao, bohe, zhebeimu, niubangzi and gancao.\n\nTo compare the relative effectiveness of M-Y and Tamiflu in treating H1N1 influenza, the authors focused on 410 previously healthy patients who were diagnosed with a ""very mild"" form of the illness.\n\nThe men and women were relatively young, with an average age of 19. They were being treated in 11 different medical facilities across four Chinese provinces during the height of the pandemic, between July and November of 2009, to prevent spreading the flu, not because their symptoms were severe.\n\nWithin 72 hours of the onset of symptoms, the patients were assigned to one of four five-day treatment groups. One group was given 75 milligrams of Tamiflu twice a day in capsule form; a second group received 200 milliliters of M-Y four times a day in liquid form; a third group took the same dosages of Tamiflu and M-Y together; and a fourth group received no treatment.\n\nAll of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards.\n\nThe results: Both M-Y and Tamiflu were effective at eliminating fever, whether administered on their own or in combination.\n\nAll three approaches helped to resolve fever sooner than no intervention whatsoever, the authors said, noting it appeared that fever dissipated fastest when M-Y and Tamiflu were given together. However, none of the treatment methods appeared to be superior in terms of overall viral control, and side effects were minimal in all cases.\n\nEven though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.\n\nDuffy MacKay, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents the dietary supplement industry, believes that fears over ephedra\'s use as a weight-control agent have overlooked ""its more traditional and much safer"" role as a medicine against lung inflammation.\n\nMacKay said that in China, traditional medicine is ""seamlessly integrated"" into everyday medical practice.\n\n""Here in the U.S., we do things differently,"" he said. ""We have our prescription drugs on the one hand, and then we have dietary supplements on the other.""\n\nBut, MacKay continued, ""it should also be understood that these two treatments actually work very differently.

It also lacked crucial context that a truly independent observer might have provided — specifically, that the patients included in the study (healthy adults with very mild cases) are not the kind of people for whom Tamiflu makes a big difference, as these patients typically get better quickly on their own without treatment. What’s truly needed is an alternative treatment for patients with severe cases who don’t have access to antiviral drugs.

But a team of researchers from the University of Cincinnati set out to explore other treatment options that focus more on the mind and less on pharmaceutical solutions.\n\nTheir study, published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, recruited nine participants who were diagnosed with anxiety disorders between 9 and 16 years of age. These conditions included generalized, social, and separation anxiety disorder as well as having a parent with bipolar disorder. Over the course of 12 weeks, each participant underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while they practiced mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, a wide range of theraputic techiniques that include meditation, yoga, and learning how to pay nonjudgmental attention to one\'s life.\n\n""These integrative approaches expand traditional treatments and offer new strategies for coping with psychological distress,” said the study’s co-author Sian Cotton, director of the UC\'s Center for Integrative Health and Wellness, in a statement. ""Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions promote the use of meditative practices to increase present-moment awareness of conscious thoughts, feelings, and body sensations in an effort to manage negative experiences more effectively.”\n\nPhoto courtesy of Pixabay, public domain\n\nChildren who are at a high risk for bipolar disorder or other anxiety disorders, such as the participants, often have poor coping skills when confronted by stress, and only a lucky few get help. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 80 percent of children with a diagnosed anxiety disorder and 60 percent of those diagnosed with depression do not receive treatment. Some mental health professionals have suggested that mindfulness exercises can help bridge the treatment gap, and there is some encouraging, if early, evidence showing that these techniques can be used to prevent relapses of depression or anxiety.\n\nCotton noted the anxiety of their patients was significantly reduced following treatment, and the more mindfulness they practiced, the less anxious they felt. Both findings reaffirm the potential that mindfulness therapy could bring to the table. If nothing else, it might allow people who would be reluctant to take medication more treatments to choose from. ""Increasingly, patients and families are asking for additional therapeutic options, in addition to traditional medication-based treatments, that have proven effectiveness for improved symptom reduction. Mindfulness-based therapies for mood disorders is one such example with promising evidence,"" said Cotton, adding the university is both studying and implenting these therapies.\n\nAfter the 12-week experiment, Cotton and his colleagues found mindfulness therapy increased neural activity in a part of the brain that plays in a role in processing cognitive and emotion information known as the cingulate. The therapy was also able to increase brain activity in the insula, a part of the brain that helps monitor how the body feels psychologically.\n\n""This raises the possibility that treatment-related increases in brain activity during emotional processing may improve emotional processing in anxious youth who are at risk for developing bipolar disorder,” said fellow co-author Dr. Jeffrey Strawn, a professor in UC\'s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, as well as director of the Anxiety Disorders Research Program, in a statement. ""The path from understanding the effects of psychotherapy on brain activity to the identification of treatment response is a challenging one, and will require additional studies of emotional processing circuits.”\n\nSource: Strawn JR, Cotton S, Luberto CM, et al.

The story reports that the study found cognitive therapy was effective at reducing anxiety in study participants. The story does a good job of highlighting that these findings are preliminary, and that additional research is needed to determine how effective cognitive therapy may be as a treatment option for the general population. However, the story does not discuss the extent of the therapy’s benefits in this study, the availability and cost of such cognitive therapy for children, or whether the study participants were also being treated with medications while undergoing cognitive therapy. The story also appears to draw heavily on a news release, and does not incorporate input from independent experts.

Patel, MD, a neurosurgeon at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, U.K., and an author of the case study.\n\nPatel says that makes the impact of the case study “startling and exciting” because if studies bear the findings out, deep brain stimulation may one day help people with hypertension whose blood pressure remains uncontrolled on multiple medications.\n\nThe case study is published in the Jan. 25 issue of Neurology.\n\nWhile the case study is only an example of the phenomenon occurring in a single person, previous reports have observed the same kinds of reductions in blood pressure in people getting deep brain stimulation for pain, though researchers had believed that the blood pressure benefit was directly tied to the degree of pain relief the person experienced.\n\n“What their case report shows is that blood pressure can be reduced in a sustained fashion in a patient with unsuccessful deep brain stimulation for pain,” says Erlick Pereira, MD, a neurosurgeon at the University of Oxford. Pereira wrote about blood pressure reductions in a patient getting deep brain stimulation in the January 2010 issue of the Journal of Clinical Neuroscience.\n\n“I think that’s important because it paves the way for potentially studying patients without chronic pain and offering the treatment sometime in the future to reduce blood pressure,” he says.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This 1,000-word WebMD story was more detailed than its 440-word <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3566"" target=""_blank"">HealthDay counterpart</a> on the same topic, but the extra length didn’t seem to help the story satisfy any more of our criteria. </span>","In describing why researchers think deep brain stimulation (DBS) might one day be a treatment option for patients with difficult-to-treat high blood pressure, the story didn’t adequately caution that the excitement is based on a case report from a single patient.

The observational study referenced in this news release suggests that people who have bariatric surgery may have a lower rate of death than those who try to lose weight using nonsurgical alternatives.
Although the study is larger than many similar ones, it suffers from some of the same limitations; mainly difficulties matching the two study groups in such a way that the differences in their outcomes can be attributed to something other than chance.
This news release does touch on these limitations but would have served readers better if it had included more on the costs and risks involved in bariatric surgery, as well as some discussion of nonsurgical alternatives.

According to a study published in the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the official medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists® (ASA®), patients who received a novel high frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy experienced significantly greater, long-term relief for both chronic back and leg pain, when compared to a traditional low frequency form of SCS therapy.“This is the first long-term study to compare the safety and effectiveness of high frequency and traditional SCS therapy for back and leg pain,” said Leonardo Kapural, M.D., lead study author and professor of anesthesiology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and clinical director at Carolinas Pain Institute at Brookstown in Winston-Salem, N.C. “Chronic back and leg pain have long been considered difficult to treat and current pain relief options such as opioids have limited effectiveness and commonly known side effects. Given the prevalence of chronic pain, high frequency SCS is an exciting advance for our patients.”\n\n\n\nSCS is an increasingly common therapy that delivers electric pulses to the spinal cord, through a small device implanted under the skin, for difficult to treat chronic pain in the trunk and limbs. SCS is reversible and is an important option for chronic pain sufferers who otherwise would rely on opioids or back surgery for relief. The new treatment, called HF10™ therapy, uses proprietary high frequency pulses of 10,000 Hz, compared to traditional SCS which uses frequencies of 40 to 60 Hz. HF10 therapy also provides pain relief without paresthesia – a stimulation-induced sensation commonly perceived as tingling or buzzing, which masks a patient’s perception of pain – typical of traditional SCS. These sensations are often distracting or uncomfortable to patients and limit the utility and acceptance of traditional devices. Identifying a new intervention that does not rely on paresthesia to mask pain is novel to SCS and has the potential to improve pain relief and quality of life for these complex patients. In the study, researchers examined 171 patients with chronic back or leg pain who were implanted at 10 comprehensive pain treatment centers. Of these, 90 patients received HF10 therapy, while 81 patients had traditional SCS.\n\n\n\nAt three months, 85 percent of back pain and 83 percent of leg pain patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain or greater. Conversely, only 44 percent of back pain and 56 percent of leg pain patients in the traditional SCS group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain. None of the patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced paresthesia. HF10 therapy remained more effective than traditional SCS over the 12 month study period. More patients in the HF10 therapy group reported being “very satisfied” with their pain relief (55 percent versus 32 percent). More than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with lower back pain being the most frequent condition affecting 23 to 26 percent of the population.\n\n\n\nTHE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS\n\n\n\nFounded in 1905, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is an educational, research and scientific society with more than 52,000 members organized to raise and maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology. ASA is committed to ensuring that physician anesthesiologists evaluate and supervise the medical care of patients before, during, and after surgery to provide the highest quality and safest care that every patient deserves.\n\n\n\nFor more information on the field of anesthesiology, visit the American Society of Anesthesiologists online at asahq.org. To learn more about the role physician anesthesiologists play in ensuring patient safety, visit asahq.org/WhenSecondsCount.\n\n\n\n# # #\n\n\n\n']",This news release focused exclusively on benefits and advantages of the new device that was tested — the HF10 — but doesn’t mention drawbacks. There’s also a suggestion that patients only have 2 other options besides this device–surgery or narcotics–which is misleading.,"The release reports on a study that tested a new type of implanted device for the treatment of chronic back and leg pain. It uses high-frequency electrical pulses, delivered directly to the spinal cord via implanted leads. The study compared this high-frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to a more traditional approach that uses lower-frequency pulses. The main advantage of the new approach, according to the release, is that patients don’t feel an annoying tingling or buzzing sensation that’s associated with the traditional approach.
The release faithfully reports the outlines of the study in broad strokes and provides some of the outcomes in user-friendly terms. But there a lot of missing context that any reporter relying on the release should have been given. Notably, this was a company funded study run by investigators with close ties to the manufacturer of the device. The surgery required to implant the device can cause harms that weren’t mentioned. Finally, it’s not clear if this device is approved for use and if so, how much would it cost to have it implanted and would insurance cover that cost?

Making it worse for many patients, there hasn\'t been a conclusive test to diagnose what\'s wrong with them. Without proof of a physical cause, some doctors considered IBS a psychological disorder.\n\nBut that could finally change with the introduction of two simple new blood tests for spotting the disease. Dr. Mark Pimentel of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles developed the tests.\n\n""We now have a test to say, you have a disease,"" Pimentel told CBS News. ""Having a test like this shortens the time of suffering, it shortens the time of investigation and accelerates getting the patient directly to treatment.""\n\nNew tests for common gastrointestinal disorder\n\nThe tests, which measure antibodies in the blood, were based on research suggesting that IBS may develop after infection from a bacterial toxin found in food poisoning. Researchers believe the toxin triggers the immune system to attack a person\'s intestinal tract long after the toxin is gone.\n\nIrina Obenauer was diagnosed with IBS years ago after suffering from diarrhea and bloating, but it took doctors a long time to rule out other possible diagnoses first.\n\n""There\'s always kind of a \'trend of the week\' that you had to go and get tested for and rule out, and at the end of the day you don\'t feel better,"" she said.\n\nShe got the new blood test to confirm her diagnosis, and when it came back positive, she said she felt a sense of relief knowing IBS wasn\'t all in her head.\n\n""I\'m not saying the symptoms went away,"" she said, but she ""started to feel more whole.""\n\nCBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, who is also a practicing internist and gastroenterologist, points out that the test is not perfect. While a positive test result is highly suggestive of IBS, only 44 percent of patients with IBS tested positive, meaning that many people who test negative could in fact still have the condition.']",This story has many of the same problems as the news release ,"
A new test to help determine a more definitive diagnosis for people who suffer from gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and bloating would be a very good thing.  Seeing as millions of people around the world suffer from uncomfortable and embarrassing symptoms that might be related to an irritable bowel, a better test to diagnose the condition could have far reaching implications. Unfortunately this story struck out on almost all counts — lacking detail on current ways to diagnose IBS, giving no sense of the magnitude of benefits or harms, and ultimately failing to deliver an adequate explanation of how patients would be better off if they receive a more definitive diagnosis of IBS. These shortcomings are similar to those of the news release that likely prompted the story, and which we also subjected to a systematic review.

Lahita, chairman of medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey, told FoxNews.com. “Heating ducts that have mold and spores in them can make respiratory symptoms worse in the winter when hot air is blowing through them. Dry air can also exacerbate some illnesses and can be a problem as well.”\n\nDifferent sources of air pollution in your home could include paints that release lead or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carpets that harbor dirt, dust mites, and fungus and even nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, but these aren’t the worst culprits, Lahita said.\n\n“In the winter the biggest issue is carbon monoxide poisoning, with emergency medical services we see a few of these every year-- it is from faulty heaters, cooking without ventilation or fireplaces,” he said.\n\nEvery room in your house could be susceptive to some form of an air pollutant, but now there is a new device and app that says it can help you breathe easier by tracking air quality.\n\nAwair is the first smart air quality device that monitors, analyzes and provides feedback to improve the air you breathe. The device collects data such as indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, fine dust particles and VOCs. It analyzes the data in real-time and gives an Awair score on a 0 to 100 color-coded scale, 0 being the worst air quality.\n\n“The goal for the user is to keep five green dots. As soon as you see other colored (amber and red) dots show up on top of the green dots, your environment is getting off the healthy ranges whether it being temperature, humidity, CO2, VOCs, and dust,” Ronald Ro, the CEO and co-founder of Bitfinder Inc., the makers of Awair, told FoxNews.com.\n\nBased on your air score, the monitoring gadget will send personalized alerts and advice to the user via its corresponding Awair mobile app. When air conditions are harmful, like when a bedroom has a high carbon dioxide level, it will send a notification to the user and advise them to open up a window through the app. The app also provides Mayo Clinic “message cards” that give relevant information and recommendations for ways to keep your indoor environment healthy.\n\nIf you already have a smart device system for your home, Awair is working on partnerships with several connected devices like Nest thermostat and other smart appliances so you can manage the air quality in your home or office when you're not there.\n\nThe Awair app is free to download, but each device costs $199 dollars.\n\nFor more information go to GetAwair.com.""]",This story’s lack of quantified benefits — or any information about how accurate the device is — make it read more like a paid promotion than a news article.,"The story describes a device and related mobile app, called Awair, that monitors air quality in the home and reports the information to users.

Try Eating a Mediterranean Diet,"['Newswise — Eating a Mediterranean diet can slow down cognitive decline.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet can improve your mind, as well your heart, shows a study published in the open-access journal Frontiers in Nutrition.\n\nBy sticking to the Mediterranean diet the study showed that people had slowed rates of cognitive decline, reduced conversion to Alzheimer\'s, and improved cognitive function.\n\nThe main foods in the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) include plant foods, such as leafy greens, fresh fruit and vegetables, cereals, beans, seeds, nuts, and legumes. The MedDiet is also low in dairy, has minimal red meat, and uses olive oil as its major source of fat.\n\nLeading author Roy Hardman from the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology Swinburne University of Technology Melbourne Australia and his colleagues evaluated all the available papers between 2000-2015 that investigated if and how a MedDiet may impact cognitive processes over time. In total, 18 out of the 135 articles met their strict inclusion criteria.\n\n""The most surprising result was that the positive effects were found in countries around the whole world. So regardless of being located outside of what is considered the Mediterranean region, the positive cognitive effects of a higher adherence to a MedDiet were similar in all evaluated papers;"" he said.\n\nAttention, memory, and language improved. Memory, in particular, was positively affected by the MedDiet including improvements in: delayed recognition, long-term, and working memory, executive function, and visual constructs.\n\n""Why is a higher adherence to the MedDiet related to slowing down the rate of cognitive decline? The MedDiet offers the opportunity to change some of the modifiable risk factors,"" he explained.\n\n""These include reducing inflammatory responses, increasing micronutrients, improving vitamin and mineral imbalances, changing lipid profiles by using olive oils as the main source of dietary fats, maintaining weight and potentially reducing obesity, improving polyphenols in the blood, improving cellular energy metabolism and maybe changing the gut micro-biota, although this has not been examined to a larger extent yet.""\n\nMoreover, the benefits to cognition afforded by the MedDiet were not exclusive to older individuals. Two of the included studies focused on younger adults and they both found improvements in cognition using computerized assessments.\n\nThe researchers stress that research in this area is important due to the expected extensive population aging over the next 20-30 years. They envision that the utilization of a dietary pattern, such as the MedDiet, will be an essential tool to maintain quality of life and reduce the potential social and economic burdens of manifested cognitive declines like dementia.\n\n""I would therefore recommend people to try to adhere or switch to a MedDiet, even at an older age,"" Hardman added.\n\nLike many researchers, Hardman takes his research home: ""I follow the diet patterns and do not eat any red meats, chicken or pork. I have fish two-three times per week and adhere to a Mediterranean style of eating.""\n\nSEE ORIGINAL STUDY']","Devoid of quantification, this diet release lacks meat.","A review of a small number of studies examining impacts of the Mediterranean Diet finds that the diet is associated with both cognitive improvements and slower cognitive decline. The study is laudable in that it seeks to capture a bit of the “big picture” by examining the results of many studies, and focusing on 18 studies that met the researchers’ criteria for inclusion.
The challenges of pinning down the effects of diet are well known (see, for example, a recent article in the New York Times reflecting on these issues) so determining the actual benefits of the Mediterranean diet will take time and careful analysis. This news release is far more convinced of that linkage than is warranted.

But the fact that the fewest recurrences were seen in men who took the highest statin doses is compelling, says senior investigator Stephen J. Freedland, MD, of the Duke Prostate Center.\n\n“Statin users may see their doctors more often and may be more health conscious in general, and it has been suggested that this could explain the observed reduction in risk,” Freedland tells WebMD. “If this is the case, dosage shouldn’t matter. But that is not what we found.”']","An observational study can’t prove cause and effect, so it is misleading and inaccurate for the headline to blare about protection.  You can’t prove protection when you can’t prove cause and effect.  And the ""may"" qualifier doesn’t go far enough.

This research shows that eating whole grains reduces the risk of heart disease,"" said John Kirwan, Ph.D., principal investigator and director of the Metabolic Translational Research Center, which is part of Cleveland Clinic\'s Endocrinology & Metabolism Institute.\n\nResearchers conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover trial. In the study, a group of 33 overweight and obese adults followed a whole grain diet (intervention) or a refined grain diet (control) for two eight-week periods. The diets were exactly the same, except for their content of whole grains or refined grains. At the beginning and end of each diet period, participants spent three days undergoing metabolic testing in a clinical research setting. Participants taking antihypertensive medication were instructed to maintain medication usage throughout the study.\n\nWhile on the whole grain diet, participants saw a three-fold improvement in diastolic blood pressure (the lowest pressure when your heart relaxes between beats) compared to the refined grain diet. This improvement equates to reducing the risk of death from heart disease by almost one-third, and the risk of death from a stroke by two-fifths.\n\n""The uniqueness of this study is that each of the 33 participants consumed both diets,"" said Kirwan. ""This level of control can only be performed for small numbers and provides the essential empirical data that cannot be obtained from large observational studies. These evidence-based data demonstrate the effect of diet on cardiovascular disease outcomes, particularly diastolic blood pressure.""\n\nBlood pressure is typically recorded as two numbers. Systolic is the top number that measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats. Diastolic is the bottom number, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle is resting between heartbeats.\n\nHypertension - or high blood pressure - is a common obesity-related condition that affects about 30 percent of U.S. adults and it is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Before age 50, an elevated diastolic blood pressure is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. As they age, people with elevated diastolic blood pressure are at a higher-than-average risk of developing elevated systolic blood pressure.\n\nOverall, there were substantial reductions in body weight, fat loss, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol during both diet periods, but these differences were due to the people changing their normal dietary habits to carefully controlled diets.\n\n###\n\nThis collaborative research began in 2010. It was supported by an investigator-initiated grant from Nestlé, NIH National Center for Research Resources Grant UL1RR024989, and NIH Grant T32 DK007319. Nestlé Product Technology Center, Solon and Cereal Partners Worldwide provided the study meals and foods.\n\nAbout Cleveland Clinic\n\nCleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education. Located in Cleveland, Ohio, it was founded in 1921 by four renowned physicians with a vision of providing outstanding patient care based upon the principles of cooperation, compassion and innovation. Cleveland Clinic has pioneered many medical breakthroughs, including coronary artery bypass surgery and the first face transplant in the United States. U.S.News & World Report consistently names Cleveland Clinic as one of the nation\'s best hospitals in its annual ""America\'s Best Hospitals"" survey. Among Cleveland Clinic\'s 49,000 employees are more than 3,400 full-time salaried physicians and researchers and 14,000 nurses, representing 120 medical specialties and subspecialties. The Cleveland Clinic health system includes a 165-acre main campus near downtown Cleveland, nine community hospitals, more than 150 northern Ohio outpatient locations - including 18 full-service family health centers and three health and wellness centers -- and locations in Weston, Fla.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Toronto, Canada; Abu Dhabi, UAE; and London, England. In 2015, there were 6.6 million outpatient visits, 164,700 hospital admissions and 208,807 surgical cases throughout the Cleveland Clinic health system. Patients came for treatment from every state and 180 countries. Visit us at http://www. clevelandclinic. org .

Each diet contained the same nutritional values but the whole grain diet consumers experienced a lowering of their diastolic blood pressure, which the researchers say lowers their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. But lowered blood pressure was a surrogate outcome, not a reduction in risk as the release claimed. It would take a larger outcomes study to determine if the diet reduced cardiovascular risk.
The release also points to reductions in relative risks rather than absolute risks, fails to mention costs or any potential harms from such diets, and neglects to state that three of the 11 authors work for the funding company, which also makes whole-grain foods.

Narod, M.D., of Women\'s College Research Institute, in Ontario, Canada, and co-authors\n\nResults: A small improvement in breast cancer survival was associated with radiation plus lumpectomy for DCIS. The absolute risk reduction was 0.27 percent, making it necessary to treat 370 women to save one life. Patients who had lumpectomy plus radiation had more local recurrences than the mastectomy patients but had fewer deaths.\n\nStudy Limitations: Some data were missing; investigators didn\'t have information on tamoxifen use; treatments in the study population weren\'t randomly assigned; and the possibility remains that the decision to undergo radiotherapy was associated with other favorable prognostic factors.\n\nRelated Material: The invited commentary, ""Systemic Effects of Radiotherapy in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ,"" by Mira Goldberg, M.D., and Timothy J.

The study utilized the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database to evaluate outcomes. DCIS is a noninvasive form of breast cancer, sometimes referred to as stage 0 breast cancer. There is debate as to whether it should be called cancer at all. The study reported outcomes in three groups of patients:  1) patients who underwent lumpectomy (surgery to remove the tumor) plus radiation versus lumpectomy alone; 2) patients who underwent lumpectomy without radiation versus mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast); and 3) patients who underwent lumpectomy plus radiation versus mastectomy.  Women who received radiation had a slightly lower (0.27% reduction) risk of death from breast cancer at 15 years compared to women with lumpectomy alone.
The release mentions some limitations of the research but missing is a broader discussion of the potential for over treatment of DCIS, whether DCIS needs to be treated at all, and whether women with low-risk forms of the disease can be safely monitored without treatment. We’ve written about this previously.

Twells, a clinical epidemiologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland. She bases this bold claim on her experience with seriously obese patients and a detailed analysis of the best studies yet done showing weight-loss surgery’s ability to reverse the often devastating effects of being extremely overweight on health and quality of life.\n\n“I haven’t come across a patient yet who wouldn’t recommend it,” Dr. Twells said in an interview. “Most say they wish they’d done it 10 years sooner.” She explained that the overwhelming majority of patients who undergo bariatric surgery have spent many years trying — and failing — to lose weight and keep it off. And the reason is not a lack of willpower.\n\n“These patients have lost hundreds of pounds over and over again,” Dr. Twells said. “The weight that it takes them one year to lose is typically back in two months,” often because a body with longstanding obesity defends itself against weight loss by drastically reducing its metabolic rate, an effect not seen after bariatric surgery, which permanently changes the contours of the digestive tract.\n\nIn reviewing studies that followed patients for five to 25 years after weight-loss surgery, Dr. Twells and colleagues found major long-lasting benefits to the patients’ health and quality of life. Matched with comparable patients who did not have surgery, those who did fared much better physically, emotionally and socially. They rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report problems with mobility, pain, daily activities, social interactions and feelings of depression and anxiety, among other factors that can compromise well-being.']","Benefits are discussed at length, but only in vague terms.","The story offers an overview of benefits associated with permanent bariatric surgery. It cites several studies, and includes links to all of them, and includes important information about the cost of surgery.
However, the benefits — and health risks — of such surgeries are discussed in only general terms, and the story borders on advertorial copy when it opens with this unsubstantiated quote: “Bariatric surgery is probably the most effective intervention we have in health care.”

It’s defined by what the patient tells you,” he added. “It’s hard for some patients’ families and their doctors to get their head around what it is and whether it’s real. So, that these results were so positive for something that’s very safe is an impressive accomplishment.”\n\nRecent studies have suggested that tai chi, with its slow exercises, breathing and meditation, could benefit patients with other chronic conditions, including arthritis. But not all of these reports have been conclusive, and tai chi is hard to study because there are many styles and approaches.\n\nThe fibromyalgia study involved the yang style of tai chi, taught by a Boston tai chi master, Ramel Rones. Dr. Solomon and other experts cautioned that bigger studies with other masters and approaches were necessary.\n\nStill, patients, who received twice-weekly tai chi classes and a DVD to practice with 20 minutes daily, showed weekly improvement on an established measurement, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, improving more than the stretching-and-education group in physicians’ assessments, sleep, walking and mental health.

And Dr. Gloria Yeh, a Beth Israel Deaconess internist and co-author of the editorial, said others “will say, ‘It’s too slow, I can’t do that.’ ”\n\nBut she said it offered a “gentler option” for patients deterred by other physical activities. “The mind-body connections set it apart from other exercises,” she said, adding that doctors are seeking “anything we can offer that will make patients say ‘I can really do this.’ ”""]",The best of the five stories we reviewed on the same study.  Read why. ," This is a well considered look at a limited study of an unusual approach to a disorder that has stumped clinicians for decades.

He\'s a professor of anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\nThe dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells, on both sides of each of the spine\'s vertebra, and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body, spinal cord and brain. Stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain, the researchers explained.\n\nA pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness. The strength of stimulation, programmed by a doctor, is based on the patient\'s level of pain, he said.\n\nThe treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. In spinal cord stimulation, a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine, but the pulses don\'t target the specific pain source.\n\nIn addition, dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. McCarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in 67 people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to 18 months. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year.\n\nBefore receiving the device, most patients rated their pain as an 8 on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst. For most patients, the device reduced pain by 33 percent, which was significant, the researchers reported.\n\nIn addition, patients said they experienced a 27 percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain. In all, 94 percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial.\n\nThe procedure was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.\n\nMcCarthy said the therapy is not widely available, even though it was approved by the FDA in 2016. At the moment, its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.\n\nAlso, the procedure isn\'t covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.\n\nFor uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.\n\nSpine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies may have varying policies.\n\nMcCarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available, especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain.\n\nOne pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure.\n\n""The results of this study are very significant,"" said Dr. Kiran Patel, director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nIt shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.\n\n""In my pain practice and career, dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain,"" Patel said.\n\n""I encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate,"" she said.\n\nThe findings were presented Sunday at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, in San Francisco. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke for more on back pain.']",But the story did a good job of reporting on the cost and availability of this procedure.,"This story reports on an study of 67 people with chronic back pain, most of whom reported feeling at least a little better after they had a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulator implanted in their spine.

The story did a good job of reporting on the cost and availability of this procedure. However, it didn’t acknowledge that the study’s findings are unreliable because there was no comparison with a control arm of patients who didn’t get the device.

The authors presented their findings February 2 at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2018 in San Diego.\n\nThe findings could influence how neurologists prescribe the medication. ""Neurologists have been looking for safer ways to administer natalizumab infusions to their patients, but there hasn\'t been clear data on whether decreasing dosing frequency improves safety,"" says first study author Lana Zhovtis Ryerson, MD, assistant professor of neurology at NYU School of Medicine and an attending neurologist at NYU Langone\'s Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center. ""Our safety findings are clinically and statistically significant, and we believe that extending the dosing schedule of natalizumab is practice changing and may save lives.""\n\nNatalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to prevent MS relapses, improve quality of life, and slow worsening disability. The medication is indicated to be prescribed in 300-milligram infusion doses every 4 weeks.\n\nTaking the medication longer than two years, however, may increase risk PML, which is caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). There have been 756 PML cases reported worldwide as of January 2018, with a global incidence rate of 4.19 per 1,000 PML cases in people treated with natalizumab. Patients who test JCV antibody-positive are typically either told to not to start natalizumab, or have had treatment stopped after two years, when risk was deemed to be too high.\n\nThe new study, however, reports safety data through up to 72 months, or 6 years, when the extended dosing regimens were applied, with risk reduction for PML as high as 94 percent.\n\nHow the Study Was Conducted\n\nResearchers reviewed data on all patients who have been exposed to JCV who are enrolled in TOUCH, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for natalizumab that requires manufacturers to document all uses of a medication to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Since the optimal extended dose schedule is not known, researchers chose to look at the data in multiple ways, with the primary definition looking at extended dose history in the last 18 months, the secondary definition looking at extended dose occurring at any time in the dosing history, and for tertiary definition looking primarily at how extended dose history affects PML risk. The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions.\n\nThe new study did not look at drug efficacy comparing extended to standard doses. However, previous research led by Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson\'s group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication\'s efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people. The authors are planning prospective efficacy studies of extended dose natalizumab.\n\nNatalizumab is manufactured by Biogen Idec and Elan, and sold under the name Tysabri®. Biogen provided the researchers access to their data and statistical support.\n\nOther infusion disease-modifying therapies approved to treat MS include the drugs alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab. Oral and injectable medications are also prescribed.\n\n###\n\nThe study was carried out in collaboration with Biogen and academic collaborators from NYU School of Medicine\'s Division of Biostatics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, and Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Clinic in Utah.\n\nIn addition to Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson, Ilya Kister, MD, associate professor of neurology, Judith D. Goldberg, professor of population health and environmental medicine, and Xiaochun Li, PhD, research scientist of biostatistics, were co-authors at NYU Langone Health. Other co-authors include Dr. John Foley, Dr. Ih Chang, Professor Gary R. Cutter, Dr. Ryan Metzger, Dr. Evan Riddle, Dr. Bei Yu, Dr. Zheng Ren, Dr. Christophe Hotermans, Dr. Pei-Ran Ho, and Dr. Nolan Campbell.']",The news releases also left out mention of several major conflicts of interest.,"Researchers referenced in this news release presented study findings last week at a national multiple sclerosis (MS) meeting suggesting that giving the drug natalizumab less frequently may dramatically reduce the risk for developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection.

One group of 105 patients was offered a three-month regimen of self-care advice on diet, exercise and psychological support.\n\nThe second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of ""traditional"" acupuncture.\n\nAll of the participants kept hot flash diaries. At the end of the three-month period (and for up to six months thereafter) daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency.\n\nThe result: by the end of the treatment period, those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were 50 percent lower than those in the non-acupuncture group. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended.\n\nThose in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health, with no serious side effects, the study authors said.\n\nSo why does acupuncture seem to work?\n\nRazzini cited several reasons, including acupuncture\'s ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient\'s nervous system, while stimulating the release of endorphins -- a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion. It also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine, as well as the mood regulator serotonin.\n\nRazzini didn\'t know how much American patients might have to pay for such treatment, but added, ""Compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants, (acupuncture) should be less expensive, and, for sure, more safe and feasible.""\n\nDr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look.\n\n""Anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice, because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti-hormonal treatment can be profound,"" she said.\n\n""Almost all women experience them. For some it\'s a moderate situation, but for others it\'s a really significant problem. Some women -- I would say probably about 15 percent -- have such severe hot flashes that they even refuse to take medications that can cut their risk for cancer or cancer recurrence by 50 percent, simply because they can\'t handle the hot flashes,"" Vito explained.\n\n""And I\'ve actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I\'m not surprised by the finding,"" she added. ""But it is heartening that we now have scientific proof that this can work. Which, in the end, may help to encourage insurance companies to their expand coverage so this can become an affordable option for all patients in need.""\n\nMore information\n\nThere\'s more on cancer and hot flashes at the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']","When previous research exists, it’s important to place the new work in context. How is the new work different? This HealthDay story about a study looking at treating hot flashes with acupuncture for breast cancer patients didn’t fill in readers on older research.","The story focuses on a recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology that finds female breast cancer patients who use acupuncture therapy in conjunction with “enhanced self-care” had fewer problems with hot flashes than patients who used only enhanced self-care.
The story does a good job of explaining the study’s design, and includes an independent source. However, it fell short when quantifying the benefits, and it did not discuss potential harms or the already existing body of work related to acupuncture’s use to ameliorate hot flashes in breast cancer patients.

And the news is very good.\n\nThe paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective, they found that it offered a lasting benefit, reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12-month study period.\n\n“This study represents a major advance for neurosurgery, treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of ET,” Elias said. “For the first time in a randomized controlled trial, we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease.”\n\nPioneering Tremor TrialThe multi-site clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor, a condition that often robs people of their ability to write, feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The mean age was 71, and most had suffered with their tremor for many years.\n\nSeventy-five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging. The remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure, to act as the control group. (They would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure.)\n\nParticipants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement, with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period. The researchers employed a 32-point scale to assess tremor severity, and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months. Participants reported major improvements in their quality of life. People who couldn’t feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so.\n\nParticipants who received the sham procedure, on the other hand, showed no significant improvements.\n\n“The degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study, but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life – that’s what patients really care about,” Elias said.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face; in most instances, these side effects were temporary but some were permanent.\n\nFDA Approved Based on the clinical trial led by Elias, the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the focused ultrasound device, manufactured by InSightec Inc., for the treatment of essential tremor. The device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. That heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor. Elias can actually watch as patients’ tremor decreases, and the real-time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain.\n\nThe FDA approval means UVA can make the procedure available to eligible patients. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it’s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients. Because the approach is so new, insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure, though that may change in the coming months. The cost at UVA has not yet been determined.\n\nPeople interested in the procedure can learn more at uvahealth.com/focusedultrasound. The site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as UVA prepares to make the treatment available.\n\nThe procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. It can’t be used in patients who cannot undergo MRI imaging, including those with implanted metallic devices such as a pacemaker. It is also not available for pregnant women, people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure, patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders, patients on blood thinners, patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues. There are other exclusions as well. Doctors at UVA will evaluate potential patients to determine their eligibility and then recommend the best course of treatment.\n\nGroundbreaking ResearchUVA is a world leader in focused ultrasound research. Elias and his colleagues are testing the capability of focused ultrasound to treat Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, brain tumors and benign breast tumors.\n\nThe essential tremor research has been supported by InSightec, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the BIRD (US-Israel Binational Industry Research and Development) Foundation.\n\nFOR REPORTERS: Elias will be available for interviews today, and he’ll be doing a Facebook Live broadcast at 3:15 Eastern. To arrange an interview, contact Alex Prevost at 434.906.7255 or amp3gb@virginia.edu. High-resolution images and video are available as well.\n\n####']",More than a third of the patients in the study developed gait problems or numbness. These side effects of the surgery were downplayed in the release.,"This release reports the results of a randomized, multicenter, sham-controlled clinical trial testing the safety and efficacy of a new approach to controlling essential tremors in the elderly — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound — to alter the thalamus in the brain and thus control tremors. The approach would be an alternative to the current procedure — deep-brain stimulation — which is more invasive.
The study showed substantial improvement in a reduction of tremors for many patients at three-, six- and 12-months.  But it also showed that about a third of the patients in the study experienced not insignificant adverse effects from the procedure. The release presents a glowing picture of the promise of this new approach while disregarding the caveats offered both in the journal paper and an accompanying editorial about the study.
To see how a news outlet covered this new research, see our review of a STAT article.  Like the news release, the STAT story didn’t provide us enough quantification of the benefits or mention a potentional conflict of interest between researchers and device manufacturers. But the STAT article picked up on some things the release missed, including more discussion of the harms observed in the study.

Ketamine infusion therapy, the controversial treatment for depression, has been resisted by many physicians due to concerns about short-lived benefits, risks of addiction, and the lack of large scale studies. In contrast, this retrospective study of over three years of clinical experience, shows lasting benefits for many patients, with no apparent risk of addiction. Through a handful of ketamine infusions directed by Theodore Henderson, MD, PhD, refractory depression symptoms can be relieved significantly and persistently. Evidence points to the regeneration of brain cells as a critical mechanism for the relief of depression, as published in peer-reviewed journal Neural Regeneration Research, February 2016 issue.\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160316/345149\n\nThe study, ""Practical application of the neuroregenerative properties of ketamine: real world treatment experience,"" addresses key points in the controversy surrounding the use of intravenous ketamine for the treatment of depression. Its findings stand in direct contrast to warnings from the American Psychiatric Association (APA).\n\nWhile controversial in academic settings, Dr. Henderson said his direct experience supports a different strategy for multiple-infusion treatment regimens and his clinical experience shows ketamine can invoke long-lasting effects often with less than six infusions.\n\n""The wealth of clinical experience from treating hundreds of patients with ketamine has supplanted the preliminary data that emerged from the initial open-label and small double-blinded studies,"" said Dr. Henderson, who is a board certified psychiatrist, specializing in diagnosing and treating complex conditions, based in Denver, Colorado. He is also the co-founder of Neuro-Luminance Ketamine Infusion Centers.\n\nPatients in the study completed the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR), among other scales, and 80% showed persistent positive response to the ketamine infusions treatments.\n\nWhat is a Ketamine Infusion?\n\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic in use since 1970\'s. Intravenous administration over a prolonged period of time is key to its persistent antidepressant benefit.\n\nDepression is associated with neuron loss, reduced synapse numbers, and dearborization of dendrites. Ketamine appears to potently induce mechanisms which reverse these neuro-degenerative processes. Citing over 60 published scientific research studies, the new research article also reviews the molecular mechanisms by which ketamine invokes a robust activation of the brain\'s own repair mechanisms. Another conclusion Dr. Henderson highlights is ketamine infusions can relieve refractory depression symptoms persistently, perhaps for years.\n\n""Activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) appears to have an important role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. BDNF induces synaptogenesis, dendritic arborization, improved neuronal health, and neurogenesis. These processes likely underlie the persistent benefits of ketamine.""\n\nDr. Henderson\'s findings challenge the oft-held beliefs that ketamine must be given frequently to have any benefit and that ketamine has no long-lasting benefit.\n\nDr. Henderson stated, ""Misconceptions about ketamine abound among psychiatrists, particularly related to possible chemical dependence problems. However, the neurobiological basis of its benefit for depression has nothing to do with causing addictive risk. Our patients get better after a few infusions and from there treatments can be discontinued."" The study also challenges concerns about neurotoxicity and a recent hypothesis that patients must experience hallucinations during ketamine infusion in order to have an anti-depressant benefit.\n\nPlease visit Neuro-Luminance or call (855) 978-0808 for more information.\n\nMedia Contact: David Jahr, (949) 874-2667\n\nSOURCE Neuro-Luminance']",This news release relies primarily on anecdotal data while promoting privately held treatment centers.,"This news release cites findings from a physician’s “real world experience” in using the anesthesia drug ketamine for the treatment of depression, and promotes the Neuro-Luminence Ketamine Infusion Centers, which the study author  Dr. Theodore Henderson, co-founded. Acknowledged in the release as “controversial” and in direct opposition to the recommendations of the American Psychiatric Association, the use of ketamine can improve depression symptoms with six infusions or less, according to the release. The news release is thin on the kinds of facts we look for to support assertions about a drug’s safety and efficacy. It doesn’t address cost, benefit data or harms. It touts the putative benefits of a treatment that has not been approved by federal health authorities as either safe or effective, and it offers little evidence to support its use. It makes no mention of randomized trials in terms of real data–the only way one can tell if a treatment is really of benefit.

REUTERS/Michaela Rehle\n\nPeople who have coronary artery disease ruled out by the scan benefit, and so do those with severe blockages diagnosed, while those who have moderate artery disease confirmed may only become more anxious after the scan, researchers found.\n\nComputed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), is a high-resolution X-ray of the heart that can be used to diagnose the reason for angina, or chest pain, symptoms and clarify what other treatments might be needed.\n\n“Patients with normal coronary arteries or those with severe coronary artery disease seemed to get the most benefit in quality of life and did best,” senior study author Dr. David E. Newby from University/BHF Center for Cardiovascular Science in Edinburgh, told Reuters Health.\n\n“This suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and CTCA really helps provide this reassurance. Conversely, knowing the cause of your symptoms is due to coronary heart disease and patients undergo treatment for it, is also very helpful,” he said by email.\n\nAlthough getting CTCA is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on, its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary, the researchers note in the journal Heart.\n\nNewby and his team assessed how CTCA affected symptoms and quality of life six weeks and six months after the scan for 4,146 patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease.\n\nWhen the CTCA results revealed something less than a blockage, so-called nonobstructive disease, as the cause for the patient’s chest pain, patients’ quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months.\n\nThis reflects the fact that the cause of the symptoms had been unknown before and in addition they now have heart artery disease that needs treatment, Newby said.\n\nThe findings were similar when it came to changes in symptoms during follow-up. Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.\n\n“Although CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,” Newby said. “Much like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,” he added.\n\nIf a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.\n\n“If, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,” Newby said. “Certainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.”\n\n“It was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,” said Dr. Paula M. C. Mommersteeg from the Center of Research on Psychology in Somatic Diseases, Tilburg University, The Netherlands, who has investigated associations between personality traits and coronary artery disease symptoms.\n\n“In my opinion, CTCA does have added value in the diagnostic process (improved decision making), it is less invasive than coronary angiography (CAG), and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients,” Mommersteeg concluded.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2lEdxAV Heart, online February 28, 2017.']",Other approaches to addressing uncertainties about a patient’s heart condition — including stress tests — would have been useful to include.,"This story explores the influence of computed tomography (CT) scans of blood flow in the heart on symptoms and quality of life of chest pain patients. The story makes clear that the benefits vary, with the most benefit going to those patients who are either told they can stop medical treatment or that there is effective treatment for them. Patients who discovered their disease was worse than they had believed fared worse after they received the scans.
Readers get a sense that the decision to add computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) — a high-resolution X-ray of the heart — to their diagnostic process should be approached individually. The value of this nuanced description of the study results is undercut, however, by a lack of context. Readers are not given any background about other approaches to managing anxiety and uncertainty in patients with chest pain. The story fails to note costs of the test and the study limitations that researchers listed in their journal article. The article also omitted one of the downsides of screening tests: the potential for over-diagnosis leading to unnecessary, stress-producing follow-up tests.

Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study.\n\n“Women with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures should not stop taking their treatment,” she told Reuters Health.\n\nBone drugs include Merck’s Fosamax, Roche’s Boniva, Novartis’s Reclast, and Warner Chilcott’s Actonel.\n\nSome 10 million Americans currently suffer from bone thinning, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The majority are postmenopausal women.\n\nPark-Wyllie and colleagues tapped into data on more than 205,000 Ontario women at least 68 years old who had taken the bone drugs. Their findings appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOverall, 716 women suffered the unusual type of thighbone fracture after starting the bone drugs, and nearly 10,000 had typical hip fractures.\n\nThe risk of a thighbone fracture differed depending on how long the women had been taking the medicine. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year.\n\nThat works out to nearly three times the risk of those who’d taken the drugs for roughly three months or less, after accounting for other risk factors.\n\nOn the other hand, longer treatment was tied to a 24-percent decrease in hip fractures, which along with wrist and spine fractures affect about half of all people with osteoporosis.\n\nThere are several alternative ways to treat osteoporosis, including hormone treatment for women. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health.\n\nSo far, however, the cheap and effective bisphosphonate bone drugs remain the most popular treatment option. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.\n\n“The bad news is that overstating the levels of risk of side effects with these drugs — which the media have been doing for some time now — has led people to stop the drugs when they should be taking them,” said Dr. Ethel S. Siris, who heads the Toni Stabile Osteoporosis Center at Columbia University in New York.\n\nApart from atypical fractures, the most serious side effect of the bone drugs is bone death, or osteonecrosis, of the jaw. But that’s a very rare problem, experts say, which only affects about one in 100,000 people on bisphosphonates.\n\n“If you’re taking the drugs and you’ve been on them for a while, but aren’t sure if you’re at high risk, you should ask your doctor about it,” Park-Wyllie advised.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal expert panel, recommends screening all women over 65 for osteoporosis.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/4HWZ7 JAMA/Journal of the American Medical Association, online February 22, 2011.']",Good job of reporting on a new study’s conclusion on the tradeoffs involved in the use of bisphosphonate drugs for osteporosis.,"Strong points:

Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet.\n\nLomaira is the only strength of phentermine hydrochloride that can be taken up to three times a day before meals. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use.\n\n""At KVK Tech, we are committed to developing high-quality, FDA-approved medicines that address unmet medical needs, while ensuring affordable options for all appropriate patients. With Lomaira, we\'re giving physicians and patients access to a low-cost, low-dose version of a weight-reduction medicine, phentermine, that has been prescribed by physicians for over 50 years. Appropriate patients can take Lomaira up to three times a day, before meals – not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine,"" said Anthony Tabasso, President and Chief Executive Officer of KVK Tech. ""We developed Lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind.""\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride, an appetite suppressant, is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss. Over 7 million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals (HCPs), including obesity medicine specialists, family practitioners, endocrinologists, internists and cardiologists. 1\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast. The usual adult dose of Lomaira is one tablet three times a day 1/2 hour before meals. The butterfly-shaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose, enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weight-loss treatment plan to best meet each patient\'s needs. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.\n\nLomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle, despite the fact that two-thirds of Americans pay out-of-pocket for their weight-loss prescription medications. Through KVK Tech\'s Lomaira Lo-Cost Access Program , eligible patients will pay no more than 50¢ per tablet for the duration of treatment.\n\n""Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions. Many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weight-management plan. Now, the flexibility in dosing with Lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing. They can prescribe a lower dose, a good option for some patients. They can also prescribe up to three times a day, which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon,"" said Donna Ryan, MD. ""Regrettably, many patients are still not covered by insurance for weight-loss medications and the low cost for Lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option.""\n\nIn relatively short-term clinical trials, adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with ""anorectic"" drugs (appetite suppressants) lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 2\n\n""Even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health,"" continued Dr. Ryan. ""It is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit.""

Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), a rare fatal lung disease, has been reported in patients who had taken a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible association between phentermine use alone and PPH cannot be ruled out. Patients should report immediately if they experience any decrease in the amount of exercise that they can normally tolerate, shortness of breath, chest or heart pain, fainting or swelling in the lower legs.\n\nSerious heart valve problems or disease have been reported in patients taking a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine has not been established, therefore the possibility of an association between heart valve disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf your body becomes adjusted to the maximum dose of phentermine so that its effects are experienced less strongly, the maximum dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect.\n\nCaution is advised while engaging in potentially hazardous activity such as driving or operating machinery while taking phentermine. Phentermine has the potential to be abused. Keep Lomaira in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Using alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction.\n\nPhentermine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure, even if it\'s mild. If you are taking medicines for type 2 diabetes, your doctor may have to adjust these medicines while taking phentermine.\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine.

While it gets points for addressing the issue of costs and it is exuberant in its information on possible side effects and other medical concerns, the release doesn’t offer any quantification of benefits or evidence needed to assess the usefulness of the drug compared with other weight-control measures.
As a generic version of an already approved drug, the manufacturer of Lomaira needed to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence with phentermine, meaning it needs to contain the same active ingredient and be just as safe as the originator drug. A discussion of the quantified benefits of other formulations of phentermine and a comparison with other methods of weight loss would have been helpful to readers.

The study, released on July 26, 2016, shows that patients with the most common form of brain tumor can be treated in an effective and substantially less toxic way by omitting a widely used portion of radiation therapy. These results will allow tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors to experience a better quality of life while maintaining the same length of life.\n\nAnthony L. Asher, MD, FACS, medical director at Carolinas HealthCare System\'s Neurosciences Institute and the senior author on the report, and as well as Stuart H. Burri, MD, chairman, department of radiation oncology at Levine Cancer Institute, began their research on this subject over 10 years ago in Charlotte, North Carolina. Along with Dr. Paul Brown at Mayo Clinic, they spearheaded an international, multi-institutional, randomized trial that will ultimately improve the standard of care for patients with a specific type of brain tumor, brain metastases, by reducing the toxicity of their treatment without reducing the effectiveness.\n\nTypical therapies for these types of brain tumors include surgery, whole brain radiation therapy and focused radiation, also known as stereotactic radiosurgery. ""We discovered that whole brain radiation added to focused radiation in the treatment of brain metastases – in other words, cancer that travels to the brain- reduces the number of new brain tumors over time; however, patients receiving the whole brain radiation had significantly more difficulties with memory and complex thinking than patients who only had the focused radiation,"" says Dr. Asher.\n\n""Whole brain radiation patients also reported worse quality of life compared with patients who only received the focused radiation,"" adds Dr. Burri. ""Interestingly, the data showed that the addition of whole brain radiation produced no improvement in survival.""\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, in 2016, there will be approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States. Almost one in four of those patients (about 400,000) will experience spread of their cancers to the brain. In contrast, 300,000 and 240,000 patients will be newly diagnosed with breast and primary lung cancers, respectively, each year. ""Brain metastases are not only extremely common, they are also a major source of disability in society,"" says Dr. Asher. Because of their location, these tumors often produce severe neurological symptoms, such as headaches, weakness or problems with speech and information processing, thereby compromising both daily function and quality of life in cancer patients.\n\nAccording to Dr. Asher, there are two primary objectives in cancer care:\n\nTo improve survivalTo maintain or improve quality of life for patients""The first and highest rule of medical care is \'do no harm,\'"" says Dr. Asher. ""Consistent with that obligation, when it isn\'t possible to extend survival with various therapies, it\'s absolutely essential that we work to reduce or eliminate any possibility that quality of life will be compromised by treatments. Another way to state that principle for cancer care, is that when two cancer therapies produce similar survival, it\'s important to understand which therapy offers patients a better quality of life.""\n\nIn this study, although whole brain radiation decreased the number of new brain tumors over time, its addition to focused radiation interestingly did not result in a survival benefit over focused radiation alone. Furthermore, whole brain therapy was associated with considerably worse quality of life.\n\n""In the past, clinicians who treated patients with brain tumors seldom used sophisticated techniques like neurocognitive tests to evaluate patients\' daily function in response to various therapies,"" said Dr. Burri. ""Without those tests, we might have incorrectly concluded that whole brain radiation was a better option for patients because it made their scans look better, at least in the short term. However, the data from our study shows that clinicians can no longer simply rely on the results of traditional lab tests or scans to assess the value of care; we have to understand the total impact of cancer therapies on our patients.""\n\nDrs. Asher and Burri emphasize that the real importance of this study is its potential to make us think differently about what really matters in cancer therapy.\n\nThe trial authors concluded that the benefit of adding whole brain radiation was outweighed by its risks in patients with one to three newly diagnosed brain metastases. This is a very relevant finding, as over 200,000 patients still receive whole brain radiation in the United States each year, and the majority of patients with brain metastases have a limited number (typically three or less) of brain lesions. Drs. Asher and Burri, along with their co-investigators, now recommend that patients with one to three brain metastases should no longer receive routine whole brain radiation therapy, and should be treated with focused therapy alone to better preserve cognitive function and quality of life.\n\n""Having the research published in JAMA is validation of more than a decade of work,"" says Dr. Burri. "" It is deeply satisfying to have developed an important scientific project, work in close collaboration with other investigators to obtain support from the National Cancer Institute, then carry the to carry the trial to completion with publication of impactful results in one of the leading medical journals in the world.""\n\nDrs. Asher and Burri are now working on a new method of focused therapy for tumors that have spread to the brain that combines radiation and surgery. The technique was pioneered at Levine Cancer Institute and they are looking to expand and further validate the approach with the National Cancer Institute.\n\nAbout Carolinas HealthCare System Carolinas HealthCare System (carolinashealthcare.org), one of the nation\'s leading and most innovative healthcare organizations, provides a full spectrum of healthcare and wellness programs throughout North and South Carolina.

The release doesn’t explain.,"A comparison of radiation treatments for some patients with metastatic brain tumors produced useful evidence that adding whole brain radiation to radiation focused on just the tumors was associated with more cognitive declines and lower quality of life, without adding to survival. That’s a noteworthy finding, but the news release obscures the advance in clinical evidence behind a flurry of superlatives, while leaving out important context. One bright spot is that the release highlights the finding that the patients given both whole brain and focused radiation had cleaner brain scans, but then did not live any longer. That’s an important reminder that disease progression tests do not necessarily point to better outcomes.
The study results, as the release notes, could help spare many patients from over-treatment. But rather than promising a “better quality of life,” the release would have done better to stick to a more sober portrayal, that the study supports recommendations updated in recent years against using whole brain radiation in these patients.

That could drive down a person’s risk of fatal heart attack or stroke by 10%, the authors suggested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this doesn’t mean that people on statins should go dump their drugs for tofu, said Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Dr. Steve Nissen, who was not involved in the study. Dietary changes do not have nearly the research track record that statins have racked up for heart attack prevention, he said.\n\n“Patients don’t want to take the medications, and I’m afraid that if you tell them there’s a diet that works just as well, then they’ll do that instead,” he said.\n\nNearly 1 in 6 Americans has a high overall cholesterol level, which makes a person nearly twice as likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke as someone whose total cholesterol falls into a healthy range. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is one component of this overall number.\n\nLast year, statin and other lipid-regulating drugs were the nation’s most commonly prescribed medications, with more than 355 million prescriptions dispensed, according to the healthcare information firm IMS Health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multi-center Canadian study tested a diet that contained a portfolio of cholesterol-fighting foods such as soy protein, nuts, “sticky” fiber such as that found in oats and barley, and plant sterols. Subjects were instructed to eat a handful of nuts such as almonds or walnuts every day, and to substitute milk and meats with soy and tofu products as much as possible.\n\nOne of the most potent cholesterol-busters in that mix, plant sterols (sometimes called stanols), occurs in small amounts in many grains, nuts, vegetables, legumes and fruits and also can be added to foods or taken as a dietary supplement. Plant sterols mimic LDL cholesterol particles in the gut, preventing the absorption of those particles so that they pass through the body and are disposed of as waste.\n\nThe 345 subjects in the study, which was coordinated by a team based at St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, all suffered high cholesterol levels and were considered at elevated risk of coronary heart disease. The subjects each followed one of three diets: an “intensive portfolio” diet, a “routine portfolio” diet, or a high-fiber, low-saturated-fat diet rich in produce and whole grains, which is commonly recommended to those who have had had a heart attack or need to lower their cholesterol.\n\nAmong the 267 subjects who completed the trial, all three groups lost roughly an equal amount of weight — between about 2 pounds 10 ounces and 3 pounds 12 ounces — after six months. But those on one of the portfolio diets — intensive or routine — saw their LDL cholesterol levels decline between 13.1% and 13.8% after six months.\n\nSubjects on the low-saturated-fat diet had, on average, a 3% reduction in their LDL cholesterol in the same period.\n\nDr. Walter Willett, a nutrition and health expert at Harvard University’s School of Public Health who was not involved in the study, said that the trial was “nicely done” and that it underscored the fact that “just focusing on reducing saturated and total fat is not the most effective diet for reducing heart disease risk factors or heart disease itself.”\n\nThe authors acknowledged that the components in the portfolio diet were well-known for their cholesterol-busting properties. But their research is the first to test the relative effects of those dietary interventions in a real-world comparison, and to gauge how readily people can understand and implement such a diet in everyday life.\n\nIt was pretty easily done, the scientists found. Subjects in the intensive group got as many as seven sessions of instruction and guidance, while those in the routine group got one 60-minute session plus a 40-minute refresher — but both groups realized roughly equal benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers also found that the greater a subject’s adherence to the portfolio diet, the more dramatic, on average, was the LDL cholesterol reduction.\n\nBut Cleveland Clinic’s Nissen stressed that researchers did not directly measure rates of coronary heart disease — just LDL cholesterol — so the health effects of the portfolio diet are not yet clear.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">There were some strong points to this story.  Unfortunately, they were matched by some pretty important weaknesses.  Read on for details.</span>","This story was about a study comparing a special vegetarian diet containing a “portfolio” of cholesterol-lowering foods (e.g. nuts, soy, margarines fortified with plant sterols) with standard dietary advice for preventing heart disease (e.g. cut out saturated fat). There was plenty to like about this story, including comments from two excellent independent sources which added valuable context to the piece. The story also makes the very important point that this study looked only at a surrogate marker of heart disease risk, LDL cholesterol, and not actual heart disease outcomes. But the story didn’t provide crucial information about costs or availability of the diet components and it didn’t fairly describe how difficult it would be for most people to maintain this kind of diet. These mistakes are compounded by a glaring misinterpretation of the study which is trumpeted in the headline — i.e. that the diet tested in the study lowered LDL cholesterol “more than statin drugs.”

The first two drugs raise dopamine levels in the body, and the last two drugs reduce the amount of calcium reaching brain cells and trigger the production of other chemicals that help reduce pain. Dopamine is a brain chemical that regulates movement and mood.\n\n""Physicians and patients now have better information on the effectiveness and harms of two types of drug treatments for patients with at least moderately severe restless legs symptoms in which to guide treatment choices,"" said review author Dr. Timothy Wilt, core investigator at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.\n\nRestless legs syndrome causes a person to feel a powerful urge to move his or her legs. The legs become uncomfortable when lying down or sitting, and the condition can disrupt sleep and take a toll on the quality of life, the researchers said.\n\nOne expert, Dr. Martin Niethammer, a neurologist at the Movement Disorders Center of North Shore-LIJ\'s Cushing Neuroscience Institute in Manhasset, N.Y., said this study is merely a review of the current treatments for restless legs syndrome.\n\n""There is nothing new here at all,"" he said. ""It doesn\'t add anything to the field.""\n\nThis is just a compilation of evidence that follows guidelines that have been long established in both Europe and the United States, Niethammer said.\n\n""These are the only treatments approved by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],"" he added.\n\nThe report was published in the March 4 online issue of JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nFor the analysis, Wilt\'s team reviewed 29 clinical trials. The researchers found that 61 percent of those taking dopamine agonists showed at least a 50 percent improvement in their symptoms, compared with 41 percent of those taking an inactive placebo.\n\nIn addition, those taking dopamine agonists slept better and scored higher on measures of quality of life. Dopamine agonists were originally developed to treat Parkinson\'s disease.\n\nSide effects of dopamine agonists can include euphoria, hallucinations, weight loss, nausea, insomnia, tiredness or weakness, dizziness and drowsiness.\n\nThere are generic versions of Requip that cost far less, running between $11 and $22 a month. Insurance covers the treatment in most cases, so actual out-of-pocket costs will vary by insurance plan. The same is true for levodopa, Wilt said.\n\nNeurontin and Lyrica also helped relieve symptoms in 61 percent of patients, compared with 37 percent of those taking a placebo, the researchers found.\n\nThe most common side effects of these drugs include fatigue, swelling in the legs, dizziness and weight gain.\n\nWithout insurance, Lyrica costs can run more than $100 a month, but again co-pays will vary by plan, Wilt said. The same is true for Neurontin, which can cost $117 to $135 a month without insurance.\n\nWilt noted there is no information on the effectiveness of treatments in pregnant women, young or old patients, those with milder symptoms or those with other serious medical conditions. ""We urge caution in extending our conclusions to these individuals,"" he noted.\n\n""Treatments for restless legs syndrome is now frequently advertised direct-to-consumer, and thus while this may enhance awareness it may result in patients seeking treatment for milder or other conditions not well-studied,"" he explained.\n\nThe harms of medications may outweigh benefits for these individuals, Wilt said. ""Up to 25 to 50 percent with even moderate to severe and longstanding symptoms stop taking these medications after more than a year due to either side effects or lack of benefit,"" he noted.\n\nNonetheless, for people with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome symptoms, these medications provided important benefits, at least in the short term, Wilt said.\n\nPatients should tell their doctors if they have bothersome sensations in their legs that include distressing, irresistible urge to move them that is relieved by rest, Wilt said.\n\n""This may be due to restless legs syndrome or other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is important. Effective treatments for restless legs syndrome are available, and in patients with more severe symptoms may include medications,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on restless legs syndrome, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']",The story could have provided more helpful context about potential benefits of the drugs in question.  But the story’s warning about the potential for disease-mongering in this area was especially salient.,"The story induced some uncomfortable cognitive dissonance that should have been resolved. The publication of a study, and this associated news coverage, implies that there is some “news” about treatments for restless leg syndrome to report. But an expert source goes unchallenged when he says, “There is nothing new here at all.” So either there’s news here which the story doesn’t adequately explain, or the expert source is right and there’s no news. The story would have been better had it firmly addressed this uncertainty.

The results of this pilot study, published in the peer-reviewed journal European Neuropsychopharmacology, suggest that this may become an effective medical treatment for patients with cocaine addiction, although a larger trial is needed to confirm the initial findings.\n\nCocaine use is widespread in the Western World. Last year, 2.3 million young Europeans (aged 15 to 34) used cocaine, and the US National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that 1.4 million Americans suffer from cocaine addiction1. There is no effective drug treatment for cocaine addiction, with behavioural therapies being the main element of any treatment regime. Now a group of researchers working in Italy and the USA have shown in a preliminary clinical study that cocaine use can be reduced by treatment with rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation).\n\nAs author, Dr Antonello Bonci (Scientific Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Adjunct Professor, John Hopkins University, Baltimore) said:\n\n""Despite the fact that more than 20 million people worldwide suffer from cocaine use disorders2, there are no effective neurobiological treatments for patients with this devastating condition"".\n\nThe practical work was conducted by team of scientists led by Dr Luigi Gallimberti, from the University of Padova Medical School, Italy, who enrolled 32 patients who were seeking treatment for cocaine addiction at the hospital clinic. The participating patients were randomized to receive either rTMS or standard symptom-relieving medications.\n\nThe experimental group received one rTMS session per day for five days, and then once a week for the following three weeks, for a total of 8 TMS sessions over 29 days. Those in the control group received pharmacological treatment for symptoms associated with cocaine addiction (such as depression, anxiety and sleep problems). The study indicated the safety of rTMS in patients with cocaine addiction. There was significantly less craving and there were a significantly higher number of cocaine-free urine drug tests in the rTMS compared to the control group. In addition, 69% (11/16) patients) in the experimental group showed no relapse to cocaine use, whereas only 19% (3/16) patients) in the control group showed a similar positive result (the results are adjusted for patients who dropped out of the trial).\n\nDr Bonci said: ""rTMS is a non-invasive and very safe therapeutic approach which is used with other mental health and neurological conditions, such as depression and neuropathic pain. Our study suggests that rTMS may also represent a new treatment for patients with cocaine use disorder"".\n\nAt the end of the first 29 days of the experiment, the experimental group was given the option of continuing the treatment, whereas those in the control group were given the possibility of receiving the same rTMS treatment as the experimental group for 63 days. Results further confirmed the beneficial effects of rTMS in helping patients to maintain abstinence from cocaine.\n\nDr. Bonci continued: We consider this study promising but preliminary. We need to replicate the work in a bigger group of patients using sham-TMS as the control condition. As far as we know, this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rTMS treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use. It is also important to emphasize that, in this study patients were seeking treatment for their cocaine addiction in a hospital setting: the group studied, albeit small, was a ""real world"" sample. We have continued to follow patients from the trial, and the improvement seems to be sustained over time, up to 12 months, although we don\'t have any hard data on that yet. It is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial.\n\nWe decided to target an area of the brain involved in decision making, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL PFC). This was because previous animal studies from our lab had shown that compulsive cocaine-seeking was associated with hypoactivity in the prelimbic cortex, which is a brain area that shares similar behavioural roles to the DL PFC. Importantly, we had found that increasing the activity in the prelimbic cortex could significantly reduce cocaine self-administration"".\n\nCommenting European Neuropsychopharmacology editor, Dr Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg (Mannheim) said,\n\n""This study represents a creative approach to a disorder that is notoriously difficult to treat in the real world. These pilot data also show that biological treatments nowadays reach far beyond medications and that new neuroscience methods may be used for targeted changes in brain regions relevant for complex mental disorders"".\n\n###']",This news release on magnetic brain stimulation to combat cocaine addiction has something we don’t often see in releases — lots of underscoring of the research limitations.,"This release reports the findings from a small pilot study asking whether rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) to certain parts of the brain in cocaine users can limit their use and affect their cravings for the drug. The results showed a decrease in both use and cravings for cocaine among the experimental group, as compared to a control group which only received medicinal drugs to address the effects of cocaine. The release did not address costs or the availability of rTMS treatments; otherwise it was a good, readable overview of an intriguing study.

Chemotherapy before surgery might provide a false assurance that there\'s no more residual cancer, whereas microscopic tumour may remain after the surgery, leading to cancer recurrence and possibly, death.\n\nThe surgery should be aggressive in an attempt to remove all visible signs of the tumour, and to avoid leaving any residual disease. The goal is to have no cancer visible to the naked eye of the surgeon after the surgery.\n\nSurgery should be followed by intraperitoneal, or localized, chemotherapy delivered to the abdomen. Localized chemotherapy works best if there\'s no residual cancer after the initial surgery. It is the combined effect of surgery and chemotherapy that works best.\n\n""For decades, women have been treated with a combination of treatment options, resulting in poor prognosis for most women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, but there are many survivors as well,"" said Dr. Narod, senior scientist at Women\'s College Research Institute.\n\n""Women need support to endure surgery and the rigours of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, but should be encouraged to do so whenever possible, considering the potential survival benefits,"" said Narod. ""We should offer all women the possibility of a cure.""\n\n###']",Would changing the chemo-surgery treatment order and adding an adjunct chemotherapy in patients with late-stage ovarian cancer vastly improve their chance for survival? We wish this release had provided more details.,"This news release summarizes a review article published in Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology which assesses the available evidence and makes recommendations concerning the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. The author of the review argues that adopting a more aggressive standard of treatment for this cancer type that involves locally directed adjuvant chemotherapy could increase cure rates from 20% to 50%. The news release uses some of the language in the review but, unsurprisingly, it appears more optimistic than the perspective piece. The release doesn’t address costs or harms related to such a course of  treatment, nor does it give readers any information about how the original article reached the conclusion that survival rates could be increased up to 50 percent.

Pain relief was sustained in six patients who continued treatment for one year. All patients received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to their primary motor cortex once a week for at least 12 weeks.\n\nSatisfactory relief was considered a 40 - 69 percent reduction in pain scores (6 patients) and excellent relief, pain reduction of 70 percent or more (5 patients). Overall, 8 patients who had severe stroke-caused dysesthesias, such as uncomfortable numbness or prickling, experienced less relief than patients without severe dysesthesias, suggesting possible neural circuit damage was inhibiting response to treatment.\n\nThe study participants had all been treated medically after a blood clot or bleed in one side of the brain (unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke). Several weeks into their recovery, they had begun to experience severe hand or leg pain as a consequence of brain damage from the stroke. Such central post-stroke pain can be extremely disabling and difficult to treat, impacting general functioning, mood, and overall quality of life.\n\nSince the 1990s, Japan has been an active center of research into the study of electrical motor cortex stimulation (EMCS) to treat post-stroke pain using surgically implanted devices. The study reported at the INS 12th World Congress builds on observations that electrical motor cortex stimulation’s effectiveness in relieving central post-stroke pain can be predicted by rTMS, suggesting the techniques share similar pain-relief mechanisms.\n\nHowever, Kobayashi and colleagues point out in their peer-reviewed online publication of this study, “Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Once a Week Induces Sustainable Long-Term Relief of Central Poststroke Pain” (Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface: April 23, 2015)[1] that there has still been controversy about the efficacy of rTMS in post-stroke pain. Kobayashi said in comparison to EMCS, his impression is rTMS efficacy seemed almost the same, without requiring surgery.\n\nIn 2014, a review[2] suggested that there is probable efficacy (a level A recommendation) for short-term rTMS treatment of neuropathic pain, including central post-stroke pain, but did not speak to long-term efficacy.\n\nSince pain relief from rTMS increases a few days after treatment, weekly treatment sessions were selected to try to sustain pain relief at treatment intervals that could be maintained on an outpatient basis.\n\nKobayashi believes neurologists would especially have an interest in this method, which is also attractive due to its low side-effect profile. None of the 18 patients reported any serious side effects from weekly sessions of 10 trains of 10-second 5Hz rTMS, at 90 percent of the active motor threshold. Two patients reported transient, slight scalp discomfort after rTMS.\n\nIn addition to the potential of rTMS in pain relief, there has been growing research into noninvasive stimulation to augment progress in physical rehabilitation soon after stroke. It is believed that the stimulation aids in plasticity, the ability of the brain to gradually form new neural connections to take on functions previously performed by damaged areas.\n\nA first phase of the study assessed whether rTMS had a treatment effect on pain. In it, the research team randomly assigned six patients to receive either sham or active rTMS one week and the other treatment the next, measuring pain scores before and after each session.\n\nOnce that phase had shown that rTMS did reduce the patients’ pain, an open-label treatment phase began. In this second phase, the 18 patients underwent 12 weekly rTMS sessions. The patients’ pain scores were measured just before each weekly session.\n\nData were collected for eight years, ending in 2014. Kobayashi said that some patients really hoped to continue rTMS after the study because their pain worsened after rTMS treatment sessions were over, and almost all the patients said that after the study ended, their pain increased to the level before rTMS.\n\nHe added that the remaining question to answer is whether the level of the patients’ severe uncontrollable pain would continue to decrease if rTMS continued for several years.\n\n']",This release didn’t mention the limitations of an open-label study that had only 18 patients. Such context is crucial for readers to understand how much weight to give to the study.,"NIH illustration of rTMS therapy.
This news release speaks to the results of a small open-label study examining the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients who have suffered a stroke. The 18 patients studied all had chronic pain as a consequence of their stroke and did not obtain adequate relief from more traditional approaches. The release includes useful background about the burden of post-stroke pain and the history of research into rTMS as a treatment option. But the study’s small size and lack of control group are key limitations that should have been commented on, but weren’t. We also think that since the device is commercially available and is in widespread use for depression, cost should have mentioned as well as a few words about other treatment options.

""Athletes who drank the milk, compared to those who did not, scored higher after the season than before it started, specifically in the areas of verbal and visual memory.""\n\nFootball players were tested before the season, after concussions and post-season using Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing, also called ImPACT™, a widely used computer-based evaluation for concussions. Overall, 36 variables for attention span, working memory, sustained and selective attention time, response variability, non-verbal problem solving and reaction time were measured in the study.\n\nExperimental groups drank Fifth Quarter Fresh after each practice and game, sometimes six days a week, while control groups did not consume the chocolate milk. Analysis was performed on two separate groups: athletes who experienced concussions during the season and those who did not. Both non-concussed and concussed groups showed positive effects from the chocolate milk.\n\nNon-concussed athletes who drank Maryland-produced Fifth Quarter Fresh showed better cognitive and motor scores over nine test measures after the season as compared to the control group.\n\nConcussed athletes drinking the milk improved cognitive and motor scores in four measures after the season as compared to those who did not.\n\nThe remaining test scores did not show a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups over the season, according to Shim.\n\nHe suggested that the naturally occurring high levels of specific nutrients in Fifth Quarter Fresh likely contributed to the results.\n\n""Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are important for energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain,"" said Shim. ""Previous studies have shown that BCAA supplementation has resulted in improved cognition in mice with brain injuries.""\n\nShim also cited carbohydrates, calcium and electrolytes, all of which he says are likely to be critical for the recovery process after brain injuries.\n\nWhile the study\'s results indicate a strong link between milk and the reduction of concussion-related symptoms, researchers caution that more in-depth studies are necessary to be conclusive.\n\nFifth Quarter Fresh is a fat-free chocolate milk made by combining nutrient-rich milk (yielding 40 percent more protein, calcium and electrolytes than conventional milk) with the benefits of a pasteurization process that preserves proteins and makes them easier for the body to absorb, according to the company.\n\nFifth Quarter Fresh has a balance of fast-absorbed whey and sustained-release casein proteins that provide a quick burst of amino acids followed by a continuous supply over several more hours, according to Richard Doak, co-founder of Fifth Quarter Fresh.\n\nThe company maintains that protecting student athletes and helping them perform at a higher level was the reason they created Fifth Quarter Fresh in the first place.\n\n""We believe there is a real need to improve nutrition for young athletes. Fifth Quarter Fresh may help them prevent injuries by providing their bodies with the nutrients they need to heal and repair. This study suggests that,"" said Doak. ""Our milk provides 20 grams of protein and five grams of undamaged BCAAs per 14-ounce serving—naturally. We use no supplements and no preservatives—it is fresh chocolate milk.""\n\nOfficials in Washington County, Md., home to all seven high schools participating in the study, are now considering the broad adoption of Fifth Quarter Fresh in sports programs throughout its school system.\n\n""There is nothing more important than protecting our student-athletes,"" said Clayton Wilcox, superintendent of Washington County Public Schools. ""Now that we understand the findings of this study, we are determined to provide Fifth Quarter Fresh to all of our athletes.""\n\nEarlier this year, UMD released the preliminary results of a study showing that Fifth Quarter Fresh outperformed leading commercial workout recovery drinks for endurance recovery by 13-17 percent.\n\nFifth Quarter Fresh is produced through the Hagerstown-based Lanco-Pennland Quality Milk Producers, a farmer-owned, farmer-run cooperative with nearly 650 members that spans the U.S. East Coast. Frederick-based Dairy Maid Dairy bottles it.\n\nThe University of Maryland study was made possible by the Maryland Industrial Partnerships (MIPS) program, which jointly funds commercial product development projects teaming Maryland companies with University of Maryland faculty.\n\nFor photos and videos, visit http://go.umd.edu/concussions.\n\nAbout the Maryland Industrial Partnerships (MIPS) Program\n\nMIPS, a program of the Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute (Mtech) in the A.

They are almost absent from this boastful release touting vague neurological benefits of a specific chocolate milk. The release says high school football players, including some who suffered concussions, who drank the milk improved their scores on a computer-based concussion evaluation, but the release not only doesn’t say how much improvement was seen, it doesn’t even say which of the 36 measurements in the test improved. The release highlights the protein, calcium and electrolyte content of the milk, without ever mentioning each serving also contains the equivalent of eight teaspoons of sugar. Perhaps the most worrisome aspect of this case is the status of the “study” it is based on. The study does not appear to have been independently reviewed or published.
This review and a related blog post calling attention to the issues raised within have sparked much news coverage and led to a University of Maryland investigation into policies surrounding research quality, conflict of interest, and public relations. More links to our coverage can be found here.

British researchers presented the disappointing findings Thursday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas.\n\n""As a whole, the study is negative,"" study author Dr. Robert Coleman, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield in England, said during a Thursday news conference on the findings. ""There is no overall difference in recurrence rates or survival rates [between patients who got the bone drug and those who did not], except in older patients, defined as more than five years after menopause.""\n\nThat was a possible bright spot in the results.\n\n""In that population, there is a benefit,"" Coleman said. The older women had a 27 percent improvement in recurrence and a 29 percent improvement in overall survival over the five-year follow-up, compared to those who didn\'t get the drug.\n\n""There was tremendous hope that this [drug] approach would be a major leap forward,"" Coleman noted. ""There have been other trials that suggest this is the case."" In one previous study, the use of the drug was linked with a 32 percent improvement in survival and lowered recurrence in younger women with breast cancer.\n\nOther research has found that healthy women on bone drugs were less prone to develop breast cancer, so experts were hoping the drugs had an anti-tumor effect.\n\nZometa, marketed by Novartis AG, is used to relieve pain when cancers have spread to the bone -- in part, by slowing bone erosion caused by the disease. It is given intravenously, while other bisphosphonates such as Actonel, Fosamax or Boniva can be taken orally.\n\nIn the trial, known as AZURE (Adjuvant Treatment with Zoledronic Acid in State II/III Breast Cancer), Coleman and his colleagues evaluated 3,360 breast cancer patients from 174 participating centers, all with stage II or III cancers but no evidence of metastases (cancer that has spread beyond the original site). About half received the bone drugs plus standard therapy; half just got standard therapy.\n\nThe focus was on disease-free survival. After five years, about 400 women in each group either died or had recurrences.\n\nWhen Coleman\'s team looked at subgroups, however, they found the benefit among older women, a finding they say warrants more study.\n\n""The younger patients are getting no benefit,"" Coleman said. ""If anything, they are doing a little bit worse.""\n\nIn addition, there were some troubling side effects among women taking Zometa, including 17 cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (a severe bone disease that can result in death of the jawbone).\n\nDr. Sharon Giordano, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, was not involved in the study but put it in perspective. Bisphosphonates have been used to treat osteoporosis as well as bone complications of breast cancer treatment, she said.\n\n""The role of bisphosphonates in preventing cancer recurrence has been less clear,"" she said, noting that multiple studies have had conflicting findings.\n\nAs for the benefit found in postmenopausal women, she said, ""I would consider this hypothesis-generating and not practice-changing.""\n\nOther studies underway may provide a clearer answer, she said.\n\nSince the current study was presented at a meeting, its findings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nSaid Coleman: ""Zoledronic acid cannot be routinely recommended for prevention of cancer returning, but it remains a very good drug for patients where the cancer has already spread to the bone.""\n\nColeman disclosed receiving speaker fees from Novartis; the researchers also received academic grant funding from the drug maker.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on bisphosphonates, visit U.S. Food and Drug Administration.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">When something doesn’t work, say so.

Its clarity, and cautious interpretation of this clinical trial, make it stand out in comparison with the other story we reviewed on this topic. The story accurately described the main conclusions of the study and did not oversell the promise of a subgroup analysis showing that zoledronic acid might give post-menopausal women a survival advantage. The story pointed out specific adverse events, including bone disease in the jaws of some women in the trial.It pointed out financial support from the pharmaceutical company that sells the drug being studied. The article wasn’t perfect. It didn’t explain the regulatory status of zoledronic acid for women with early breast cancer.  It expressed the survival advantage of the subgroup of post-menopausal women in relative rather than absolute terms. But then so did the study summary provided by the drug company which sponsored the trial.
 
Journalists have limited access to study information at meeting presentations. And the author of the Healthday article was careful to point out that the results of AZURE should be regarded as preliminary.

The unusual fractures that may be associated with certain osteoporosis drugs called bisphosphonates occur lower on the bone. Ironically, that\'s where the femur, the longest bone in the body, is usually strongest.\n\nThese unusual fractures can occur suddenly without any trauma, such as a fall. And they can be complex breaks that are difficult to fix and slow to heal.\n\nIn the study, published in current issue of JAMA, researchers looked at 716 of these fractures in more than 200,000 Ontario women who had taken bisphosphonates.\n\nWomen who had taken the drugs for five years or longer had nearly a three times higher risk of suffering atypical fractures compared with women who had only transient exposure to such drugs.\n\nThat\'s called the relative risk, and it seems alarming. But the ""absolute risk"" of these unusual fractures is still pretty low — 13 fractures per year for every 10,000 people taking bisphosphonates for five years or longer. That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent.\n\nMoreover, the study verified that long-term use of bisphosphonate drugs reduces the risk of typical osteoporosis fractures by 24 percent. That\'s obviously a lot more benefit than risk.\n\n""The big message really is the number of typical hip fractures is much, much larger than the number of unusual thigh fractures,"" says Dr. Gillian Hawker of St. Michael\'s Hospital in Ontario, an osteoporosis specialist and study author. ""So although we believe there is an increased risk of these unusual fractures, it doesn\'t outweigh the benefit"" of taking osteoporosis drugs.\n\nMerck, which makes Fosamax, the original and leading bisphosphonate drug, criticizes the new study. The company said in a statement to Shots that women who had atypical fractures were different from those who didn\'t. For instance, they started out with a history of more fractures, so the comparison isn\'t valid.\n\n""Merck believes that the results must be interpreted with caution and should not be overstated,"" says the company\'s statement.\n\nStill, the accumulating evidence that there is a risk of these serious, unusual fractures associated with bisphosphonates is getting a lot of attention in the medical community.\n\nLast fall the Food and Drug Administration issued a ""safety update"" urging doctors and patients to be on the lookout for the problem. Often, the FDA says, an atypical fracture is preceded by pain in the thigh, apparently from a small stress fracture that signals bone weakness. ""Although it is not clear if bisphosphonates are the cause, these unusual femur fractures have been predominantly reported in patients taking bisphosphonates,"" the FDA says.\n\nThe concern is heightened by another, even rarer possible side effect – osteonecrosis of the jaw. Basically, it means that part of the jawbone dies.\n\nSome reports – including one published earlier this month in the Journal of Dental Research — have found a higher risk of the jaw problem in dental patients taking bisphosphonates.\n\nAgain, Merck disputes the connection. Earlier this month it convinced a New Jersey jury that Fosamax did not cause one woman\'s jaw problems.\n\nAmid all the debate, many specialists are wondering if women on bisphosphonates should take a ""holiday"" from the drug from time to time. The idea is that perhaps they\'d get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures. ""You could do five years on, five years off,"" Dr. Clifford Rosen, a bone specialist at Maine Medical Center, tells Shots. ""Some people are doing three on and three off.""\n\nBut at some point, should these patients start taking the drug again? ""I don\'t think anybody knows,"" Rosen says. ""The thought is you would have to put them back on at some time.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Good job of explaining a potentially confusing study. Extra points for including discussion of relative vs. absolute risk. Extra points for explaining a “thigh” fracture that is not near the hip.</span>","There was a very clear explanation of the difference between relative and absolute risk.  And a very clear summary statement: “That’s obviously a lot more benfit than risk.”
The story ends with another strong point: discussing some of the issues that women should be discussing with their doctors in a truly informed shared decision-making environment.

2091,story_reviews_01569,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/2830/,2010-05-03 20:18:01,Magnetic brain stimulation fights depression,"['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A daily dose of electricity delivered to a specific part of the brain can lift depression, new research confirms, even for people who’ve already tried multiple antidepressants to no avail.\n\nWhile there’s evidence that this technique, known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), helps depressed people get better-and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved TMS for this purpose-many skeptics have questioned whether it really works, notes Dr. Mark S. George of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, the lead author of the new study.\n\nThe biggest issue with studies so far, he explained, has been that it’s tough to fake the sound and sensation of the real device in order to run a gold standard clinical trial in which some people get the treatment, and others get a sham treatment, no one knowing which.\n\nBut George and his team say they’ve solved that problem by developing a dummy device that clicks in a similar way to the real thing and causes a person’s eye muscles to twitch, just like real a TMS device.\n\nIn the May issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, George and his colleagues report the results of their 190-patient study, the most rigorous investigation of TMS for depression so far. The researchers randomly assigned participants to receive 37.5 minutes of TMS delivered to a part of the brain region that plays a role in emotion, or 37.5 minutes of sham TMS, once a day for three weeks.\n\nAfter three weeks, 14 percent of patients in the real TMS group had recovered from their depression, compared to 5 percent of the sham TMS group; people who had the real treatment were four times as likely to get better as those who got the fake treatment.\n\nBased on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover.\n\nEighty-eight percent of the study participants completed the first phase of the trial. Patients in both groups were equally likely to report side effects, which included headache, discomfort at the TMS site, and eye twitching.\n\nIn a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. Thirty percent of the patients in the second phase recovered from depression.\n\nHow long the treatment should last is not yet clear. “It’s very muddy now exactly how long we need to treat patients,” George said. “It looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up.”\n\nPatients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor — and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that’s been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects.\n\nTMS works by producing an electrical current that can pass through the skull and into the target area of the brain. George said he believes the approach works by “resetting” electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation.\n\nSomething similar is likely happening, he added, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or what is sometimes referred to as “electroshock treatment.” Sixty to 70 percent of depressed people who undergo ECT, in which electrodes placed on the front of the brain induce a convulsion while the patient is anesthetized, will recover.\n\nGeorge said he hopes that by better understanding where TMS should be delivered and by figuring out the best dose and duration of treatment, success rates closer to those of ECT might be achieved. “I’m optimistic that it’s pointing us in a path of understanding how to interact with the brain in a non-invasive way to get people well.”\n\nSOURCE: Archives of General Psychiatry, May 2010.']","A reasonably good story. More detailed info on costs, availability, and alternatives to TMS would have broadened the context for readers and increased the story’s overall usefulness.    ","A few key issues were missed:
Finally, it would have been ideal if the story had briefly mentioned the major treatment options for a patient with major depression who fails the first treatment:  change in medication or combinations of medication, psychotherapy with or without medication, and neurostimulation such as TMS or ECT.  An independent expert perspective could have helped with this.
