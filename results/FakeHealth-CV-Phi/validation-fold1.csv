The impairment may be temporary or permanent and incapacitating.\n\nThe problem has become more frequent as the population ages and also as a growing number of older adults undergo surgical procedures made possible by more advanced medical technology. Data from the scientific literature suggest a rise in mortality from POCD in the first year after surgery under general anesthesia.\n\nThe good news, according to a Brazilian study published by the journal PLoS One, is that two relatively simple measures can help to reduce the incidence of POCD: administering a small dose of the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone immediately before an operation and avoiding profound anesthesia during the operation.\n\nOpinions on the adequate depth of anesthesia and the risks of very profound anesthesia currently diverge. Excessively superficial anesthesia is known to incur a risk of patient recall of the procedure, which is undesirable.\n\n""Our findings confirm recent evidence that the deeper the anesthesia-induced hypnosis, the higher the incidence of POCD. The literature points to a link with the systemic inflammatory response induced by surgical trauma, damaging the central nervous system. If so, the use of an anti-inflammatory drug may have a protective effect,"" said Maria José Carvalho Carmona, a professor of anesthesiology at the University of São Paulo\'s Medical School (FM-USP) and principal investigator for the study.\n\nThe researchers evaluated 140 patients aged between 60 and 87 who underwent surgery under propofol-induced general anesthesia at the Central Institute of Hospital das Clínicas, FM-USP\'s teaching hospital, in most cases for removal of gallstones.\n\nPre-operative assessment included a battery of tests to measure mental and cognitive status. Patients who failed to achieve a cutoff score were excluded. The remaining subjects were divided randomly into four groups. In the operating room, deep anesthesia typical of major surgical procedures was induced in the first and third groups, and more superficial anesthesia in the second and fourth. Only the third and fourth groups received dexamethasone.\n\nThe depth of anesthesia was monitored using bispectral index (BIS) technology, which processes electroencephalogram signals to measure drug-induced unconsciousness. The researchers classified a BIS of 35-45 as deep anesthesia and a BIS of 46-55 as superficial anesthesia.\n\nIn the fourth group (superficial anesthesia with dexamethasone), the incidence of POCD was 15.3% immediately after surgery, but after six months the pre-operative cognitive status was restored in all patients.\n\n""The results reinforce recent evidence of the importance of avoiding deep anesthesia,"" Carmona said. ""With regard to the use of dexamethasone, more research is needed to confirm our finding, preferably in multicenter trials, but there are strong indications that it can be beneficial in many cases.""\n\nThe earliest trials with patients who developed POCD were performed after the 1950s. Before that, older patients were rarely subjected to major surgery, and significant research in this field has only been conducted for approximately 15-20 years.\n\n""The causes of and risk factors for POCD are still being discussed,"" she said. ""Little is said about rehabilitation or ways of helping patients recover pre-operative cognitive function.""\n\nOne of the obstacles to reliable diagnosis and rehabilitation is a lack of practical and secure instruments for pre- and post-operative cognitive assessment. ""The tests available today are either too time consuming or quick but unreliable,"" Carmona said. ""This makes it hard to follow up on patients.""\n\n###']","Harms, cost and context missing from news release on strategy for reducing cognitive dysfunction following anesthesia.","This news release focuses on a recent article published in the journal PLOS ONE, reporting that the use of the corticosteroid dexamethasone and avoiding “deep” or “profound” anesthesia during surgery can reduce the incidence of post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in older patients. However, the release does not give readers any context for understanding the reduced incidence of cognitive dysfunction after anesthesia, and does not discuss costs or potential harms associated with dexamethasone use.

The large, clear, electrically cooled jugs with a push lever for fast dispensing were placed in 483 school cafeterias, about 40 percent of schools during the 2008-2009 and the 2012-2013 school years.\n\nSchools with water dispensers saw a modest weight drop among students, according to the study by researchers from NYU Langone Medical Center, New York University\'s Institute for Education and Social Policy, and the Center for Policy Research at Syracuse University\'s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.\n\n""We associated these water dispensers with almost a one percentage point reduction in the likelihood of being overweight for boys and a little over a half a percentage point reduction for girls,"" said lead researcher Brian Elbel, an associate professor of population health and health policy at NYU School of Medicine.\n\nDoctors\' advice for preventing childhood obesity\n\n""Even a small, straightforward, relatively inexpensive policy intervention was associated with a small but statistically significant drop,"" Elbel told CBS News.\n\nWater jets also were linked with a decrease in the amount of half-pints of milk students bought, which could be a potential mechanism of weight reduction, the researchers found.\n\nModern water dispensers may be more effective than old-fashioned water fountains since water quality and cleanliness may deter kids from using older fountains, and they\'re not as efficient at serving large numbers of children, experts noted in an accompanying editorial.\n\nThe editorial, entitled ""Power of a Simple Intervention to Improve Student Health: Just Add Water,"" said the study\'s findings are significant.\n\n""Sometimes, a very simple intervention can have a powerful effect,"" wrote Lindsey Turner, of Boise State University, in Idaho, and Erin Hager, from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in Baltimore.\n\n""The study by Schwartz and colleagues in this issue of JAMA Pediatrics adds to a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of providing drinking water access in schools. In this study, the findings demonstrate that water access in schools can promote healthy weight outcomes among students,"" Turner and Hager said.']",CBS covers a lot of ground in this short report on water coolers in schools but missed some key details.,"Despite it being a fairly short report, CBS covers a lot of ground: it quantifies the benefits in absolute terms, outlines the study design and weighs the advantages of modern water dispensers against “old-fashioned” water fountains. But in other areas, the story falls short. There is no mention of costs and of study limitations. Although it quotes from the accompanying JAMA Pediatrics editorial, the CBS story doesn’t feature any critical perspectives on the study. We would have liked a closer look at some of the study’s shortcomings, which could have been achieved by comments from an independent source, or someone who was not involved in the study. More context on where this study fits in “the growing body of evidence” would have also been welcome.
Finally, word choice could have been better. CBS refers to the JAMA editorial and writes that “the study’s findings are significant.” However, “statistically significant” has a different meaning than what the public believes is “significant.” The distinction should be clear, or another word should be used.

Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is considered the gold standard for determining the percent of stenosis, or narrowing, due to plaque in a coronary artery. However, the degree of stenosis on ICA is not always an accurate predictor of heart attack risk because it gives no information on perfusion, or the flow of blood into the heart muscle. Inadequate perfusion, also known as ischemia, is a potential danger to the patient.\n\n""In lesions with less than 50 percent narrowing, one in five lesions still produce an ischemia,"" said study coauthor Philipp A. Kaufmann, M.D., professor and chair of nuclear medicine, and director of cardiac imaging at University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland.\n\nCardiac hybrid imaging combines coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) to provide information on both stenosis and perfusion. The approach has shown promise in studies focusing on short-term observations, but information is lacking on long-term outcomes.\n\nThe research team looked at 428 patients who underwent hybrid imaging. During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, a total of 160 major adverse cardiac events, including 45 deaths, were observed in the final study population. Patients with matched findings--stenosis of 50 percent or more on CCTA with evidence of ischemia on SPECT in the area of the heart to which the blocked vessel was supplying blood--had more than five times the risk of adverse events than those with normal findings. Patients with unmatched findings, or evidence of ischemia but not in the area of the heart being fed by the stenotic artery, had three times the risk. Major adverse cardiac event rates were 21.8 percent for matched findings and 9.0 percent for unmatched--considerably higher than the 2.4 percent rate for normal findings.\n\nThe results show that cardiac hybrid imaging is an excellent long-term predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients evaluated for coronary artery disease. Dr. Kaufmann said that hybrid imaging findings could help guide treatment decisions, such as whether or not a patient should have a revascularization procedure such as bypass or angioplasty.\n\n""In patients with multiple lesions or complex coronary anatomy, it is, in many cases, very difficult to correctly identify the culprit lesion,"" he said. ""In a previous multicenter trial, with hybrid imaging we were able to see that about one in five patients should be revascularized in another coronary artery than originally planned. The present study now documents the prognostic importance of the comprehensive assessment provided by hybrid imaging.""\n\nThe study supports CCTA use for an initial, noninvasive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. No additional imaging would be necessary if the results were normal. If a lesion was evident, then clinicians could employ a nuclear scan to assess ischemia and take advantage of both modalities by fusing the results together to make a hybrid image.\n\n""The strategy of direct referral to invasive coronary angiography without noninvasive imaging is obsolete,"" Dr. Kaufmann said. ""Even after documenting coronary artery disease with coronary CT angiography, we need further noninvasive evaluation before deciding upon revascularization versus medication.""\n\nThe researchers hope to run a trial to show that hybrid imaging can have a positive impact on patient outcomes. They are also looking at what they call ""triple hybrid"" imaging, which combines the CCTA/SPECT hybrid with information on coronary artery shear stress. The shear stress information could help identify lesions that do not yet have an impact on ischemia but will in the future.\n\n###\n\n""Hybrid SPECT Perfusion Imaging and Coronary CT Angiography: Long-Term Prognostic Value for Cardiovascular Outcomes.""

With coronary angiograms, dye is injected into the arteries and then imaged with an x-ray machine to show areas of narrowing in coronary blood vessels. The hybrid approach described here, based on a published study, involves the combination of two other imaging techniques —  coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) — to produce what the release says is a more accurate picture of cardiac blood flow. That information can supposedly help identify which patients need coronary artery interventions like angioplasty and bypass surgery.
While the release does a nice job explaining the science behind the hybrid approach and the rationale for its use, there is a mismatch between the overstated headline and the more accurate language featured in the release’s conclusion. The headline describes the hybrid approach as an “effective tool” for evaluating coronary artery disease; the last paragraph acknowledges that the approach hasn’t been tested in a clinical trial and that we don’t know if it actually has a positive impact on patient outcomes.
The lack of any clear patient benefit shouldn’t be treated like an afterthought.

REUTERS/Nicolas Misculin\n\nThey found daily supplements of soy germ isoflavones reduced the sudden sweats more than inactive placebo pills after six months.\n\nBut a U.S. expert wasn’t convinced by the results, which run counter to other published studies.\n\n“The majority of them are showing no benefit,” said William W. Wong, a nutrition researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who wasn’t involved in the new work.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Menopause, is based on 90 Chinese women. A third of them received placebo pills made of starch, while the rest took soy germ isoflavones, either 84 or 126 milligrams a day.\n\nThey all kept diaries of their hot flashes and filled out questionnaires about various problems tied to menopause, including hot flashes, sweating, insomnia, tiredness and headache.\n\nAt six months, their Kupperman scores — a measure of symptom severity that ranges from 0 to 63 — had dropped by more than 40 percent from an initial value of about 25 in the soy groups.\n\nThe number of hot flashes also fell from about 20 a week to less than 10.\n\nWhile the same pattern was seen in the placebo group, it was less pronounced. Their symptom score dropped by 29 percent and the number of hot flashes by 35 percent, according to Dr. Yan-bin Ye of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.\n\nThe work was supported by Frutarom Netherlands, which also donated the supplements.\n\nWong cautioned that the new study was small and that the women involved only had few hot flashes. He said it was “hard to believe” that soy would have an effect on these women.\n\nIn one of his own studies, Wong found no effect on soy germ isoflavones among women who took the supplements for two years.\n\nThe standard drug treatment for stubborn menopause symptoms is hormone replacement therapy. But doctors and women have become increasingly wary of that option because of serious side effects such as increased risk for heart attack, stroke and breast cancer.\n\n“It is something they need to gauge, is it worth the risk?” Wong told Reuters Health.\n\nHe generally recommends exercise and an active lifestyle to women who feel bothered by menopause.\n\nSoy supplements also have side effects such as nausea, bloating, and constipation, according to the National Institutes of Health. A month’s supply costs about $12, while a month of hormone tablets runs between $40 and $60.\n\nWong said that in Asia, women tend to think of menopause problems as a natural part of life — not a medical problem.\n\n“There is a major cultural difference in how we deal with menopause symptoms,” he mused.\n\nThe new study didn’t find significant hormone changes in women who took soy supplements, and Wong said the compounds are probably safe for women.\n\n“Consuming soy is not bad for them,” Wong noted, “but it might be a waste of money if you don’t see any benefit.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/wVfw8S Menopause, online January 24, 2012.']",Five-star story on small study that tries to counter large body of evidence on soy supplements for hot flashes.,"Overall, this story addressed our criteria.
The big picture is that this is a small study, funded by pharma that showed a benefit for soy.  Put in the context of the many randomized clinical trials that have looked at this issue over the past decade, there are questions about this finding, and the story puts those doubts in readers’ minds.

19,story_reviews_00460,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/an-array-of-experts-make-this-stat-story-on-aspirin-study-very-strong/,2016-04-11 04:00:00,Experts debate: Do healthy people need an aspirin a day?,"['Individuals who have heart disease are often advised to take a low-dose aspirin every day to prevent blood clots that cause heart attacks and most strokes.\n\nSome healthy men and women should take aspirin every day to ward off heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer. That’s the final recommendation from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) after more than a year of study and lively public comment. The recommendations were published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nAspirin has been used for more than 100 years to ease fever and relieve pain. Many people with heart disease are advised to take a low-dose aspirin every day to prevent blood clots, the cause of heart attacks and most strokes. That’s called secondary prevention. Whether healthy individuals should do the same thing, a strategy called primary prevention, is controversial.\n\nThe FDA is against taking aspirin for primary prevention, arguing that the risks, including bleeding in the brain and stomach, outweigh the benefits. The USPSTF recommends it for men and women aged 50 to 59 who are at risk of heart attack or stroke. The dueling recommendations kicked off a lively debate in the medical community.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the clashing opinions, experts agree on two things: Aspirin should be just one part of an overall strategy to prevent heart attack and stroke that includes weight control, healthy eating, exercising, and not smoking. And don’t take aspirin without talking with your doctor.\n\nBeyond that, here’s a sample of expert opinions.\n\nKirsten Bibbins-Domingo: Task force says some will benefit\n\nCharles H. Hennekens: Balance between benefits and harms still hazy\n\nDeepak L. Bhatt: No easy way to identify who will benefit or be harmed\n\nCynthia Boyd and Milo Puhan: Add personal preferences to the equation\n\nFreek W.A. Verheugt: Even doctors are confused\n\nBy Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo: Taking aspirin is easy, but deciding whether or not to take aspirin for prevention is complex. Aspirin can help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and colorectal cancer, but it also increases the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force found that the benefits of taking low-dose aspirin daily clearly outweigh the harms for people who are 50 to 59 years old, who have increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and who are not at increased risk for bleeding. People who are 60 to 69 can also benefit from taking aspirin, but the risks for bleeding are higher in this age group. Some older individuals may be less likely to benefit from aspirin’s ability to prevent colorectal cancer because it takes about 10 years of daily aspirin for it to affect this risk.\n\nIt is important to note that this draft recommendation applies to people who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have at least a 10-year life expectancy, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily. Also, it is meant for people who do not already have cardiovascular disease.\n\nKirsten Bibbins-Domingo, MD, is vice-chair of the US Preventive Services Task Force. She is also professor of medicine and of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nBy Charles H. Hennekens: After more than 25 years of research on aspirin for primary prevention, we are not much further along than we were after the landmark findings from the Physicians Health Study in 1988. We know that taking aspirin will prevent a first heart attack and a first stroke, but we also know that aspirin can cause serious bleeding, mainly in the gastrointestinal system and, more rarely, in the brain.\n\nIn a meta-analysis of the six major randomized trials of aspirin for primary prevention, among more than 95,000 participants, serious cardiovascular events occurred in 0.51 percent of participants taking aspirin and 0.57 percent of those not taking aspirin. That corresponds to a 20 percent relative reduction in risk. At the same time, serious bleeding events increased from 0.07 percent among non-aspirin takers to 0.10 percent among those taking aspirin, or a 40 percent relative increase in risk.\n\nAlthough the totality of evidence is incomplete, it appears that aspirin has net benefits when the absolute 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular event is greater than 10 percent. Unfortunately, fewer than 5,000 of the trial participants have been in that risk category. (Individuals can calculate their 10-year risk using a relatively simple calculator from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute or a more complex one from the American Heart Association.)\n\nThese calculators don’t tell the whole story. Clinicians should evaluate additional risks and benefits. For example, some individuals are at higher risk of bleeding, such as those with a history of ulcers. Others are at higher risk of having a cardiovascular event because they are obese, physically inactive, or have a family history of such events.\n\nSeveral ongoing trials will provide information on aspirin’s benefit-to-risk ratio. This information is essential for making rational guidelines for aspirin in primary prevention.\n\nCharles H. Hennekens, MD, is professor of medicine at Florida Atlantic University. He was the principal investigator of the Physician’s Health Study, which was the first to demonstrate that aspirin prevents a first heart attack in men, and the Women’s Health Study, which was the first to demonstrate that aspirin prevents a first stroke in women.\n\nBy Deepak L. Bhatt: The use of aspirin for primary prevention is one of the most complex issues in medicine today. That’s ironic because aspirin is ubiquitous and most patients perceive it to be safe and harmless. After all, it is sold over the counter.\n\nHere’s the problem: The lower an individual’s risk of a future heart attack or ischemic stroke, the less he or she will benefit from taking daily low-dose aspirin. Yet the odds that aspirin will cause a problem, such as bleeding, remain relatively steady. That means for some low-risk individuals, taking daily aspirin could do more harm than good.\n\nIf there was a foolproof way to identify individuals at high risk for a future heart attack or stroke, as well as those at high risk for developing complications, we would know who should be taking aspirin for primary prevention and who should not. Unfortunately, no such tool exists.\n\nMany patients — and many health care providers — believe that the aspirin-for-primary-prevention issue is settled. Not so. In fact, several clinical trials now underway are looking at this very question. These include the ASCEND, TIPS-3, and ASPREE trials.\n\nThe data on aspirin for preventing colorectal cancer are provocative, but are even less robust than for primary prevention of cardiovascular events.\n\nDeepak L. Bhatt, MD, is executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBy Cynthia Boyd and Milo Puhan: Combining guidelines for the use of aspirin to prevent three different conditions — heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer — into a single recommendation makes good sense for patients. But making such recommendations is difficult because they must take into account so many factors.\n\nPersonal preferences are one very important factor. Say your mother had a disabling stroke, and you are willing to do everything you can to prevent having a stroke, even if it puts you at risk of bleeding. This might tip the balance in favor of taking aspirin. In contrast, someone who isn’t worried about having a cardiovascular event or developing colorectal cancer might want to stay away from aspirin to avoid bleeding.\n\nWith an international team of colleagues, we created an online tool that calculates whether the benefits of aspirin for primary prevention (preventing heart attack, ischemic stroke, and cancer) are greater than the harms (severe hemorrhagic stroke and severe gastrointestinal bleeds). The tool is based on research we recently published in BMC Medicine.\n\nTo use the tool, an individual enters his or her age group and sex and uses sliders to show how worried he or she is about six outcomes:\n\nsevere stroke\n\nheart attack\n\nsevere gastrointestinal bleeding\n\nvery severe, severe, or moderately severe cancer\n\nGreen, orange, and red boxes represent the benefit-harm balance corresponding to the user’s information.\n\nFor now, this tool is for research purposes only. It must be verified before it is ready for prime time. But it suggests a direction for decision aids that can help individuals choose whether to adopt preventive strategies like aspirin that come with potentially harmful side effects.\n\nCynthia M. Boyd, MD, is associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Milo A. Puhan, MD, is director of the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute and professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Zurich.\n\nBy Freek W.A. Verheugt: Who should take aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or ischemic stroke is a complex issue — even for cardiologists. A recent report with data on 120 medical practices serving 69,000 patients found huge variation in doctors’ approaches. In some practices, 70 percent of patients were inappropriately taking aspirin. Part of my job, and that of other cardiologists and clinicians, is to help our patients make good choices about aspirin, guiding those at high risk toward aspirin use and those at low risk away from it.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that other therapies, such as statins, have also been proven to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. These are often used in combination with aspirin. As I showed in a commentary in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, when combined with a statin, aspirin’s net benefit in primary prevention is almost completely lost.\n\nFreek W.A. Verheugt, MD, is professor of cardiology at the Heart-Lung Centre of the University Medical Centre of Nijmegen and is in the department of cardiology at Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis in Amsterdam, both in the Netherlands.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published on Dec. 11, 2015.']","With a wide array of independent sources, and a thorough discussion of the evidence quality, this story from STAT stands out for hitting all the important marks.","This is a detailed report on the recent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on the use of aspirin, one of two stories we reviewed on this topic (here’s the other, from CBSNEWS.com). It is a relatively thorough discussion, with an impressive array of physicians parsing the guidelines and informing us who is likely, or not likely to benefit from taking aspirin, the likelihood of benefit and harm, and the importance of gauging one’s personal set of risk factors before deciding if a daily aspirin is right for you.
One issue this story could have made clearer is the quality of evidence behind the task force’s recommendations. Some important limitations are discussed, but not in a direct way. This issue–the relatively thin evidence behind the recommendations–made the rounds among physician news sites, and ideally would have been emphasized more in general news coverage.

Previous studies have suggested that methods like these could be effective in reducing youngsters’ allergic, sometimes dangerous anaphylactic shock reactions to peanuts. The Australian team added probiotics to further enhance the gut’s ability to accept the peanuts and not trigger an immune reaction. Compared to 4% of children who didn’t get any treatment, 82% of those receiving the combination therapy significantly reduced their allergic reactions to peanuts.\n\nMORE: Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies\n\nIn the follow-up, which tracked the children for four years after they were treated with the combination therapy, 67% of those who got the combination probiotic and peanut therapy were comfortable eating peanuts, compared to only 4% of those who did not get the treatment. Fewer children in the treated group had an allergic reaction to the peanuts, and they also showed smaller reactions to skin prick tests with peanut allergen.\n\nThe results are encouraging, allowing the children who were treated to eat peanuts without fear of an allergic reaction. But it may be too early to call this a cure. The researchers believe that adding probiotics to the peanut allergens may be important in improving the children’s tolerance to the food, but Dr. Anna Nowak-Wegrzyn, an associate professor of pediatrics at Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai Hospital who was not involved in the study, notes that the researchers didn’t compare the effect of the probiotics themselves; they only compared children who received the probiotics along with immune therapy to those who didn’t get any treatment at all.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nIt makes sense that the probiotics may enhance the immunotherapy’s effect, since probiotics are beneficial bacteria in the gut, where food allergens are processed. “I think there is certainly a suggestion, but not hard proof, that the probiotics make a difference,” says Nowak-Wegrzyn. “The question for me would be if there is a difference between patients who were treated with [both] immunotherapy [in the form of low doses of peanuts] and probiotics, and those who were treated with just immunotherapy.”\n\nThat may have to wait for another study. But the new findings provide even more evidence that using peanuts to treat peanut allergy, and to re-train the immune system to be less allergic, can be effective.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.']","The research this story was based on involved fewer than 50 patients, only 24 of whom received the relevant treatment — something the story doesn’t tell readers.","The story focuses on a long-term follow-up study of patients with peanut allergies who had received immunotherapy and probiotics to minimize allergic response to peanuts.
A story in a nationwide publication that suggests there may be a “cure” for peanut allergies — such as the story we are reviewing here — would likely raise hopes for families and individuals living with peanut allergies. But those hopes would be unfounded. The research this story was based on involved fewer than 50 patients, only 24 of whom received the relevant treatment — something the story doesn’t tell readers. And the treatment was not universally successful at eliminating peanut allergy even for those 24 patients. What’s more, there is no discussion in the story of costs or risks associated with treatment.

However, the study was small, and results from a larger trial aren\'t expected for several years, he added.\n\nDoctors often recommend a ""watch and wait"" period for men with low-grade, or less aggressive, prostate tumors. But many patients and their families aren\'t comfortable waiting and opt to have surgery before it\'s deemed medically necessary. These findings suggest that taking vitamin D might help reduce the need for such radical treatment.\n\nBut Dr. Anthony D\'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston, said that this study was too small to reach any definitive conclusion about the value of vitamin D in fighting prostate cancer.\n\n""It\'s premature to make any conclusions,"" he said. The findings also need to be replicated in a much larger number of patients, D\'Amico said.\n\nD\'Amico stressed that men should not start taking vitamin D supplements in hopes of slowing or curing prostate cancer.\n\nVitamin D, known as the ""sunshine vitamin,"" is produced by the body when it\'s exposed to sun. It\'s also found in fortified dairy products and fatty fish.\n\nThe study results were scheduled for presentation Monday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.']","The claims made by one of the authors of a very small, short-term study — that vitamin D “made the cancer better” — deserved a more thorough analysis than this story provided. But the bottom line message was accurate.","This story describes a small study designed to see if taking vitamin D pills would slow or reverse low-grade prostate cancers. Since the results from a study like this are likely to generate a lot of interest and could influence patient decision-making, we’d like to see the claims evaluated and explored very thoroughly. The report perhaps too easily accepts the researcher’s conclusion that inflammation “is a driver of cancer,”  fails to adequately quantify the benefits seen in the treatment group, and doesn’t ask tough enough questions about how the study was conducted and its limitations. But although men and women who love their vitamin D may still read this article and run right to the supplementation aisle, the article does make a good faith effort to put the brakes on any runaway optimism over the benefits of the sunshine vitamin.

For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.’s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.’s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)\n\nOver two years, the injured knees were assessed using a comprehensive numerical score that rated pain, function during activity and other measures. At the time of the original injury, the knee also had been scored. At the end of the two years, both groups showed considerable improvement. The scores for the surgically repaired knees had risen by 39.2 points. The scores for the more conservatively treated knees also had risen, by 39.4 points. In other words, the outcomes were virtually identical. Despite a widespread belief that surgery leads to a stronger knee, the results showed that surgically reconstructing the A.C.L. as soon as possible after the tear “was not superior” to more conservative treatment, the study’s authors wrote. The findings suggest, the authors concluded, that “more than half the A.C.L. reconstructions” currently being conducted on injured knees “could be avoided without adversely affecting outcomes.”\n\nThis possibility should reverberate across playing fields nationwide, where, at the moment, preseason high school, collegiate and adult-league sports practices are under way, with a concomitant surge in A.C.L. tears. By one estimate, as many as 1 in every 556 fit, active people will tear an A.C.L. — particularly if they participate in sports that involve frequent pivoting and landing, like soccer, football, tennis, skiing and basketball. At the same time, the urge to treat the injury with surgery appears to be growing. The “belief among most surgeons and patients is that surgery is a ‘must,’ at least if you aim to go back into an active lifestyle,” the Swedish authors of the study e-mailed in response to questions.\n\nPart of the reason for A.C.L. surgery’s popularity is that by most measures, it works. In the current study, most of the group members who had reconstructive surgery reported that their injured knees felt healthy after two years and that they had returned to activity — not, in most cases, at the same level as before their injuries, but they were active. Significantly, their knees also were notably more “stable” than the joints that hadn’t been surgically fixed. Stability is, in theory, desirable. A stable knee rarely gives way.\n\nBut in practice, the importance of stability after A.C.L. treatment is “controversial,” The New England Journal study’s authors, Richard Frobell, Ph.D., and Stefan Lohmander, M.D., Ph.D., of Lund University, wrote in their e-mail. In an important 2009 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers retrospectively compared outcomes after 10 years in competitive athletes who had surgery or had opted for conservative treatment of their torn A.C.L.’s. The surgically repaired knees were notably more stable. But they weren’t fundamentally healthier. The surgically reconstructed knees and the conservatively treated joints experienced similar (and high) levels of early onset knee arthritis, a common occurrence after an A.C.L. tear. The treatments were almost identical, too, in terms of whether the athletes could return to sports and whether they reported subsequent knee problems.\n\nWhy, then, undergo A.C.L. reconstruction, an operation that can be expensive and, like all surgical procedures, carries risks? Several top-flight orthopedic surgeons I contacted say that they remain convinced that surgery leads to a better long-term outcome for certain patients, particularly if they want to return to pivoting sports. “The reason to have the surgery is to preserve” other parts of the knee from injury during activity, says Dr. Warren Dunn, an assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Vanderbilt University who has extensively studied A.C.L. tears. He points out that in The New England Journal of Medicine study, only 8 percent of the patients in the first surgical group subsequently tore a meniscus, a fragile pillow of cartilage that can rip if a knee gives way. Twenty-five percent of those in the physical therapy group eventually tore their meniscuses.\n\nWhat these numbers mean for anyone who tears an A.C.L. or is the parent of a young athlete in that situation is that they should have a long, frank conversation with an orthopedic surgeon and possibly also a nonsurgical sports-medicine specialist about options. “We recommend surgery based on activity level and sports,” Dr. Dunn says. “Most subjects can do in-line activities” like running or biking “without an A.C.L.” He adds, “On the other hand, we believe that A.C.L.-deficient subjects that do return” to sports involving cutting, pivoting or planting the leg “can consequently injure the meniscus” or other cartilage in the knee and would benefit from a replacement A.C.L.\n\nThe authors of the study are less sure. “On the basis of our study results, we’d tell patients” that “there is no apparent downside of starting a good rehab program and waiting with the surgery decision to see if it is needed or not,” the authors wrote to me.\n\nThe ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. “We definitely know only parts of the long-term outcome” after different A.C.L. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study.\n\nBut large-scale, randomized controlled studies, the gold standard of medical research, may be difficult to orchestrate, in part because people with shredded A.C.L.’s can balk at being denied surgery. In The New England Journal study, some of those assigned to physical therapy wound up requesting surgery, although they weren’t experiencing any knee problems. For them, it seems, “the desire to undergo surgery was based on expectations rather than symptoms,” the authors told me. It may be years, unfortunately, before we know if such expectations are justified or if unreconstructed injured knees can be fine.']","<span style=""font-size: larger;"">Excellent coverage overall, chock full of subtleties. </span>","The author took the time to dig into many facets of the evidence and explain their meaning for someone considering ACL surgery. As this is a topic of interest to many readers, including ""weekend warrior"" recreational athletes, it was good that the reporter did not gloss over the uncertainties in the science nor the human factors that play into this decision. We suggest a few areas where we think the story could’ve been strengthened further.

A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.\n\nYet, most heavy drinkers don\'t get the help they need.\n\n""The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,"" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nPart of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don\'t realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too.\n\n""I thought my only option was AA,"" John tells NPR. We\'ve agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business.\n\nHe\'s a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker — a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought ""solace in the bottle,"" he says.\n\n""I wanted to numb my thoughts,"" says John.\n\nHe\'d often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn\'t uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day.\n\nHe worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him.\n\n""She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,"" he recalls. ""Just absolutely furious.""\n\nHe went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services.\n\n""I would say John\'s story is not unique,"" DeSanto tells us. ""A lot of people are reluctant.""\n\nSometimes, traditional treatments — such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous — ""can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,"" she explains. ""There\'s stigma, shame and embarrassment.""\n\nDeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug.\n\n""Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,"" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.\n\nThe analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.\n\nSo, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.\n\n""It blunts the effects of alcohol,"" says Koob. ""People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it\'s not doing much for them.""\n\nThat was exactly John\'s experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn\'t get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn\'t want to keep drinking. ""I actually didn\'t feel the alcohol\'s effects,"" he says. ""It was startling.""\n\nIt\'s now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.\n\n""This is helping me,"" John says. ""I can go out with friends and not worry that I\'m going to end up inebriated or sloppy.""\n\nAccording to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review.\n\nMany physicians are ""unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,"" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.\n\nAny health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone — not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.\n\nAccording to the NIAAA, ""patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.""\n\nNaltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won\'t help everyone who has a drinking problem — especially if the disorder is severe.\n\n""I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings"" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine. He says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective.\n\nBut there\'s good evidence that the combination of counseling and drugs such as naltrexone can help people cut back on drinking, or move toward abstinence.']","This story shines a light on the underutilization of a useful drug, though it could have been a bit more thorough, exploring some of the caveats.","This NPR story explores a drug known as naltrexone for treating moderate to severe alcohol use disorder (formerly called “alcohol dependence”), and how some providers feel it is underutilized as a treatment option.
The story does a lot of things well–there are multiple sources included, and lots of general discussion on the evidence that supports the use of naltrexone, along with discussion on the complex nature of treating this problem.
However, we wish the story had done more to explain how well the medication works (or, in some cases, doesn’t work).  The cost of the medication and its side effects could also have been addressed more thoroughly.

Steve Byrd, MD, and colleagues of Pediatric Plastic Surgery Institute, Dallas. Dr. Byrd comments, ""The EarWell system is effective in eliminating or reducing the need for surgery in all but the most severe congenital ear malformations.""\n\nNonsurgical Treatment Avoids Later Consequences of Infant Ear Malformations\n\nThe researchers review their experience with nonsurgical correction of congenital ear malformations in 175 infants. The EarWell system is a relatively simple technique for molding and reshaping the ear, taking advantage of the increased malleability of the ear cartilage in newborns. For best results, treatment should start within the first three weeks after birth, or correspondingly later in infants born prematurely.\n\nThe technique and length of EarWell treatment varies according to the type and severity of the infant\'s ear deformity. Dr. Byrd and colleagues present a classification system and technical details for plastic surgeons to follow in evaluating the best treatment for specific types of malformations.\n\nFor most infants in the study, both ears were treated, for a total of 303 ears. Ninety-eight percent of infants had relatively mild ""constricted""-type ear deformities. EarWell treatment started at an average age of 12 days and continued for 37 days, including an average of six follow-up visits to the plastic surgeon\'s office.\n\nEarWell treatment was highly successful in correcting or reducing the severity of congenital ear malformations. Results were judged good to excellent in 97 percent of ears with one simple deformity and 88 percent with more complex ""mixed"" deformities. About 70 percent of ears with constricted malformations were graded as having no deformity after treatment.\n\nComplications consisted mainly of skin injuries that healed without further problems. In eight cases, treatment had to be stopped because of an allergic reaction to the adhesive tape used.\n\nWhile the EarWell system is not new, the report is the largest study of congenital ear malformations treated with this approach--including a standardized approach to treatment and assessment of the results. The results strongly support its use, especially in infants with deformities and less-severe malformations.\n\nBut lack of awareness of this nonsurgical alternative is a key limiting factor. ""The opportunity for early treatment can be hampered by a failure to convince pediatricians that the majority of misshapen newborn ears do not self-correct,"" Dr. Byrd and coauthors write. They also point out that EarWell is highly successful in the treatment of prominent ears--a condition that commonly goes unnoticed by parents and pediatricians, but is likely to get worse as the child grows.\n\n""While we can operate on ears later in the patient\'s life, waiting not only increases the surgery\'s difficulty and expense, but may expose the child to teasing, bullying, and loss of self-esteem,"" comments Editor-in-Chief Rod J. Rohrich, MD, in a featured video on the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery website. ""If your baby has any type of ear deformity, plastic surgeons can help with or without surgery.

The news release focuses on a recent journal article that evaluates the use of a nonsurgical treatment called the “EarWell system” to treat malformations of the ear in newborn infants. The news release reports that results were judged “good to excellent” for most patients in the retrospective study. However, the release poses some significant problems for readers. For example, the release doesn’t discuss cost and does not tell readers that the study co-author quoted extensively is the inventor of the EarWell system. The release also treats ear deformation and ear malformation interchangeably — a distinction made clearly in the relevant journal article. This is particularly important because the numbers discussed in the news release sometimes refer to patients with deformities and sometimes to patients with malformation.

Chronic inflammation is known to contribute to the development and progression of several diseases, including some cancers.\n\nResults of the randomized, controlled clinical trial -- which involved more than 200 overweight, postmenopausal women who had insufficient levels of vitamin D at the beginning of the study -- are published online ahead of the July print issue of Cancer Prevention Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\n""We know from our previous studies that by losing weight, people can reduce their overall levels of inflammation, and there is some evidence suggesting that taking vitamin D supplements can have a similar effect if one has insufficient levels of the nutrient,"" said lead and corresponding author Catherine Duggan, Ph.D., a principal staff scientist in the Public Health Sciences Division at Fred Hutch. However, it has not been known whether combining the two -- weight loss and vitamin D -- would further boost this effect. ""It\'s the first study to test whether adding vitamin D augments the considerable effect of weight loss on inflammatory biomarkers,"" she said.\n\nTo explore this question, Duggan and colleagues recruited 218 healthy, overweight older women who had lower-than-recommended levels of vitamin D (less than 32 ng/mL). The women then took part in a 12-month diet and exercise program (including 45 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise five days a week). Half of the study participants were randomly selected to receive 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily for the duration of the year-long trial, and the other half received an identical-appearing placebo, or dummy vitamin. Biomarkers of inflammation were measured at the beginning and end of the study. The researchers then compared changes in these levels between the two groups.\n\nAt the end of the study, all of the participants had reduced levels of inflammation, regardless of whether they took vitamin D, ""which highlights the importance of weight loss in reducing inflammation,"" Duggan said. However, those who saw the most significant decline in markers of inflammation were those who took vitamin D and lost 5 to 10 percent of their baseline weight. These study participants had a 37 percent reduction in a pro-inflammatory cytokine called interleukin-6, or IL-6, as compared to those in the placebo group, who saw a 17.2 percent reduction in IL-6. The researchers found similar results among women in the vitamin D group who lost more than 10 percent of their starting weight. While IL-6 has normal functions in the body, elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of developing certain cancers and diabetes and may be implicated as a cause of depression, Duggan said.\n\n""We were quite surprised to see that vitamin D had an effect on an inflammation biomarker only among women who lost at least 5 percent of their baseline weight,"" Duggan said. ""That suggests vitamin D can augment the effect of weight loss on inflammation.""\n\nVitamin D is a steroid hormone that has multiple functions beyond its widely recognized role in regulating calcium levels and bone metabolism. Vitamin D receptors are found in more than 30 cell types and the research focus around this nutrient recently has shifted from bone health to vitamin D\'s effect on cancer, cardiovascular health and weight loss, among other health issues.\n\nInflammation occurs when the body is exposed to pathogens, such as bacteria or viruses, which puts the immune system in overdrive until the ""attack"" ceases and the inflammatory response abates. Overweight or obese people, however, exist in a state of chronic inflammation. This sustained upregulation of the inflammatory response occurs because fat tissue continually produces cytokines, molecules that are usually only present for a short time, while the body is fighting infection, for example.\n\n""It is thought that this state of chronic inflammation is pro-tumorigenic, that is, it encourages the growth of cancer cells,"" she said. There is also some evidence that increased body mass ""dilutes"" vitamin D, possibly by sequestering it in fat tissue.\n\n""Weight loss reduces inflammation, and thus represents another mechanism for reducing cancer risk,"" Duggan said. ""If ensuring that vitamin D levels are replete, or at an optimum level, can decrease inflammation over and above that of weight loss alone, that can be an important addition to the tools people can use to reduce their cancer risk.""\n\nDuggan encourages women to speak to their health care providers about measuring their levels of vitamin D to determine the most appropriate dosage.\n\n###\n\nThe Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Susan G.

The study, published in Cancer Prevention Research, has potential relevance for cancer prevention because inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the genesis and progression of some cancers, as well as heart disease and other disorders. The release offers substantial details about the design, metrics and outcomes of the clinical trial and does a pretty good job of defining the possible reasons for the effects of chronic inflammation and weight loss on cancer development. It goes to some lengths to narrowly define the results and avoid overstatement. That said, the release ends on a sour note by encouraging readers to talk to their doctors about vitamin D testing — a recommendation not consistent with U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and which is not supported by this research. Readers might also have been better informed if the release had offered more context regarding the many conflicting and sometimes confusing studies that have previously looked for links among vitamin D, inflammatory responses, diet, overweight, sun exposure and cancer.

The disease kills about 40 percent who are diagnosed, reflecting the fact that most people do not undergo colonoscopy until they have symptoms such as bleeding - at which point the cancer may be advanced.\n\nIf forthcoming studies prove successful, the test could increase early detection by making screening less onerous.\n\nNow, the gold standard for screening is a colonoscopy, which requires a colon clean-out only slightly less unpleasant than stomach flu, followed by threading a scope through the intestines under anesthesia.\n\n""The fact of the matter is, very few people avail themselves of [screening] colonoscopy - only about 20 percent,"" Johns Hopkins University researcher Bert Vogelstein said. ""So there is a real need for a noninvasive test.""\n\nVogelstein discovered genetic defects that turn precancerous polyps into malignant tumors. He is not involved in Exact Science\'s research, but the company licensed some of his technology from Hopkins for the test.\n\nColonoscopy would still be the only way to confirm a positive result from the new test and remove suspicious polyps.\n\nBut most people using the new test would have negative results. And even if a result was wrong, colon cancers tend to grow slowly, so Exact Sciences estimates the test would be needed only every three years.\n\nWhile taking a wait-and-see attitude, Vogelstein said the science behind the new test looked promising.\n\n""I haven\'t looked under the hood, but it sounds like they\'re getting close,"" Vogelstein said. ""It\'s not as sensitive as colonoscopy, but if it holds up in a larger study, it would be a respectable way to screen.""\n\nThere are currently two stool screening tests; one uses Vogelstein\'s mutation discoveries, and the other searches for blood hidden in the stool. Both miss many cancers.\n\nExact Sciences\' test combines mutations and hidden blood with a novel molecular marker called methylation, in which cells use a chemical tag to turn off certain genes.\n\nWhen cells turn cancerous, methylation goes awry in ways that can be measured.\n\nIn the latest study, the new test was able to detect polyps bigger than a quarter-inch, while ignoring smaller, usually inconsequential ones. And though it picked up an average of 85 percent of tumors in the most curable stages, it detected only 69 percent of late-stage cancer, suggesting that methylation changes as cancer spreads beyond the colon.\n\nHowever, the latest results were based on testing 678 stool samples from patients with and without cancer who had already undergone conventional screening and diagnosis. The next study, planned for next year and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, will see how the DNA test performs in real-life use, Ahlquist said.\n\nThough the cost has not been set, it could be as low as $300 per test.\n\n""It will be affordable and very cost-effective,"" he said.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina researcher David Ransohoff, who has worked with Exact Sciences both as a paid and unpaid adviser, has seen other promising screening tests turn into disappointments.\n\n""These results should be confirmed in other appropriate populations,"" he said.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story starts with an overly optimistic lead and never does follow up with adequate discussion of the limitations of this preliminary research. And why use the tired old “Holy Grail appears to be getting close” line? (Not the only story to do so.)<br/>
</span>","The story suffers from a lack of independent voices and a lack of clear analysis of the data. There was little more than a nod to the potential harms done in over-screening. Detection of a marker for a disease is not the same as preventing a disease or preventing a death.

A new study finds hormone fluctuations that occur over the course of a woman\'s menstrual cycle may impact her ability to kick the cigarette habit.\n\nAccording to small study conducted by researchers at the University of Montreal, women are more likely to crave cigarettes and have trouble quitting when in the follicular phase of their monthly cycle. This is the time right after her period and before ovulation.\n\n""While overall more men than women smoke cigarettes, women and girls take less time to become dependent after initial use and have more difficulties quitting the habit,"" the researchers write in their study. ""One of the factors contributing to these differences may be that women crave cigarettes more than men and that their desire to smoke is influenced by hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle.""\n\nThe study, which was published in Psychiatry Journal, involved 19 women and 15 men who were all chronic smokers but otherwise healthy. None of the study participants were enrolled in a smoking cessation program or were trying to quit.\n\nResearchers asked each participant to smoke one cigarette 30 to 40 minutes before undergoing an fMRI, or brain scan. They were asked to view photos both related and unrelated to smoking. After undergoing the brain scans they viewed the photos a second time and reported on a scale from zero to 100 if the pictures triggered cigarette cravings.\n\nThe researchers tested 13 of the female participants twice to assess how their response changed at a different point in their menstrual cycle.\n\nThe brain scans showed that during the follicular stage, cigarette imagery activated five areas of the brain which the researchers say are linked to higher-level cravings. However during the luteal phase -- after a woman ovulates and before her period -- only one area of the brain was activated by images of cigarettes and smoking.\n\nDuring the luteal phase, estrogen and progesterone levels are at their highest, which may help a woman keep addictive cravings at bay and reduce feelings of cigarette withdrawal.\n\nPrevious studies have found women\'s monthly hormone fluctuations can affect everything from food cravings and digestive problems to joint pain and a whole host of other health issues.\n\n""This result emphasizes the need for gender-specific programs to quit smoking, as well as taking into consideration a menstrual cycle phase during addiction treatment in women,"" the researchers conclude. They called for more studies to help understand all the factors that contribute to sex and gender differences in smoking.']", ,"The story’s headline and lead paragraph promise news about the best time of the month for women to quit smoking. But the study being reported on can tell us almost nothing about that intriguing topic. The study involved just 13 female smokers who were looking at smoking-related images, and the researchers found that brain scans differed between women who were at different phases in the menstrual cycle when they viewed the images. These subjects weren’t trying to quit smoking, and there’s no way to know, based on this research, whether the menstrual cycle plays any role in the success of attempts to quit. So the main gist of this story is irresponsible speculation.

We currently have to rely on liver biopsy to measure fibrosis at its early stages - by examining a piece of the liver under the microscope.\n\n""We know that the presence of even mild fibrosis of the liver predicts a worse long-term outcome for patients with NAFLD and so it\'s important to be able to detect liver scarring at an early stage.""\n\nProviding a scale of damage\n\nIn this first stage of research the team developed the blood analysis in 26 patients with NAFLD. The test detects chemical changes on tiny amounts of ""cell-free"" DNA that are released into the blood when liver cells are injured. Changes in DNA methylation at genes like PPARγ that controls scar formation are then used to stratify patients by fibrosis severity.\n\nSenior author Dr Jelena Mann of Newcastle University\'s Institute for Cellular Medicine added: ""This is the first time that a DNA methylation \'signature\' from the blood has been shown to match the severity of a liver disease.\n\n""It opens up the possibility of an improved blood test for liver fibrosis in the future.""\n\nDr Timothy Hardy is a hepatology registrar within Newcastle Hospitals and a Medical Research Council-funded clinical research training fellow at the University. He conducted the research as part of his PhD project and said: ""We are now working on confirming these findings in a larger group of patients.\n\n""If we are able to accurately tell the extent of a person\'s liver damage with a blood test, and even track the scarring as it gets better or worse, it could provide reassurance for patients, save NHS resources and avoid patients having to undergo a liver biopsy.""\n\nThis research is part of Newcastle University\'s response to the challenges and opportunities presented by an ageing population. Newcastle University is a world leader in the field at its Campus for Ageing and Vitality, the location for a new £40m National Centre for Ageing Science and Innovation (NASI).

Steatosis (""fatty liver"") - a build-up of fat in the liver cells that is often picked up as an incidental finding during tests carried out for another reason\n\n2. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population\n\n3. Fibrosis - where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue to form in the liver, but the liver is still able to function normally\n\n4. Cirrhosis - the most severe stage, occurring after years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can lead to liver failure (where the liver stops working properly) and liver cancer\n\nIt can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop and the presence of this scarring predicts those people with the worse prognosis. It\'s important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the disease from getting worse.\n\n(INFORMATION MODIFIED FROM NHS CHOICES, WITH UPDATES BASED ON CURRENT EVIDENCE)']",There’s missing context in this release that might leave readers confused about the actual low risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease progressing to more serious conditions such as cirrhosis and liver failure. The release is perhaps more optimistic about the test than is warranted from these early results.,"The release is an overview of a recent journal article that reports findings on a new blood test that detects liver fibrosis — or scarring of the liver — based on differences in “DNA methylation.” The release says the new technique can also detect the severity of the fibrosis in patients. The release does not, however, discuss cost, potential harms (such as the possibility of misdiagnosis), how this technique may be better than other early diagnostic techniques (such as using magnetic resonance enterography [MRE]), or adequately discuss the limitations of the study. It also engages in some fear-mongering and unjustifiable language.

Patients receiving the texts also were more likely to be active and to quit smoking than the patients in the control group, who didn't receive such texts.\n\nRepeat heart attacks make up more than a quarter of all heart attacks in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of these attacks could be prevented by lifestyle changes. But while health systems have gotten very good at treating heart attacks, they struggle to connect with patients recovering from heart attacks after they return home.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of a heart attack, “doctors dump a lot of information onto patients in a few days,” says Clara Chow, leader of the study, who is director of the cardiovascular division at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney and an associate professor at the University of Sydney Medical School. But after the initial flurry, Dr. Chow says, there is often little follow-up to make sure the patients follow through on recommended practices. “Texts allow us to give support in bite-size chunks,” she says.\n\nThe six-month study in Australia included about 700 patients with coronary heart disease. Half of the patients received four text messages a week generated by a computer algorithm designed to be encouraging and give helpful advice, such as: “Have you gone for your walk today, Jane?” Or “did you know 90% of people don’t eat the recommended daily intake of vegetables (5 servings a day)?” The other half of the patients received no such texts.\n\nAfter six months, the difference in blood pressure between the two groups was similar to what would have been achieved using a standard blood-pressure-lowering tablet, says Dr. Chow. She says that the differences in body fat and physical activity were also large—“comparable or greater than [would have been expected if the patients had been] attending a cardiac-rehabilitation program.” The effect on cholesterol level was smaller, less than 20% of what could have been expected if comparing a statin with a placebo, she says.\n\nWhile many previous studies have looked at the effect of text messaging on certain behaviors, this study stands out, doctors say, because it used objective measures, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, rather than relying entirely on self-reported metrics, which could be biased.\n\nEarlier studies also were often conducted on a smaller scale and over a shorter time—three months or less, says Shivan Mehta, associate chief innovation officer at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. The length of the Australian study was important, Dr. Mehta says, because the first six months after a heart attack are a high-risk period during which new health habits are formed. Another advance, he says, is that the Australian study targeted multiple risk factors concurrently—smoking, exercise, diet and general cardiovascular awareness, rather than focusing on a single behavior.\n\nDr. Chow is now attempting to replicate her results with a new study over a longer period and using a larger sample size. The new study will be run from more than 15 locations for 12 months and involve 1,400 patients. And unlike the earlier study, in which patients didn’t have the opportunity to text back, this study will encourage participants to send questions to a health counselor. There will also be more focus on encouraging patients to continue taking prescribed medication.\n\nExperts hope that targeted text messages can also help patients with other severe and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, chronic lung disease and even mental-health illnesses, when patients require continuing support and lifestyle modifications. Texting also may be helpful in countries where patients don’t have easy access to medical support.\n\nMs. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J. Email her at reports@wsj.com.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nClara Chow is director of the cardiovascular division at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney, as well as an associate professor at the University of Sydney Medical School. An earlier version of this article omitted Dr. Chow’s position at the George Institute, which is her primary affiliation. (June 30, 2016)""]","The story serves up an important reminder that we can’t say something “prevents a heart attack” for research of this nature, where rates of heart attacks weren’t actually measured. Instead, surrogate markers, such as lipid levels, were used.","This is a story about a now year-old study looking at whether a program of semi-personalized mobile phone text messages supporting healthy lifestyle choices led to significant differences in cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, and BMI in a group of patients with known coronary heart disease, compared to those who did not receive such messages.
The story makes those differences clear in an accessible chart. What is less clear is whether these differences are due to beneficial changes caused by the text messages or other factors. For example, in a subsequent letter to the journal, a researcher notes that the differences in blood pressure between the two groups were due mainly to 7-point increase in the control group, whereas the text message group’s blood pressure stayed about the same over the course of the study. Similarly, the BMI differences between the groups were due partly to an increase in BMI in the control group and weren’t entirely due to reductions in the text message group. The story communicates the study results accurately and doesn’t suggest that the text messages lowered CVD risk factors from baseline. Without a more specific explanation, however, many readers may assume that’s what happened.
Another cautionary note is that the headline goes beyond the findings, suggesting that text messages can possibly “prevent” heart attacks. The study offers no evidence for that link: There was no measurement of heart attack rates between groups. Instead, they measured several surrogate markers associated with heart disease, such as lipid levels and blood pressure.

This is less than half of what people consume now.\n\nOne reason for this advice: Elevated blood pressure is a major public health problem approximately 90% of all Americans will develop hypertension over their lifetime, the heart association says.\n\nBut a new European population study coordinated in Belgium raises questions about sodium and its effect on the heart.\n\nResearchers followed 3,681 people, average age 40, for about eight years, testing sodium excretion in the urine. They found that systolic blood pressure (the top number) was slightly lower in those who excreted less sodium, but this didn\'t translate into a lower risk of cardiovascular death — in fact, those with lower sodium excretion had an increased risk of cardiovascular death. The findings were consistent in participants younger and older than 60 years.\n\nJan Staessen, a professor of medicine at the University of Leuven in Belgium and one of the authors of the study in Wednesday\'s Journal of the American Medical Association, says this study does not support the recommendation of a general reduction of salt intake for everyone, although salt reduction could be beneficial in lowering the blood pressure of people with hypertension. ""Lower sodium intake is recommended for people with high blood pressure and people with heart failure, but recommending it to the population as a whole, I wouldn\'t do without proving it\'s completely safe,"" he says.\n\n""If one lowers sodium intake to lower blood pressure, this change in sodium activates several systems (including the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) that conserve sodium, and those systems are implicated in disease processes such as damaging the arterial wall and kidneys,"" Staessen says,\n\nThis study may apply to Americans of white European descent, but it might less applicable to blacks because they are believed to be more salt sensitive, he says.\n\nThe research is already drawing fire from medical experts here. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association and chairman of neurology at the University of Miami, says this is only one study of a relatively young, mostly white population and blood pressure tends to rise with age and affect African-Americans disproportionately.\n\n""We have based our recommendations on the many scientific studies which show a strong relationship between reduced sodium consumption and a lower risk of heart attacks, congestive heart failure and stroke,"" he says. ""There are good randomized, controlled studies the gold standard of scientific studies that show a lower sodium diet has a meaningful effect on blood pressure.""\n\nGina Lundberg, a preventive cardiologist in Atlanta, supports the 1,500-milligram guideline. ""We\'re all eating too much sodium because we eat too many prepared, processed foods.""\n\nLeaders in the salt industry applaud the new research.

Although there is ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaginal laser surgery, a new study suggests that it may be effective, especially after multiple treatments. Study results are published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCollectively known as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), the various genital and urinary problems associated with menopause have created a market for new therapies and treatments to help women regain sexual function and bladder control. Vaginal laser surgery represents one of the newer and more hotly contested approaches.\n\nIn the case of microablative fractional CO2 laser surgery, a series of microscopic laser beams using fractionated energy penetrate the skin to remove old and damaged skin cells, intended to rebuild the vaginal pathway. In this new study, GSM symptoms were evaluated up to12 months after the last laser surgery and compared based on the number of total therapies applied (up to a total of five).\n\nThe results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. It further demonstrated that four or five laser therapies may be superior in lowering the intensity of GSM symptoms compared with three laser therapies in both short- and long-term follow-up. Study results are published in the article ""Microablative fractional CO2 laser for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: up to 12-month results.""\n\n""This study adds to the literature on vaginal laser therapy for GSM. However, more robust randomized, sham-controlled data are needed, with larger numbers of women, to evaluate long-term safety, benefits, and risks,"" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, NAMS executive director. ""Until more data are available, all treatment options, including lubricants, vaginal moisturizers, and FDA-approved vaginal and systemic hormone therapies, should be discussed with women who suffer from GSM to determine the best treatment option for them.""\n\n###\n\nFor more information about menopause and healthy aging, visit http://www. menopause. org .']",The release fails to mention that the FDA has issued a warning against the use of vaginal laser surgery for menopausal symptoms.,"This news release summarizes an observational study on the benefits of CO2 ablative laser treatments for reducing menopausal symptoms like vaginal dryness/itching/burning, painful intercourse, frequent urinating, or incontinence in 94 post-menopausal women. While the release makes the claim that the study “demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness,” it was an observational study which cannot show cause-and-effect.
The release notes that this intervention is a subject of debate among experts, and that more studies are needed to confirm the long term efficacy and safety of this approach.
It falls short in several areas: it neglects to mention that the FDA warns against using lasers for menopause symptoms, excludes any data from the study, and omits disclosure of significant financial conflicts of interest among study authors and the organization that distributed the release, the North American Menopause Society.

In men, T plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass and growth of body hair. In addition, T is essential for overall health and well-being and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of circulating T in men, contributes to frailty and bone loss.\n\nIn the absence of large, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials of longer duration, substantial evidence regarding the safety and risk of testosterone therapy (TTh) with regard to cardiovascular outcomes can only be gleaned from observational studies. To date, there are limited studies comparing the effects of long-term TTh in hypogonadal men who were treated or remained untreated with T.\n\nResearchers at Boston University Schools of Medicine (BUSM) and Public Health (BUSPH), along with researchers in Germany, established a registry to assess long-term effectiveness and safety of T in men. For this study, they sought to compare its effects on a host of parameters (obesity, cholesterol levels, diabetes, liver function) considered to contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe researchers followed a group of men for eight years who had been on TTh and compared them with another group of men who remained untreated for the same time period. They found there were only two deaths in the TTh group and neither was related to CV events. In the non-treated control group, there were 21 deaths, 19 of which were related to CV events. Furthermore, there were 26 non-fatal myocardial infarctions and 30 non-fatal strokes in the control group but none in the T-treated group.\n\nAccording to the researchers, long-term TTh in men with hypogonadism appears to be an effective approach to achieve sustained improvements in cardiometabolic function and reduces the risk of CV events. ""The low CV events observed in the T-group compared to the untreated (control) group strongly suggest that TTh is protective. We believe that the protective effect of T on the CV system provides clinicians with the opportunity to utilize this approach for secondary prevention for hypogonadal men with a history of CV events,"" explained corresponding author Abdulmaged M. Traish, PhD, professor of biochemistry and urology at BUSM.\n\n###\n\nConflict of interest disclosure statement:\n\nContributing authors Dr. Farid Saad is a full time employee of Bayer Pharma.\n\nDr. Ahmad Haider has received partial compensation for data entry from Bayer Pharma.\n\nDr. Gheorghe Doros has received payment for statistical analysis from Bayer Pharma.']",This release on an observational study of men taking testosterone therapy compared with those who did not fails to bring clarity to the testosterone replacement therapy research landscape.,"This news release summarizes an observational study that compared the records of older men with low testosterone levels and who receive testosterone therapy with those who have chosen to take a pass on such treatment. The study observed that over a period of 8 years, those in the therapy category experienced significantly fewer strokes and deaths related to cardiovascular disease than did those who weren’t on testosterone therapy.
The release does a good job of reminding readers that this study design is not as robust as a randomized clinical trial, but it does claim that the findings lend clarity to an otherwise murky landscape in which the impact of hormone-replacement therapy remains uncertain. It also offers transparency in the form of a list of financial ties three researchers have with Bayer Pharma, but unfortunately the release neglects to go one step further and mention that Bayer, which also markets hormone replacement drugs, funded the study.

It also continues with its research on new therapies for ophthalmological and inflammatory illnesses.\n\nIt must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III ""Helix"" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.\n\n###\n\nAbout RNA interference: https:/ / www. youtube. com/ watch?v= iXvSitR5184\n\nAbout tivanisiran (SYL1001)\n\nTivanisiran is a drug based on RNAi that is administered as preservative-free eye drops; it selectively inhibits production of the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV1). These receptors are ion channels that mediate the transmission of ocular pain. Tivanisiran is a small synthetic double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide (siRNA) with a novel and highly selective mechanism of action. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3.\n\nTivanisiran is a product under development for the treatment of signs and symptoms related to dry eye syndrome and has the potential to be developed for other pathologies that cause ocular pain (corneal lesions, refractive surgery, etc.) , , .\n\nAbout RNA interference (RNAi)\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process that regulates the expression of certain genes, providing a role in innate defense and development in animals and plants. This process is used to specifically silence genetic transcripts that encode protein-causing diseases. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects. This new approach to drug discovery is a promising technology that is rapidly moving in the translational research space , .\n\nAbout dry eye syndrome\n\nDry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that produces symptoms of ocular discomfort, eyesight disorders, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome is accompanied by such symptoms as ocular pain, itching, stinging, and irritation of the eye tissues. It is a characteristic disease of developed countries, associated with pollution, air conditioning, the use of contact lenses, refractive surgery and continued use of computers. Moreover, the amount and quality of tears decrease with age. Prevalence is between 10% and 20% among people aged 50 or over, and it is more frequent in womeni,ii.\n\nDry eye can be treated with cyclosporin drops or autologous serum, but there is as yet no specific product for chronic treatment of the ocular pain related to dry eye syndrome; oral analgesics or anaesthetics are used in general. However, the main treatment consists of artificial tears, in the form of drops, gel or creams. Preservative-free eye drops have generally been found to offer the best long-term response.\n\nAbout Sylentis']","There’s no information offered on cost, benefits, harms or any description of the study, including number of patients enrolled.","This news release focuses on a study of a new drug, tivanisiran, to treat dry eyes that was presented at a recent medical conference. It mentions the completion of both phase I and phase 2 trials and the start of a phase 3 trial, but it neglects to provide any of the details of the research. There is nothing offered about costs, the benefits or the harms of using the drug. It refers to the terms of “dry eye disease” or “dry eyes syndrome” repeatedly even though these are not recognized medical conditions.

(Table sugar, or sucrose, extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets, is a compound of glucose and fructose.) Researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose, fructose and insulin, and of leptin and ghrelin, enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness.\n\nBefore having their drinks, the participants rated their desire to eat on a one-to-10 scale from “not at all” to “very much.” Then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets. As they did so, they rated their hunger using the scale. The volunteers were then presented with images of high-calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now, or a monetary award a month later instead.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PNAS, found that compared with glucose, consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, a region that plays an important role in reward processing. The fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food, a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose.\n\nWhen choosing between tasty high-calorie food or a delayed monetary reward, fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food.\n\nThere was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers. But plasma insulin response was sharply lower in fructose drinkers, which may affect what we eat, according to the senior author, Dr. Kathleen A. Page, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.\n\n“Insulin is released when we consume glucose,” she said. “The pancreas secretes insulin, and insulin drives glucose into cells so that it can be used for energy. But it also sends a signal to the brain that says ‘you’ve eaten.’ Fructose doesn’t stimulate insulin secretion, and if there’s no insulin, you don’t get the information that you’re full.”\n\nDoes this mean that it is a good idea to avoid fruit, because it contains fructose?\n\n“No,” Dr. Page said. “Don’t stop eating fruit. It has a relatively low amount of sugar compared with processed foods and soft drinks — maybe 5 grams in an orange, compared with 25 grams in a 12-ounce can of soda. And it is packed with fiber, which helps slow down the absorption of food, which makes you feel full.”\n\n\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, “like” our Facebook page.']",This report about a small but interesting study on fructose lacks the context that would have helped readers make better health decisions.,"The story reports that a study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found that people who consume fructose were more likely to crave high-calorie foods than people who consumed glucose. The conclusion of the story is that the type of sugar one consumes can influence one’s food cravings. The story does a pretty good job of describing the mechanics of the research and what the investigators found. But the story did not place the work in context by discussing other research on neuroscience and sugar consumption. And the key shortcoming in the story is that it does not address a core issue — how people might (or might not) be able to take action on such findings.

It significantly raises the risk of stroke.\n\nPatients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure — which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates — was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study’s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure.\n\nDubbed Stop-af, the Medtronic trial showed that almost 70 percent of patients who had cryoablation remained free of the condition after one year, compared with just 7 percent of patients who received drug therapy, according to data presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta.\n\n“This is the best data we have at this point in support of cryoablation (to treat atrial fibrillation),” said Dr. Douglas Packer of Mayo Clinic, the lead investigator of the study.\n\nOver 3 percent of patients treated by cryoablation experienced a serious condition — a narrowing of the pulmonary vein in 7 out of 228 patients, one of whom required another procedure to widen the vein.\n\nDamage or irritation to the nerve that controls the diaphragm was reported in 11 percent of the cryoablation procedures, but none of the cases was considered serious, with 98 percent resolved by the 12-month follow-up.\n\nComplications related to the atrial fibrillation itself were also monitored. During the follow-up period, 97 percent of patients who got the procedure and 92 percent of the drug therapy patients did not suffer heart attack, stroke or death.\n\nLess than 1 percent of patients treated with cryoablation were hospitalized for a recurrence of the disease, compared with 6 percent in the drug group.\n\nPatients in the pilot study had advanced atrial fibrillation and tended to have other medical problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or coronary artery disease,\n\nPacker, who also led the pilot study, dubbed Cabana, acknowledged that the main limitation of this study was its small size, but said it lays the foundation for a larger one.\n\nHe said the larger study, which will include 180 centers, is currently enrolling patients.\n\nAnti-arrhythmic drugs eliminate atrial fibrillation in about half of all patients but can have adverse side effects.\n\nCryoablation is an alternative that is growing in popularity. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective.\n\nCatheter ablation involves inserting a thin tube into a blood vessel, usually through a site in the upper leg or neck, and then threading it though the body until it reaches the heart. When it reaches the area of the heart that causes abnormal rhythms, the tissue is ablated, or destroyed.\n\nThe procedure has been used to treat arrhythmias for years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration initially cleared ablation catheters to treat arrhythmias, such as atrial flutter, but not atrial fibrillation.\n\nOnly Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has an ablation device approved by U.S. health regulators specifically to treat atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe Medtronic device, which the company added to its portfolio with the 2008 acquisition of CryoCath, has been approved in Europe and Australia.\n\nMedtronic shares were up 3.7 percent to $45.55 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.']","Overall, this was a balanced report but we wish it had included independent perspectives – maybe even someone who could compare this device with another already on the market.","This story reports on results from a preliminary study for a device in development to treat atrial fibrillation.  Although it appears to be intended as a business story, we think shareholders would care about cost and comparisons with existing alternatives as much as patients and consumers should care about these.

But you can also tell by the ads: TV spots selling remedies for drippy, congested noses, itchy eyes and other symptoms are in heavy rotation.\n\nNew this year: ads for Flonase, a nasal steroid spray from GlaxoSmithKline that just became available over the counter. It joins Sanofi\'s Nasacort, a spray in the same class that went from prescription to over-the-counter status a year ago. And they both sit on store shelves next to antihistamines such as Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec that were prescription drugs just a few years ago. Older over-the-counter antihistamines, such as Benadryl, and decongestants, such as Sudafed and Afrin, remain available as well.\n\nDon\'t expect the ads to help you sort out what might work best for you. Here\'s what some top allergists say you need to know about these non-prescription options.\n\nBelieve (some of) the hype about the newly-accessible steroid nasal sprays.\n\nThese drugs work by fighting inflammation and they are in the ""single most effective drug class"" for treating nasal allergies, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Other expert groups have made similar statements. ""These are first-line treatments"" that can prevent allergy symptoms, not just treat them, says Jackie Eghrari-Sabet, an allergist in Gaithersburg, Md.\n\nBut that does not mean they work for everyone, says James Sublett, a Louisville allergist and president of the allergy group. People with mild to moderate symptoms have the best chance of full relief, he says.\n\nPossible side effects include nasal irritation and nose bleeds. Labels caution that some children using the sprays may experience slower growth, so a doctor should be consulted if a child needs them for more than two months.\n\nExpect to pay more.\n\nWhen prescription drugs are first available over the counter, most consumers end up paying more, because their insurers no longer cover the cost. The non-prescription steroid nasal sprays are selling for about $17 to $23 for a one-month supply (at the typical two-squirts per nostril adult starting dose). Worth knowing: so far, insurers have continued to pay for similar prescription sprays, Eghrari-Sabet says. The various sprays have never been studied head to head, so it\'s impossible to say whether they vary in effectiveness, she says.\n\nThere\'s a right way to use these sprays.\n\nThey should be used daily during your vulnerable season or seasons, ideally starting before symptoms do, Eghrari-Sabet says. The idea is ""to turn an army of inflammatory cells around before they recruit more soldiers,"" she says.\n\nIt\'s also important to administer the sprays correctly, so that they end up inside your nasal passages, not just your nose, where they might cause irritation, Sublett says. Packages contain instructions, and Sublett has an added tip: bend over and look at your toes while holding the bottle up and squirting.\n\nAntihistamines still have a role.\n\nThese drugs target histamine. That\'s a chemical your body releases, causing sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes, when you come in contact with allergy-triggering substances. Antihistamines work faster than the steroid sprays, which can take a week or so to reach full effectiveness. They also can be cheaper, because they are available in store-brand versions. For example, Walmart sells Equate loratadine tablets (the same active ingredient as Claritin) for about $7 for 60 24-hour doses\n\nAntihistamines make perfect sense for someone who suffers a few sneezy days each season and doesn\'t want to use a spray for weeks or months, Eghrari-Sabet says. Look for one that does not make you sleepy, Sublett says. It\'s a myth, he adds, that older, sedating antihistamines, such as Benadryl, are extra effective against nasal allergies.\n\nBe careful with decongestants.\n\nDecongestants such as Sudafed work by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nose. They can raise blood pressure and cause jitters, and some people are more susceptible than others. Some decongestant sprays such as Afrin — unlike the steroid nasal sprays — can be used for just few days at a time, because they otherwise cause rebound symptoms.\n\nSo use these medications sparingly, Sublett says.\n\nKeep your medical providers in the loop.\n\nOver-the-counter treatments should not take the place of professional care — especially if you have never been formally diagnosed with allergies, if you have additional medical problems or if your symptoms persist or worsen, Eghrari-Sabet and Sublett say. An allergist can test you to find out what\'s causing your symptoms and offer additional treatments. Those include allergy shots and, for a few patients who qualify, newer immunotherapy pills that desensitize people to grass and ragweed pollens.\n\nAlso important to remember: While medications can be helpful, the first rule of allergy control is to avoid the substances that make you sniffle and sneeze. If you are allergic to mold spores or to pollen from trees, grasses or ragweed, that means knowing when levels are high (by checking pollen.com or the National Allergy Bureau) and then taking steps such as these recommended by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and & Immunology:\n\n• Keep windows closed at home and in your car.\n\n• Use air conditioning if possible.\n\n• Try to stay indoors, and avoid mowing lawns or raking leaves.\n\n• If you need to be outside for a long period, wear a pollen mask.\n\n• After time outside, take a shower, shampoo your hair and change clothes.']","This USA Today story is easy-to-read and has many consumer-friendly details, but it missed the mark on a few important points.","We congratulate this story for its thorough and nuanced discussion of the costs of different allergy medications — a rarity in health news today. But if a story is going to call certain medications “the single most effective drug class for treating nasal allergies,” then we’d like to see that statement backed up with evidence and a quantification of the benefits. It’s also problematic for this story to rely on a source with extensive ties to pharmaceutical companies that make allergy drugs without alerting readers to these relationships. We’re glad that a second independent expert was consulted to help deliver an evaluation of the comparative benefits.

Among children taking cannabidiol, the decrease in the frequency of convulsive seizures -- which involve a loss of consciousness, stiffened muscles and jerking movements -- was 23 percentage points greater than the decrease in seizures among children taking a placebo.\n\nThe study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine.\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study.\n\n""After 3,800 years of cannabis use for epilepsy ... we finally have solid evidence,"" said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, lead author of the study and director of NYU Langone\'s Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. His own previous research indicates that cannabis was used as early as 1800 B.C. in Sumeria to treat epilepsy; neurologists of the Victorian period used Indian hemp, which is rich in cannabidiol, for the same purpose.\n\nDespite the generally positive results, most study participants reported side effects that included vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea and some liver issues.\n\n""CBD is an effective drug for this type of rare epilepsy but was not a panacea (or cure-all) for these children,"" Devinsky said.\n\nWhat is Dravet syndrome?\n\nA total of 120 patients with Dravet syndrome, ranging in age from nearly 2 to 18 years old, were randomly assigned to receive either an oral solution of cannabidiol or a placebo for a 14-week period.\n\n""Dravet syndrome is a severe childhood-onset epilepsy that causes multiple kinds of seizures, developmental delays, speech and language problems, behavioral issues and movement and balance problems,"" said Brandy Fureman, vice president of research and new therapies at the Epilepsy Foundation. She was not involved in the new study.\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder that disrupts electrical communication between neurons in the brain. Considered a spectrum disorder, different epilepsy syndromes are defined by clusters of symptoms or features and treated accordingly.\n\nExisting epilepsy medications usually don\'t work for patients with Dravet, so ""up to 20% of these children die from seizures before age 20 years,"" Devinsky explained.\n\nWithin the study, individual participants experienced convulsive seizures at a rate ranging from four per month, on average, to 1,717 per month.\n\nDuring the 14-week study, frequency of convulsive seizures decreased from an average of 12.4 to 5.9 per month in the cannabidiol group, compared with 14.9 to 14.1 in the placebo group. On average, the change in seizure frequency amounted to a 39% decrease for the cannabidiol group patients, compared with a roughly 13% decrease among the placebo group.\n\nFive percent of the children became entirely seizure-free during the 14-week study. Overall, parents in the cannabidiol group felt that they witnessed ""significantly greater"" positive changes in their children than parents in the placebo group.\n\nHowever, there was a downside. Most (93%) of the cannabidiol patients reported side effects, though three-quarters of the placebo group patients did as well. Nine out of 61 cannabidiol group patients dropped out of the study, eight of them because of side effects, compared with just three of the 59 placebo group patients.\n\n""Tiredness (somnolence or fatigue) was most common; others were decreased appetite, diarrhea and vomiting,"" Devinsky explained.\n\nBased on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States.\n\nWayne Hall, professor and director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland in Australia, also believes the findings are ""sufficiently encouraging"" to warrant further research of cannabidiol that focuses on ""related forms of epilepsy.""\n\n\'Critically important\' for the epilepsy community\n\n""No one study decides an issue; the sample size is still relatively small (because this is a rare syndrome and so hard to study large numbers of cases) and the duration of treatment so far has been relatively short,"" Hall, who was not involved in the research, wrote in an email.\n\nStill, Hall said the research, which carefully measured safety and efficacy for a ""substantial"" number of children, showed ""clear evidence of benefits in reducing seizure frequency and severity over the duration of the trial.""\n\n""glad to see"" data coming out. Porter is not one of the researchers behind this study, though she too has published papers on cannabidiol as a treatment for epilepsy. Dr. Brenda Porter, associate professor of neurology at Stanford School of Medicine, said she\'s""glad to see"" data coming out. Porter is not one of the researchers behind this study, though she too has published papers on cannabidiol as a treatment for epilepsy.\n\n""Interestingly, it looks similar to our other seizure medications in terms of efficacy and tolerability,"" Porter said. ""So, sadly, not a home run for most patients but another tool in our treatment regimen.""\n\nThe marijuana plant is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. Scientific researchers studying cannabidiol must meet federal security requirements and follow federal practices. Some scientists have said these federal requirements have slowed research supporting medicinal benefits of the plant.\n\nPorter believes the study may open the door to having ""more thoughtful discussions with our patients about the efficacy and the side effects"" of cannabidiol. ""Hopefully, the FDA will see this as a sign it should be moved off of Schedule I. If it stays on Schedule I, we will have trouble getting it to our patients when it does become available.""\n\nThe 1970 Controlled Substances Act classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug , meaning it has ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.""\n\nChanging the schedule of a drug falls to the Drug Enforcement Administration or the Department of Health and Human Services. An interested party, such as a drug company, may also petition for the process to begin. The Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Drug Abuse provide guidance to the DEA when reviewing scientific evidence on which to base a schedule change.\n\nDr. David Gloss, director of clinical neurophysiology at CAMC Health System in Charleston, West Virginia, believes the new study is ""very important"" because ""there\'s a lot of people using cannabidiol for all kinds of stuff."" Gloss co-authored a review of cannabinoids for the Cochrane Library , which publishes systematic reviews of medical research. He was not involved in the new research.\n\nHe noted that generating more evidence of effective use is ""a good thing.""\n\nAlready, there is existing "" medical evidence of efficacy for narrow neurologic conditions,"" said Gloss, who hopes that when enough evidence is available, the classification of cannabidiol as a Schedule I drug might be reconsidered and changed.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe University of Queensland\'s Hall believes that boundaries between medical use of cannabinoids and the recreational use of cannabis by adults should not be blurred. ""If future clinical trials confirm these promising results, then appropriate regulation will enable the drug to be safely used for medical purposes,"" he said.\n\nThe Epilepsy Foundation\'s Fureman said, ""before publication of this trial, much of the clinical evidence about CBD\'s effects on people\'s seizures was uncontrolled and anecdotal."" She added that the new study is ""critically important"" for the epilepsy community, which believes a CBD-based medical product would be a first-in-class therapeutic option.\n\nOn the need for more scientific research, all these experts agree.\n\nAs Devinsky said, ""natural substances are not necessarily safe and effective. They need to be evaluated rigorously.""']",The story would have been even stronger if it had discuss the potential costs of the treatment.,"Whenever we see a verb like “slashes” in a headline, our skepticism meter starts to buzz. In this case, the headline does not do the story justice. The story appropriately brings to light the current state of evidence around medical use of marijuana for treating epilepsy, restrictions on its use, the small size of this particular trial, and the high rate of adverse side effects. It makes great use of independent sources, too.  It’s unfortunate in our click-crazed media moment that so many people may read nothing more than this headline in a tweet and feel sufficiently informed.
Overall, we were impressed by the quality of this story and level of detail it included. The story would have been even stronger if it had discuss the potential costs of the treatment.

Thourani, MD, from Emory University in Atlanta, and colleagues from 12 other institutions in the United States found that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe and effective way to treat aortic stenosis in nonagenarians who qualify for the surgical technique.\n\n""Historically, extreme elderly patients can be at a very high risk for open surgery,"" said Dr. Thourani. ""We still believe that for those 90 year olds who are low-or intermediate risk, surgical options may be a viable procedure. However, with the advent of TAVR technology, we can now offer these extreme elderly patients a treatment option that otherwise would have been high-risk or prohibitive.""\n\nAortic stenosis is the most common acquired valve disease in elderly patients and affects nearly 3% of those over the age of 75, according to the American Heart Association. The ability to safely treat AS patients has become increasingly important; the US government predicts that the number of Americans over the age of 85 will exceed 11 million in the next 20 years.\n\nFor the study, the researchers used two different approaches: transfemoral TAVR (TF-TAVR), which is the traditional approach performed via the groin, and transapical TAVR (TA-TAVR), which is performed via the heart muscle. TA-TAVR is an alternative for patients who are medically ineligible for TF-TAVR secondary to severe peripheral vascular disease. While the current study did not evaluate other alternative options for TAVR, these techniques may include transaortic, transcaval, transcarotid, or trans-subclavian.\n\nIn the largest series published to date, between April 2007 and February 2012, 531 nonagenarians underwent TAVR: 329 with TF-TAVR and 202 with TA-TAVR.\n\n""We evaluated perioperative, short-, and mid-term outcomes following both TF- and TA-TAVR,"" explained Dr. Thourani. ""Compared with an age-sex-race-matched US population, the TAVR patients had a comparable risk of mortality, and quality of life improved within 6 months of the procedure. Our study shows that age alone should not preclude referral for TAVR in patients age 90 years and older.""\n\nThe study also showed that the 30-day stroke risk was 3.6% in TF-TAVR patients and 2.0% in TA-TAVR patients. Major complications, such as bleeding or vascular issues, occurred in 35% of TF-TAVR patients and 32% of TA-TAVR patients, and more than 80% of patients were discharged home after the procedure.\n\n""Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups,"" said Dr. Thourani, ""but I\'m thrilled that we\'re able to give elderly people the chance to continue enjoying life in their golden years. Many would not have had that option without TAVR.""\n\n###\n\nNotes for editors\n\nThourani V, Jensen H, Babaliaros V, Kodali S, Rajeswaran J, Ehrlinger J, Blackstone E, Suri R, Don C, Aldea G, Williams M, Makkar R, Svensson L, McCabe J, Dean L, Kapadia S, Cohen D, Pichard A, Szeto W, Herrmann H, Devireddy C, Leshnower B, Ailawadi G, Maniar H, Hahn R, Leon M, Mack M.

More specifically, the release describes TAVR surgeries as “safe” for “very elderly patients.” However, much hinges on how one defines “safe” — since the paper reports that more than 30 percent of patients suffered “major adverse events” within 30 days of having a TAVR procedure. In addition, some 13% of patients receiving one of the procedures likely died as a result of complications — context that would have been helpful for readers evaluating the study.

That post-stroke condition is known as neglect.\n\n“People that have that tend to do much worse in their eventual recovery,” Barrett said. “They’re less likely to become completely independent.”\n\nMost of those patients can improve with therapy and exercises, she said, but the process is often slow, and keeping people in the hospital during it is costly.\n\nShe said that because of that, the new findings are “promising,” but added that brain stimulation is still an experimental technique, and not ready to be used as part of normal stroke rehabilitation.\n\nFor the study, Italian researchers randomly assigned 20 patients with neglect to get real or fake magnetic stimulation in ten sessions over two weeks, in addition to their conventional rehab program. The treatment involved an electromagnetic coil placed over the left side of the brain that transmitted pulses of electrical currents.\n\nSimilar types of stimulation treatment are used in some patients with depression or during spinal surgery, according to Barrett. The device costs about $50,000.\n\nNine people in each group completed all the treatment sessions.\n\nBefore treatment, right after and another two weeks later, stroke patients were given tests to measure their visual-spatial skills, as well as attention and concentration. Those including drawing and shape-copying tests, as well as menu reading and map navigating tasks.\n\nPatients in both groups started out with an average mark of about 170 on the tests, which are scored from 0 to 227 combined.\n\nThe “real” magnetic stimulation group improved by about 16 percent right after the treatment and 23 percent at the later time point, while there was no significant benefit seen in patients given the fake stimulation.\n\nThe researchers said that it’s not clear what the amount of improvement they observed would mean for patients in their daily lives.\n\nBut, lead author Dr. Giacomo Koch said, “What we found is that the improvement was more marked in those patients that were more impaired.”\n\nKoch, from the Santa Lucia Foundation in Rome, told Reuters Health he thinks those patients with more severe problems would likely see a benefit outside of just test results.\n\nHe said that larger studies at multiple treatment sites are needed to determine how helpful magnetic stimulation can be in stroke recovery. But he was optimistic about the treatment’s future.\n\n“I think in a few years this could become another tool that could be used systematically in the neurorehabilitation wards,” Koch said. He added that the treatment isn’t painful, and only takes a few minutes for each session.\n\nClose to 800,000 people in the U.S. suffer a stroke each year, mostly older adults. For those with neglect, doctors typically prescribe cognitive rehabilitation, in which therapists teach skills and help the patient become more aware of the affected side of the body.\n\nBarrett, also from the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, said that she wonders whether stimulation could help patients achieve the goals that are most important to regaining independence after a stroke, such as using the bathroom.\n\nIt’s also not clear if the treatment might help most neglect patients, or if the findings only apply to certain groups, she told Reuters Health.\n\nThe ideal option might end up being a combination treatment that involves stimulation in certain patients and other therapies that address a range of skills important for regaining function, Barrett added. But, she said, “That all remains to be investigated.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/lUcacJ Neurology, online December 14, 2011.']","Thoroughly reported and engagingly written, this Reuters story about a new approach to stroke rehabilitation edged out the ","The major difference is that Reuters attempted to put the study’s main finding — a 23% improvement with the new treatment on a test of cognitive abilities — into meaningful terms for readers. And although WebMD quoted more sources (four independent experts compared with Reuters’ one), we think Reuters managed to cover most of the same ground and deliver the same cautious messages despite relying on fewer sources.

All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted.\n\nStem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body\'s tissues. In the past 15 years or so, scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure.\n\nHeart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. It often arises after a heart attack.\n\nSymptoms of heart failure include fatigue, breathlessness and swelling in the limbs. The condition cannot be cured, although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers used stem cells from the patients\' own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart.\n\nThat\'s in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients\' bone marrow -- into the heart.\n\nThe patch tactic could have some advantages, said senior researcher Dr. Yoshiki Sawa, of Osaka University.\n\nHe said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period, compared to injections.\n\nTo test the safety of the approach, Sawa\'s team recruited 27 patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies. The scientists extracted stem cells from each patient\'s thigh muscle, then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet.\n\nThe sheet was placed on each patient\'s heart.\n\nThe tactic appeared safe, the researchers said, and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year.\n\nWhy would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? It\'s not clear, Sawa acknowledged.\n\nThe stem cells don\'t grow into new heart muscle cells. Instead, Sawa explained, they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart. The theory, he said, is that ""hibernating"" cells in the heart muscle can then function better.\n\nStill, it\'s too soon to know what the new findings mean, said Gorodeski.\n\nThis type of trial, called phase 1, is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy, Gorodeski said. It takes later-phase trials -- where some patients receive the treatment, and others do not -- to prove that a therapy actually works.\n\nThose trials are underway, Sawa said.\n\nOther studies are further along. Last year, researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure.\n\nPatients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year, versus those given standard treatment only. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients\' heart function.\n\nSo it\'s not clear why the stem-cell patients fared better, Gorodeski said.\n\nFor now, he stressed, all stem-cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental.\n\n""There\'s no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now,"" Gorodeski said.\n\nThe message for patients, he added, is that heart failure can be treated, and researchers are looking for ""innovative"" ways to improve that treatment.\n\nThe study was published April 5 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on heart failure.']","The story could have dug a little deeper–heart surgery is not without risks, nor costs–but those points weren’t included.","This story about a small-scale study placing stem cell “patches” onto the heart included important limitations, such as the small study design and lack of a control group.

Now there\'s growing evidence that the same is true for your brain. A new study by researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago shows a diet plan they developed -- appropriately called the MIND diet -- may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer\'s disease by as much as 53 percent. Even those who didn\'t stick to the diet perfectly but followed it ""moderately well"" reduced their risk of Alzheimer\'s by about a third. Diet appears to be just one of ""many factors that play into who gets the disease,"" said nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, PhD, the lead author of the MIND diet study. Genetics and other factors like smoking, exercise and education also play a role. But the MIND diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against Alzheimer\'s regardless of other risk factors. The study, published in the journal Alzheimer\'s & Dementia, looked at more than 900 people between the ages of 58 and 98 who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing. It found participants whose diets most closely followed the MIND recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person 7.5 years younger. The MIND diet breaks its recommendations down into 10 ""brain healthy food groups"" a person should eat and five ""unhealthy food groups"" to avoid. It combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. (MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.) But the MIND diet also differs from those plans in a few significant ways and proved more effective than either of them at reducing the risk of Alzheimer\'s. Click through to see which foods to eat -- and which ones to avoid -- for optimal brain health.\n\nGreen leafy vegetables istockphoto The MIND diet recommends frequent servings of green leafy vegetables. Kale, spinach, broccoli, collards and other greens are packed with vitamins A and C and other nutrients. At least two servings a week can help, and researchers found six or more servings a week provide the greatest brain benefits. The Mediterranean and DASH diets do not specifically recommend these types of vegetables, but the MIND diet study found that including greens in addition to other veggies made a difference in reducing the risk of Alzheimer\'s.\n\nOther vegetables istockphoto Like other diets focused on weight loss and heart health, the MIND diet emphasizes the importance of vegetables for brain health. The researchers recommend eating a salad and at least one other vegetable every day to reduce the risk of Alzheimer\'s.\n\nNuts istockphoto Nuts are a good snack for brain health, according to the MIND diet study. Nuts contain healthy fats, fiber and antioxidants, and other studies have found they can help lower bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. The MIND diet recommends eating nuts at least five times a week.\n\nBerries istockphoto Berries are the only fruit specifically recommended in the MIND diet. ""Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,"" Morris said. She noted that strawberries have also shown benefits in past studies looking at the effect of food on cognitive function. The MIND diet recommends eating berries at least twice a week.\n\nBeans istockphoto If beans aren\'t a regular part of your diet, they should be. High in fiber and protein, and low in calories and fat, they also help keep your mind sharp as part of the MIND diet. The researchers recommend eating beans three times a week to help reduce the risk of Alzheimer\'s.\n\nWhole grains Tom Perkins Whole grains are a key component of the MIND diet. It recommends at least three servings a day.\n\nFish istockphoto The MIND diet study found eating fish at least once a week helps protect brain function. However, there\'s no need to go overboard; unlike the Mediterranean diet, which recommends eating fish almost every day, the MIND diet says once a week is enough.\n\nPoultry Shaiith Poultry is another part of a brain-healthy eating plan, according to the MIND diet. It recommends two or more servings a week.\n\nOlive oil istockphoto Olive oil beat out other forms of cooking oil and fats in the MIND diet. The researchers found people who used olive oil as their primary oil at home saw greater protection against cognitive decline.\n\nWine istockphoto Raise a toast to the MIND diet: it recommends a glass of wine every day. Just one, though. Wine rounds out the list of of 10 ""brain healthy"" food groups that help protect against Alzheimer\'s: green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. Now here are the five food groups it says you should avoid to reduce your risk of developing dementia...\n\nRed meat juniart Red meat isn\'t banned in the MIND diet, but the researchers say you should limit consumption to no more than four servings a week to help protect brain health. That\'s more generous than the Mediterranean diet, which restricts red meat to just one serving a week.\n\nButter and stick margarine istockphoto Butter and stick margarine should be limited to less than a tablespoon per day on the MIND diet. Brain-healthy olive oil can often be used instead.\n\nCheese istockphoto Cheese may be delicious but it doesn\'t do your brain any favors, according to the MIND diet study. Eat cheese no more than once a week if you want to reduce your risk of Alzheimer\'s.\n\nPastries and sweets istockphoto You already know they\'re not so good for your waistline, and it turns out pastries and other sweets could have a negative effect on brain health as well. The MIND diet recommends limiting yourself to no more than five of these treats per week.']",Eating to protect heart health has become common.  This story left too much out to establish whether eating to protect brain deserves similar attention.,"The story compares the effects on Alzheimer’s disease of a Mediterranean diet, the DASH (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension) diet, and a hybrid of the two, the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet. The story focuses on the specific elements of the diet without critically appraising the research itself, and helping readers understand the limits of observational studies. Additionally, the story does not raise the issue that only relative risks were reported in the study, not absolute risk of Alzheimer’s, making the impact of the diet appear greater than it is.

""People can prevent heart disease reoccurrence using their own mind-body connection. People have this internal self-healing ability.""\n\nAn outside expert, however, said the study is too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease.\n\nThe new study focused on Transcendental Meditation. Originally from India, it is not associated with any particular religion or philosophy. It is thought to produce alpha brain waves that occur in deep relaxation. According to the Maharishi Foundation, more than 5 million people worldwide practice this type of meditation.\n\nThe research focused on blacks because they are at a higher risk than whites of having heart attacks and strokes and dying from heart disease, Schneider said. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations.\n\n""Other studies have been done among whites and the results are similar,"" he said.\n\nThe report was published in the Nov. 13 issue of the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. The study was sponsored by the Maharishi University of Management and funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\nFor the study, Schneider\'s team randomly assigned 201 black Americans with heart disease either to a Transcendental Meditation stress-reducing program or health education class about lifestyle modification in diet and exercise.\n\nAlmost 60 percent of the participants were taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Forty-one percent of the meditation group took aspirin, as did 31 percent of the health education group; 38 percent of the meditation group and 43 percent of the health education group smoked, the researchers noted.\n\nParticipants\' average body-mass index -- a measurement of body fat based on height and weight -- was 32, which is considered obese.\n\nMeditation consisted of sitting with eyes closed for about 20 minutes twice a day. The goal was to rest while remaining alert.\n\nAfter more than five years of follow-up, the researchers found those who meditated saw significant reductions in blood pressure and anger compared to those receiving health education. In addition, 20 people in the medication group had a heart attack or stroke or died, compared with 32 in the health education group.\n\nBoth groups increased exercise and drank less. For those who meditated, there was a trend toward reduced smoking; however, this was not statistically significant.\n\nLearning how to do Transcendental Meditation isn\'t inexpensive. An initial 10-hour course runs about $1,500 when taught by nonprofit groups, and there is continued lifetime follow-up, Schneider said.\n\nAnd it\'s not something you can learn by yourself. ""You\'ve got to have a teacher right there in front of you teaching according to experience,"" he said. ""So it\'s only learned live.""\n\nTranscendental Meditation is not generally covered by health insurance, he said. ""One of the reasons we did the study is because insurance and Medicare calls for citing evidence for what\'s to be reimbursed,"" Schneider said. ""This study will lead toward reimbursement. That\'s the whole idea.""\n\nBut a cardiology expert said that although the study adds to evidence supporting meditation, it doesn\'t prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the practice and better health outcomes.\n\n""Transcendental Meditation has been reported to have health benefits and has been evaluated in a number of studies,"" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nSome studies have suggested favorable effects on cardiovascular risk factors whereas others studies have been inconclusive, he said.\n\nEven though the findings in this study were statistically significant, the new study was too small to be conclusive, Fonarow said.\n\n""In addition, since this study was conducted at a single center and the primary [change in heart attack, stroke and death] was not statistically significant without adjustment for other factors, more studies and replication of these findings are needed,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on heart disease, visit the American Heart Association.']","Thanks largely to the inclusion of an independent perspective, this HealthDay piece was much stronger than its counterpart from ","Though neither story picked up on the troubled history of this study (addressed here and here and in our review of the competing story from from TIME), HealthDay at least featured a reality check on the evidence high up in the story. Citing an independent expert, it called the study “too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease” — an assessment with which we concur.

In Japan, “food and health care companies have found cosmetic applications for their ingredients, so they are creating skin care brands.”\n\nFor example, Frutarom, a flavor-ingredient house based in Israel, makes Alguard, a purified polysaccharide shield from a red microalgae that it says protects skin from daily assaults and reduces roughness as well as the look of fine lines.\n\nThere are more than 100 algae-derived ingredients used in cosmetics worldwide, Mrs. Lewis said. The patent-pending alguronic acid in Algenist is a “single, purified, highly bioactive compound,” said Tony Day, the vice president for research and development at Solazyme, and therefore delivers “much higher activity to the skin” than products using only a microalgae extract.\n\nStudies conducted by an independent lab and commissioned by Algenist, none of which have been published in a peer-reviewed journal, showed alguronic acid increased cell regeneration and the synthesis of elastin (which gives skin that snap-back youthful quality). This testing also demonstrated that alguronic acid provided protection against cell damage induced by ultraviolet rays, and inhibited the enzymes that break down elastin.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter reviewing press materials and Solazyme’s 84-page patent application, Dr. David McDaniel, a dermatologist and the director of the Institute of Anti-Aging Research in Virginia Beach, Va., said he was impressed by the in-vitro testing of alguronic acid. “In the petri dish, their data seems to show some substantial benefits to their active ingredient,” he said. But he cautioned that in-vitro testing does not demonstrate how a final formulation works off the shelf.\n\nDr. Dana Sachs, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, wrote in an e-mail after looking at Algenist’s dossier that “the claims on cell regeneration and elastin synthesis are based on in vitro models, which is hard to extrapolate to in vivo, and again no statistical significance is presented, so this is a weak claim.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Day, who has a doctorate in biochemistry, said that statistical significance was found but not included in press materials. And, according to the company, a study of 30 women showed that after 10 days of using the Algenist serum, they had a 25 percent decrease in wrinkles as shown by silicone replicas of their faces.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The researchers found other fruits such as apples and pears were not associated with a decreased risk.\n\nTo study the relationship between berry consumption and heart disease, Cassidy and her collaborators at the Harvard School of Public Health analyzed findings from the Nurses Health Study 2 which includes more than 90,000 nurses in the U.S. Periodically over the past 18 years the nurses have reported details about their diets and lifestyles to researchers. At the same time, researchers have monitored the nurses\' health to see which diseases they go on to develop, or not.\n\nIt\'s certainly not a perfect way to detect how certain foods may influence health, but it identifies important associations. Cassidy says the association between berry consumption and heart disease was strengthened when she and her collaborators controlled for other reasons that could have explained the finding.\n\n""Even when we adjusted for things like fat intake, fiber intake, medication use, or body size, and for example, exercise, we still got these strong reductions in risk,"" Cassidy says.\n\nSo what\'s in blueberries that makes them so good for us? Researchers have pinpointed a class of plant compounds known as anthocyanins. These compounds give the red and blue color to everything from berries to eggplants to cherries. And when you eat a steady diet of them, they seem to have a number of positive health effects.\n\n""They have effects on blood pressure in animal models,"" says Cassidy. And in lab experiments they\'re shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects, as well as help modulate nitric oxide in the body, which could help arteries stay more elastic and flexible.\n\nAll of these effects could be beneficial, explains Robert Eckel, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Colorado. But he says it\'s important to point out that the women in this study weren\'t prime candidates for heart attacks anyway.\n\n""Having a heart attack when you\'re a woman between ages of 45 and 60 is distinctly unusual,"" says Eckel.\n\nWould the protective effect hold up for older women? Eckel says it\'s not clear.\n\n""But nonetheless, for the first time I think we have some evidence that the intake of theses anthocyanins may have a protective effect.""\n\nSo, go ahead. Load up on berries. And if they\'re out of season, like now, studies show frozen berries have similar levels of beneficial compounds.']",Best story out of the three reviewed on berries and heart attacks. NPR quotes an independent expert who talks about the study’s limitations – something that the ,"Even though it was better than the two competitors we also reviewed, the NPR story could have clarified a few points in its online version.
For example, although anthocyanin seems to be the likely component in reducing the risk for heart attacks, researchers are not completely sure, since the amount of anthocyanin cannot be measured. Researchers acknowledge that this protective effect may be due to another compound.
Also, the story doesn’t discuss harms, alternatives and costs – some of which may be understandable but not all of it. However, it does an excellent job in providing context for the study, quoting an independent source, and explaining that this study pointed to a statistical association, not cause-and-effect (although it could have stated the latter more clearly).

""That\'s a substantial change, and that was significant compared with the placebo group.""\n\nIsrael is director of the respiratory therapy department at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston.\n\nThe drug also improved overall airway function, an effect researchers hadn\'t expected, Israel said.\n\nPeople whose severe asthma isn\'t controlled despite use of high-dose steroid medications are at risk of declining lung function and poor quality of life, the researchers said in background notes.\n\nBut, this powerful cancer drug can\'t be recommended for them on the basis of this small study, Israel and other specialists noted.\n\nGleevec fights leukemia by blocking a specific receptor on cancerous white blood cells, inhibiting their ability to multiply and spread, Israel said.\n\nThat same action also affects mast cells, a type of white blood cell distributed throughout the body that promotes inflammation and causes allergic reactions, Israel said.\n\nFor example, mast cells in the skin are responsible for hives, while mast cells in the lungs have been associated with severe asthma, he said.\n\n""By blocking the signal that helps keep mast cells alive, we were hoping to reduce the number of these cells,"" Israel said. ""By doing that, we hoped to produce improvements beyond the maximal therapy that these patients with severe asthma are on.""\n\nIsrael and his colleagues recruited 62 severe asthma sufferers for the study. All received top-notch asthma treatment, and were randomly assigned to take either Gleevec or a placebo pill once daily during the 6-month trial.\n\nBlood tests showed that Gleevec did reduce mast cell activity in patients, Israel said.\n\nFurther, allergy challenge tests showed a decrease in airway reactivity among patients taking Gleevec, the researchers reported. Airways became less likely to close off after exposure to an allergen.\n\nPhysical examinations showed that people taking Gleevec actually experienced a slight overall widening of their airways, Israel added.\n\n""There was a small but significant improvement in the airway narrowing in these patients, which we didn\'t expect because we didn\'t think the mast cells were necessarily promoting that airway narrowing all the time,"" Israel said.\n\nSide-effects were not as severe as expected, he added. One person dropped out because of a sharp decline in white blood cells, which bounced back after the drug was discontinued. Another person dropped out because of leg cramps associated with the drug.\n\n""All in all, we were expecting a significantly greater pattern of side-effects, and we didn\'t see it,"" Israel explained.\n\nAccording to Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, ""This drug represents a new mechanism for the immune modulation of severe asthma."" Horovitz was not involved with the study.\n\n""It has been a while since a new approach and treatment for severe asthma has emerged,"" Horovitz said. ""Further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma.""\n\nPulmonologist Dr. Theodore Maniatis is medical director of Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. He sounded a more cautionary note.\n\n""This is a very early work that in no way should encourage asthmatics,"" Maniatis said. ""While it is a very interesting study for pulmonologists and immunologists, it is a very small study.""\n\nUntil now, ""this immune-modulating drug has been used only for cancer and is toxic,"" he added. ""It will take years of study to determine the usefulness of this drug in treatment.""\n\nIsrael agreed that further clinical trials are needed. ""Before you go out and recommend this be used in general, you really want to repeat this in a larger population with greater numbers,"" he said.\n\nIt likely will be three to four years before Gleevec could be approved for asthma treatment, Israel estimated.\n\nIf proven effective, Gleevec might provide a relatively inexpensive new treatment for asthma patients. Two generic versions of the drug were launched last year, which could make it less pricey than new-wave asthma drugs headed for the market, Israel added.\n\nThe study was published May 18 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on asthma, visit the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.']","Considering how preliminary this trial is, there’s not a lot of news value to lay readers who are hoping for new asthma treatment options.","A headline that ends in a question mark can often be answered with the word no. That adage applies here, in a story about a 62-person trial that tested whether leukemia drug imatinib, sold by Novartis and marketed as Gleevec, could be used to treat severe asthma. Published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the results of the 24-week “proof-of-principal” trial are too preliminary to draw conclusions about the drug’s usefulness for this purpose, so there’s marginal news value here.
Still, we appreciated that the story included cautious quotes from two independent experts and made it clear that the study was “very small” and that it will “take years of study to determine the usefulness of this drug in treatment.”

These vessels are then blocked with particles the size of a grain of sand.\n\nA similar procedure is sometimes used to treat another kind of benign growth, uterine fibroids, in women.\n\n“It was my inspiration -- uterine fibroids.

Study results were also endorsed in 11 accompanying editorials from leading experts in psychiatry, addiction, and palliative care.\n\n“Our results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy, with the potential to transform care for patients with cancer-related psychological distress,” says study lead investigator Stephen Ross, MD, director of substance abuse services in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU Langone.\n\n“If larger clinical trials prove successful, then we could ultimately have available a safe, effective, and inexpensive medication — dispensed under strict control — to alleviate the distress that increases suicide rates among cancer patients,” says Ross, also an associate professor of psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine.\n\nStudy co-investigator Jeffrey Guss, MD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, notes that psilocybin has been studied for decades and has an established safety profile. Study participants, he says, experienced no serious negative effects, such as hospitalization or more serious mental health conditions.\n\nAlthough the neurological benefits of psilocybin are not completely understood, it has been proven to activate parts of the brain also impacted by the signaling chemical serotonin, which is known to control mood and anxiety. Serotonin imbalances have also been linked to depression.\n\nFor the study, half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive a 0.3 milligrams per kilogram dose of psilocybin while the rest received a vitamin placebo (250 milligrams of niacin) known to produce a “rush” that mimics a hallucinogenic drug experience.\n\nApproximately half way through the study’s monitoring period (after seven weeks), all participants switched treatments. Those who initially received psilocybin took a single dose of placebo, and those who first took niacin, then received psilocybin. Neither patients nor researchers knew who had first received psilocybin or placebo. Guss says, “The randomization, placebo control, and double-blind procedures maximized the validity of the study results.”\n\nOne of the key findings was that improvements in clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression lasted for the remainder of the study’s extended monitoring period — specifically, eight months for those who took psilocybin first.\n\nAll patients in the study — mostly women age 22 to 75 who are or were patients at the Perlmutter Cancer Center of NYU Langone — had either advanced breast, gastrointestinal, or blood cancers and had been diagnosed as suffering from serious psychological distress related to their disease. All patients, who volunteered to be part of the study, were provided with tailored counseling from a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse or social worker, and were monitored for side effects and improvements in their mental state.\n\nCo-investigator Anthony Bossis, PhD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, says patients also reported post-psilocybin improvements in their quality of life: going out more, greater energy, getting along better with family members, and doing well at work. Several also reported variations of spirituality, unusual peacefulness, and increased feelings of altruism.\n\n“Our study showed that psilocybin facilitated experiences that drove reductions in psychological distress,” says Bossis. “And if it’s true for cancer care, then it could apply to other stressful medical conditions.”\n\nBossis cautions that patients should not consume psilocybin on their own or without supervision by a physician and a trained counselor. He also says “Psilocybin therapy may not work for everyone, and some groups, such as people with schizophrenia, as well as adolescents, should not be treated with it.”\n\nBoth the NYU Langone and Johns Hopkins studies were principally funded by the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit, scientific institution with the principal mission of helping to design, review and fund studies on the use of psilocybin for a wide range of ailments (Ross previously served as a board member). Additional funding for the NYU Langone study was provided by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, part of the National Institutes of Health (UL1 TR000038). The drug used in the study was manufactured by Organix Inc. in Woburn, Mass.\n\nBesides Ross, Guss, and Bossis, other NYU researchers involved in this study are Gabrielle Agin-Liebes, BS; Tara Malone, MA; Alexander Belser, MPhil; Krystallia Kalliontzi, MSc; Barry Cohen, PhD; Sarah Mennenga, PhD; James Babb, PhD; Zhe Su, MS, MA; Patricia Corby, DDS; and Brian Schmidt, MD, PhD.\n\nMedia Inquiries: David March/Jim Mandler212-404-3528/212-404-3525david.march@nyumc.org/jim.mandler@nyumc.org']",More specifics on the degree of reduced anxiety and depression as well as a description of side effects would have been useful.,"This release focuses on a recent study that found a single application of the hallucinogen psilocybin is effective at providing meaningful relief to cancer patients suffering from severe depression or anxiety. The release notes that 80 percent of participants showed improvement based on clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression for several months following the treatment.
The study is one of two on the subject that were published recently in the Journal of Psychopharmacology (our review of the release for the other study can be found here and a review of a related news article can be read here.) The release does better than its counterpart in terms of addressing conflicts of interest and placing the work in context with previous work in the field. However, the release uses only vague language when addressing the key issues of health benefits and adverse side effects. More specifics on the degree of reduced anxiety and depression scores would have been useful.

Not yet. Give me three more months. I\'ll be good!"" So they try with renewed vigor to control their disease without insulin through diet, exercise and oral medications. Inevitably, many patients lapse and their diabetes again slips out of control, doing invisible damage to their kidneys, nervous systems and cardiovascular health.\n\nMany patients are afraid of needles or embarrassed at the prospect of carrying syringes and the associated stigma of "" shooting up"" before a meal. But pain and inconvenience aside, injectable insulin also carries a medical risk — hypoglycemia. This occurs when blood glucose falls too low, a common occurrence in people who\'ve injected insulin that acts longer than needed, and one that can, in extreme circumstances, prove fatal.\n\nFor the nation\'s 23 million diabetics and 57 million pre-diabetics, many of whom use insulin, a better way to deliver insulin could be life-changing, enabling them to use insulin therapy earlier in the progression of their disease and reducing the long-term damage. And it could be possible.\n\nTwo products that could get insulin into the bloodstream without needle sticks are in the latter stages of clinical trials, with their makers hoping for Food and Drug Administration approval in the next two years.\n\nOne is administered via oral spray; the other is delivered via inhaler. Still more are in earlier phases of development. Together they offer the potential for treating the disease in a less onerous, less obvious, less painful fashion.\n\n""Soon after insulin was discovered in the 1920s, doctors immediately recognized that it would be an advantage if they could get it into the body without injection,"" says Dr. Gerald Bernstein, vice president for medical affairs for Generex, which developed the spray.\n\nBut getting insulin, a very large protein, past the body\'s protective barriers and absorbed across small patches of surface area has proved difficult.\n\nBetter delivery system\n\nInjectable insulin is familiar — it\'s been around for 80 years — but it has drawbacks. The hormone must be injected multiple times throughout the day to help the body store glucose properly and keep bloodstream levels low.

It is also associated with an increased risk for depression, heart disease and diabetes, among other conditions.\n\nIxekizumab works by neutralizing a pathway in the immune system known to promote psoriasis.\n\nTo test the drug\'s efficacy over time - and to help clinicians determine whether its benefits outweigh any risks - the three studies enrolled a total of 3,736 adult patients at more than 100 study sites in 21 countries. All participants had moderate to severe psoriasis, which is defined as covering 10 percent or more of the body. Patients were randomly assigned to receive injections of ixekizumab at various doses or a placebo over a period of more than a year.\n\nThe investigators assessed whether the drug reduced the severity of psoriasis symptoms compared to the placebo and evaluated safety by monitoring adverse events.

By the 60th week, 68.7 to 78.3 percent of patients had maintained their improvement.\n\n""Based on these findings, we expect that 80 percent of patients will have an extremely high response rate to ixekizumab, and about 40 percent will be completely cleared of psoriasis,"" Gordon said. ""Ten years ago, we thought complete clearance of this disease was impossible. It wasn\'t something we would even try to do.

In doing so, readers learn the basics about what Genentech has revealed about the drug, baloxavir marboxil, and how it works. We were especially pleased to see a discussion about how much it might cost, if approved.
We would have liked to have seen—and think readers would have benefitted from—a more critical review that explained that the study Genentech presented to the FDA for review has not been peer reviewed or published, which means no one other than the drug’s manufacturer has seen the actual data analysis.
We also do not think readers benefit from an article that doesn’t question who benefits from potential approval of a new flu drug that “could upend treatment” before the next flu season. Why? Because we’ve seen this excitement before. There was a lot of enthusiasm about Tamiflu when it was first introduced. But in all the hoopla about Tamiflu being able to reduce the duration of flu symptoms–by a day!–an important point was lost. Yes, the flu makes you miserable. But the real concern about the flu is that in some populations–in particular children, the elderly, and those with impaired immune systems or other health conditions– the flu can be deadly. Yet there is limited evidence that Tamiflu will prevent flu-related complications, hospitalization, or death.
Lastly, and importantly, the story left out any discussion of side effects. For an in-depth look at why this matters, see Drug kills flu in a day, news headlines claim. Here’s why that’s bad for public health.

Instead, it was shocking.\n\nThe carotid artery on the left side of my neck, one of the brain’s two main sources of blood and oxygen, was clogged with fatty plaque, the doctor said. The artery was almost completely blocked.\n\nThere must be a mistake, I thought frantically. I exercise and am healthy and young. Actually, I’m 68, but, you know, a young 68. You are in danger of a major stroke, she said, and need an operation. Immediately.\n\nThe irony wasn’t lost on me. As a journalist covering the medical field, I have spent years writing about strokes, most of which are caused by clots blocking blood flow to the brain. Now I faced the unnerving question: Am I going to become a weird punch line? As in: Did you see that the guy who writes all those stories about strokes just had a big one?\n\nA blocked carotid artery didn’t seem possible for an active person like me. I’ve never smoked. I’ve run, lifted weights or done something aerobic like playing tennis pretty much every day of my life. I watch what I eat. I even wrote an article about how I kept my bad cholesterol in check with diet and exercise, not medication.\n\nWhile I’m addicted to cheese, and my weight has climbed some, I’ve eaten foods like salmon and oatmeal with fervor for more than 20 years. So I figured I was exempt from medical crises.\n\nThe diagnosis made me reconsider dilemmas that had once seemed academic. For example, should older Americans be screened for blocked carotid arteries?\n\nCritical Paths The carotid arteries are passageways through which blood and oxygen move to a person's brain and face. When fatty plaque obstructs an artery, the blood supply can be reduced or cut off, sometimes resulting in a stroke.

Carotid disease is a main cause of those strokes—nearly 200,000 strokes a year, vascular specialists say. Yet 80% of those patients have no symptoms before the strokes.\n\nIn 2014, a U.S. task force concluded that people with no symptoms don’t have to be screened for carotid disease, saying that the risks, such as poor surgery, “outweigh the benefits.” But the task force—a panel of private doctors assigned by law to help set U.S. medical policy—focused on screening in the general population, not older patients.\n\nThe task force said there aren’t enough carotid-caused strokes to warrant screening everyone. Of course, not everyone with carotid blockage will get surgery; thousands of people with the condition can benefit from drug therapy.\n\nMy experience, along with some evidence from screening of thousands of individuals, raises questions about the task force’s conclusions. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends screening people over 65 with coronary disease, high blood pressure or a history of smoking.\n\nThe task force generally supports screening Americans for breast cancer, with 253,000 new cases in women and 41,000 estimated deaths annually, as well as colorectal cancer, with 135,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths a year. Government and private insurance pay to screen for these illnesses, but not for carotid screening of non-symptomatic people, which can cost about $70 a person.\n\nAfter hearing the jarring news about my dangerously blocked carotid, I faced a big decision. My wife Christa and I live near Washington, D.C. Our daughter, Maddie, was supposed to be married in San Francisco in June, a week after the neurologist told me I needed surgery right away. Suddenly the prospect of being at the wedding seemed iffy.\n\nConventional wisdom says that among the 65-and-older set, only those with symptoms should be tested. That often means individuals who have had mini-strokes, which tend to be brief periods in which the patient has something wrong on one side of the body, usually for a few minutes. Symptoms often include slurred speech, temporary vision loss, a one-sided facial droop and arm or leg weakness or numbness.\n\nVascular surgeon George Lavenson Jr. wrote in 2012 in the Journal for Vascular Ultrasound that among 22,146 people screened for carotid disease during four public screening campaigns between 2001 and 2006, about 7.5% were found to have blockage of 60% or more—enough to warrant treatment with medication.\n\n“It is hard to understand how many leaders in the medical profession can object to a one- to two-minute accurate screen of seniors that can find the 7.5% with silent carotid artery disease,” Dr. Lavenson said. Those patients can be “evaluated and managed to prevent them from being one of the 700,000 clot-caused strokes we continue to have annually.”\n\nMost doctors would have put me in the asymptomatic, or less-risky, category. But five years ago, I went out for a run of about 7 miles along the Potomac River. At the end of the run, my right leg started shaking. That seldom happened again until the past few months, when it started recurring more often, along with shaking in the right arm.\n\nMy physician, Joel Taubin, recommended a neurologist, Rhanni Herzfeld, of the Neurology Center in Washington. She prescribed tests to discern the cause of the shaking, perhaps a pinched nerve, incipient epilepsy, a neurological disorder or a tumor. The results ruled them all out.\n\nThen an MRI of my head showed a few white spots on the left side. Dr. Herzfeld wondered if I might have had some “silent strokes,” sending tiny bits of artery plaque floating to my brain—and now appearing as white spots on the scan. Fatty plaque accumulates in most people’s arteries, and can form clots that break off and can cause strokes.\n\nDr. Herzfeld ordered a carotid ultrasound of the arteries on both sides of my neck. It’s a quick, painless and very accurate scan. Moments later, we were talking in her office. My right carotid artery was perfectly clear, she said. The left was almost completely blocked and I needed immediate surgery to clear it.\n\nI asked if we could treat the obstruction with anti-platelet medication, such as Plavix.\n\n“No, your blockage is just too extensive,” Dr. Herzfeld said. She recommended that Bruce A. Perler, a professor of vascular surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, do the procedure.\n\nThe effectiveness of carotid-artery surgery in people without symptoms—but major blockage—was established two decades ago by the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis trial, funded by the National Institutes of Health. It showed, in hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, that the risk of stroke or death in surgery patients after a median 2.7 years was 5.1%, less than half that of people treated only with drugs. An international study published in 2010 in the Lancet showed similar benefits from surgery.\n\nI consulted with other doctors, including one who said, “This isn’t quite an emergency, but it’s urgent.”\n\nThe operation is serious, with the rates of stroke and death within 30 days after surgery totaling about 2.4% in major studies examined by the task force. The task force noted that this typical measure can be as high as 5% at some low-volume hospitals.\n\nPeople considering this operation should ask their hospital, surgeon or academic medical center about their rates of stroke and death after surgery. Few hospitals and surgeons in the U.S. publish their individual results. Dr. Perler’s rate was well under 1%. He said my risk of stroke was 10% to 15% over five years, probably in the first year.\n\nA week before Maddie’s wedding, my wife and I met with Dr. Perler at Johns Hopkins. On the drive to Baltimore, we called Maddie. She sounded frightened and I told her maybe I wouldn’t need surgery—or could put it off. We also told her brothers, Jamie and Will, and her sister, Samantha, what was going on.\n\nDr. Perler’s test confirmed Dr. Herzfeld’s findings: I definitely needed surgery. My artery was almost completely obstructed by “echolucent” plaque—a type that can easily form clots, break off and cause strokes.\n\nWe discussed timing. Dr. Perler’s next surgery day was June 18. That would leave me four days to recover before the wedding. He warned that I would be “miserable” doing that. But his next surgery day after that wasn’t until June 27.\n\n“You can safely wait until next week,” he said, “but I wouldn’t wait two months.” Then he added the words I remember most: “We’ll take good care of you.”\n\nMy wife and I decided on June 27—and headed to San Francisco for the wedding. It was an untraditional ceremony with no white veil or a parade of bridesmaids. Maddie wore a champagne-colored, beaded dress. I have never seen her so happy—except maybe when she was playing My Little Pony as a 6-year-old. I was simply happy to be there.\n\nTom Burton and his daughter, Maddie, at her wedding to Dan Powers at San Francisco City Hall in June, less than a week before Mr. Burton’s surgery to unblock a carotid artery. Photo: Christina Richards Photography\n\nOn the morning of June 27, Dr. Perler started operating at 7:30. Within two hours, he had cleared the plaque from my carotid artery. Later, he told me it was so clogged—about 99%—he couldn’t even detect a pulse in it.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was relieved to see that my eyes and fingers all worked. I could think and speak clearly. I was even able to complain to the nurses about how lousy I felt.\n\nI spent two days in intensive care, with my blood pressure surging at times. About two weeks after the operation, I felt pretty normal. I’ve resumed running and weight-lifting. I recently played golf for the first time since the surgery and feel great.\n\nBut mostly I feel lucky to have gotten a test that may have saved my life.\n\nGetting Screened A national company, Life Line Screening, will do a carotid screen for $70, or with other tests such as for aortic aneurysms, for $149.\n\nHospitals’ accredited labs will do carotid ultrasound tests typically for $200 to $300, but usually only on a doctor’s order.\n\nInsurers, private and government, generally will pay only if the patient has symptoms, including a mini-stroke.\n\nThe Society for Vascular Surgery’s site, vascular.org, can direct people to specialists who can do testing.\n\nWrite to Thomas M. Burton at tom.burton@wsj.com""]","Also, discussion of carotid artery screening of people who do not have symptoms is mixed up with the reporter’s experience with testing done in order to diagnose the cause of his symptoms.","The story about a reporter’s decision to treat a carotid artery blockage exemplifies the powerful strengths and weaknesses of first-person health care reporting. It carries a powerful emotional punch and an apparently happy ending that overwhelms the evidence presented. Numerous psychology studies document the power of “outcome bias,” in which the results of a decision affect beliefs about whether the decision was correct or not. We are very happy that all went well, but it is reasonable to assume this story would have looked very different if had not.
There is no mention of the costs of the surgical procedure. Neither is carotid stenting mentioned as an alternative to endarterectomy surgery. Discussion of carotid artery screening of people who do not have symptoms is mixed up with the reporter’s experience with testing done in order to diagnose the cause of symptoms – a somewhat common flaw of conflating diagnostic testing with screening tests. The risk that the surgery could trigger a stroke, including a fatal one, is highlighted, but the risk statistics reported here are lower than those published in major summaries of the evidence.

Writing in the January 6, 2015 issue of the journal Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Disease, a team of scientists and physicians from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, with counterparts at University of California, Los Angeles, describe a novel imaging technique that measurably improves upon current prostate imaging – and may have significant implications for how patients with prostate cancer are ultimately treated.\n\n“This new approach is a more reliable imaging technique for localizing tumors. It provides a better target for biopsies, especially for smaller tumors,” said Rebecca Rakow-Penner, MD, PhD, a research resident in the Department of Radiology and the study’s first author.\n\nThe technique is also valuable in surgical planning and image staging, said David S. Karow, MD, PhD, assistant professor of radiology at UC San Diego and the study’s corresponding author. “Doctors at UC San Diego and UCLA now have a non-invasive imaging method to more accurately assess the local extent of the tumor and possibly predict the grade of the tumor, which can help them more precisely and effectively determine appropriate treatment.”\n\nThe current standard of care for detecting and diagnosing prostate cancer is contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which involves intravenously injecting patients with a contrast agent to highlight blood flow. Greater blood flow is often a requirement of growing cancer cells. When compared to surrounding healthy tissues, it’s hoped that contrast enhanced MRIs will reveal the shape and nature of any tumors present.\n\nBut many tumors do not significantly differ from surrounding healthy tissues with contrast enhanced MRI and so evade easy detection. An imaging technique called diffusion MRI measures the diffusion of water and has been a standard imaging technique in the brain and an emerging technique in the prostate. Cancer tissues are denser than healthy tissues and typically limit the amount and mobility of water within them. But diffusion MRI suffers from magnetic field artifacts that can distort the actual location of tumors by as much as 1.2 centimeters or roughly half an inch – a significant distance when surgeons are attempting, for example, to assess whether a tumor extends beyond the prostate and into adjacent nerve bundles.\n\nThe new approach described in today’s published paper is called restriction spectrum imaging-MRI or RSI-MRI. It corrects for magnetic field distortions and focuses upon water diffusion within tumor cells. By doing both, the ability of imaging to accurately plot a tumor’s location is increased and there is a more refined sense of the tumor’s extent, said Nathan White, PhD, assistant project scientist at UC San Diego, study co-author and co-inventor of the RSI-MRI technique.\n\nIn a related paper to be published in the journal Frontiers in Oncology, the same team of researchers reported that RSI-MRI appears to predict tumor grade. Higher grade tumors correlate with higher restricted water volume in the cancer cells’ large nuclei.\n\n“Prostate cancer can often be an indolent disease, where a patient may only require surveillance rather than aggressive surgery,” noted co-author Christopher J. Kane, MD, professor of urology at UC San Diego.\n\n“If by imaging we could predict the tumor grade,” added Robert Reiter, MD, professor of urology at UCLA, “we may be able to spare some patients from prostate resection and monitor their cancer with imaging.”\n\nCo-authors include senior author Anders M. Dale, Hyung W. Choi, Joshua M. Kuperman, Natalie M. Schenker-Ahmed, Hauke Bartsch, Robert F. Mattrey and William G. Bradley, Department of Radiology, UCSD; J. Kellogg Parsons and Michael A. Liss, Department of Urology, UCSD; Ahmed Shabaik, Department of Pathology, UCSD; Jiaoti Huang, Department of Pathology, UCLA; Daniel J. Margolis and Steven S. Raman, Department of Radiology, UCLA; Leonard S. Marks, Department of Urology, UCLA.\n\nFunding for this research was provided, in part, by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering of the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, Prostate Cancer Research Program, the American Cancer Society and the UC San Diego Clinician Scientist Program.']",Many bold and unsupported claims are made in this vague news release about a new technique for imaging prostate cancers.,"
This news release is about a new method of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for use in the diagnosis and guiding of treatment for prostate cancer. The release claims that the new technique “measurably improves upon current prostate imaging,”  is “more reliable” than existing techniques, and “provides a better target for biopsies.” No data are provided to support any of these assertions, and the original study that sparked the release included just 27 patients and should be considered highly preliminary. Even the title of that study calls the results merely a “proof of principle.”

A group of researchers led by Dr. Christine Beeton at Baylor College of Medicine has found that one of the hundreds of components in scorpion venom can reduce the severity of the disease in animal models, without inducing side effects associated with similar treatments. The study appears in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.\n\n""Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease - one in which the immune system attacks its own body. In this case, it affects the joints,"" said Beeton, associate professor of molecular physiology and biophysics and member Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. ""Cells called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a major role in the disease. As they grow and move from joint to joint, they secrete products that damage the joints and attract immune cells that cause inflammation and pain. As damage progresses, the joints become enlarged and are unable to move.""\n\nCurrent treatments target the immune cells involved in the disease and none are specific for FLS. Beeton and her colleagues studied FLS looking for an \'Achilles\' heel\' that would allow them to prevent or stop them from damaging the joints.\n\n""In previous work, we identified a potassium channel on FLS of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and found that the channel was very important for the development of the disease,"" Beeton said. ""We wanted to find a way to block the channel to stop the cells damaging the joints.""\n\nPotassium channels work by opening gates on the surface of cells that allow potassium ions - small charged atoms - to flow in and out of the cell. The flow of ions through the channels is necessary for the cells to carry out many of their essential functions. Animals such as scorpions have venoms that block potassium and other ion channels. They use the venoms to paralyze and kill prey. Decades ago, scientists discovered this and realized that, if handled correctly, venoms also might have medicinal applications.\n\nScorpion venom may lead to improved treatments for rheumatoid arthritis\n\n""Scorpion venom has hundreds of different components. One of the components in the venom of the scorpion called Buthus tamulus specifically blocks the potassium channel of FLS and not the channels in other cells such as those of the nervous system,"" said first author Dr. Mark Tanner, a graduate student in the Beeton lab during the development of this project. ""Here, we investigated whether this venom component, called iberiotoxin, would be able to specifically block the FLS potassium channel and reduce the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis in rat models of the disease.""\n\nWhen the researchers treated rat models of the disease with iberiotoxin, they stopped the progression of the disease. In some cases they reversed the signs of established disease, meaning that the animals had better joint mobility and less inflammation in their joints. In addition, treatment with iberiotoxin did not induce side effects, such as tremors and incontinence, observed when treating with another channel blocker called paxilline.\n\n""It was very exciting to see that iberiotoxin is very specific for the potassium channel in FLS and that it did not seem to affect the channels in other types of cells, which might explain the lack of tremors and incontinence,"" Tanner said.\n\n""Although these results are promising, much more research needs to be conducted before we can use scorpion venom components to treat rheumatoid arthritis,"" Beeton said. ""We think that this venom component, iberiotoxin, can become the basis for developing a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the future.""\n\n###\n\nOther contributors of this work include Michael W. Pennington, Brayden H. Chamberlain, Redwan Huq, Elizabeth J. Gehrmann, Teresina Laragione and Pércio S. Gulko.

Tissue plasminogen activator, known as tPA, can dramatically reverse stroke symptoms in those whose strokes are caused by blood clots and blockages, which account for an estimated 85 percent of all strokes.\n\nStrokes strike about 795,000 Americans each year, killing 137,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States.\n\n""A tool that can estimate the age of stroke would be of great value in cases of unknown stroke onset time,"" said lead researcher Dr. Catherine Oppenheim, professor of radiology at Universite Paris Descartes in France. ""This concerns as many as a quarter of all stroke patients who cannot be given tPA because they wake up with stroke symptoms or are unable to say when their stroke began.""\n\nUnder current guidelines, patients who awaken with symptoms are arbitrarily excluded from tPA therapy, Oppenheim said, because the onset is considered to be the last time the patient was symptom-free, which might have been the night before.\n\nThe clot-busting drug is recommended for use only within 4.5 hours of stroke onset because it carries a risk of brain hemorrhage, a potentially fatal prospect, with the risk increasing as more time passes.\n\nThe study, reported online Nov. 2 and in the December issue of the journal Radiology, reinforces results from similar research, Oppenheim said. Her team reviewed MRI images from 130 patients treated for clot-caused strokes at Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris between May 2006 and October 2008.\n\nOf those patients, whose average age was 64.7 years, 63 underwent MRI within three hours of stroke onset and 67 were imaged between three and 12 hours afterwards. With the MRI data, radiologists could predict with more than 90 percent accuracy which patients had experienced stroke symptoms for longer than three hours.\n\nHowever, the study did not compare patients with unknown stroke onset who received tPA to those who did not, Oppenheim said.\n\n""Providing stroke neurologists with a reliable marker of stroke age will help to ensure that patients . . . are managed as urgently as those with known stroke onset time,"" she said. ""These results will be useful for centers that offer 24-hour access to acute stroke patients. The main limitation is the limited access to MRI in emergency rooms worldwide.""\n\nOppenheim said the next step would be clinical trials to validate whether MRIs serve as a ""surrogate clock"" for stroke onset.\n\nSeveral doctors specializing in stroke care were encouraged by Oppenheim\'s study, though they cautioned further research would be necessary to determine if the results could be replicated.\n\n""It\'s potentially helpful, and I don\'t know that it would take years to prove that,"" said Dr. Larry B. Goldstein, director of the Duke University Stroke Center in Durham, N.C.\n\nGoldstein noted that about 40 percent of stroke patients who arrive at his facility within two hours of symptom onset receive tPA. If they don\'t, ""the major reason . . . is that they get there too late,"" he said.\n\nDr. Wally Ghurabi, emergency department director at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, said a group of ongoing studies there include a similar focus on MRIs and stroke.\n\n""Really pinpointing the time of onset is so crucial for us. This will definitely give us that edge,"" Ghurabi said. ""I\'ve seen it with my own eyes -- a 60-year-old male or female patient comes into the ER and they\'re not able to move on one side or speak. A couple of hours later [after therapy], they can walk and talk. What more could we as doctors want?""\n\nDr. David F. Kallmes, an interventional neuro-radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., was also optimistic about Oppenheim\'s results.\n\nThe MRI is ""trying to act as a surrogate clock,"" said Kallmes, who edited Oppenheim\'s journal article. ""Like any imaging technique, it has a certain accuracy but it won\'t be perfect. It\'s certainly an innovative approach for patients with stroke-like symptoms.""\n\nIn October 2008, the American Heart Association, the American Stroke Association and the European Stroke Association revised their guidelines to recommend that tPA be used up to 4.5 hours after the onset of an ischemic (clot-caused) stroke, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet revised its approved treatment window of 3 hours.\n\nA study in The Lancet Neurology also found that a slight increase in deaths and bleeding in an extended treatment group over a three-month follow-up period underlined the notion that treatment within 3 hours -- although not required -- is still optimal.\n\nMore information\n\nReview the warning signs of stroke at the American Stroke Association.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A fairly good overview of an interesting study.  But failing to discuss the availability of MRI for the urgent use proposed – and then the cost of that use – were two significant oversights. </span>","This is a story about the possible use of MRI scans to help determine the onset time of stroke.  It provided a clear explanation about how this can be an issue for people who awaken to find that they have had a stroke sometime while sleeping or someone who knows when their symptoms of stroke began but are able to articulate this information.  The story explained that the decision about whether to treat a person who has had a stroke with the medication tPA rests on this piece of information.  While discussing the results of the soon to be published story, the story indicated that these results need to be validated before the technology could be adopted for this purpose.

It also found that the protective effect increases with age. The study is by Peter Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and colleagues, and has been published online by the journal the Lancet. A previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin (75-300 milligrams) reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third. The latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers.\n\nNew Aspirin-Cancer Findings The study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving 25,570 patients, 674 of whom died from cancer. They showed a 21% reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin, compared with people who had not. The investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time. After five years, death rates were shown to fall by 34% for all cancers and by 54% for gastrointestinal cancers. Participants were also followed up after 20 years, by which point 1,634 of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer. This 20-year follow-up established that the risk of cancer death remained 20% lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers, including lung, prostate, brain, bladder, and kidney cancers, and by 35% for gastrointestinal cancers. The fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer: Esophageal cancer (60%)\n\nColorectal cancer (40%)\n\nLung cancer (30%)\n\nProstate cancer (10%) Reductions in pancreatic, stomach, and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths, the authors say.']",Readers of this story are likely to believe that there is no longer any serious doubt about aspirin’s ability to prevent cancer. Cautionary statements are buried and muted.,"Of the three stories we reviewed, this one provided the most numbers to describe the study on the anti-cancer benefits of aspirin, but it ended up presenting a picture of the study that was too boosterish and not not realistic enough about the limitations of the study, the potential harms, and the costs.

The announcement does not affect Avastin\'s status as an approved therapy for lung cancer, kidney cancer, colorectal cancer and brain cancer.\n\nReflecting splits in the medical community, the European Medicines Agency said Thursday that Avastin would remain an approved therapy for breast cancer in European Union countries, although only in one particular combination: with the drug paclitaxel.\n\nAvastin, first approved as a cancer treatment in 2004, helps by inhibiting a tumor\'s blood supply. In 2008, the FDA granted Avastin what\'s known as accelerated approval of its use as a therapy for metastatic breast cancer -- cancer that has spread from one part of the body to another. The move was based on data in one preliminary study known as E2100. At that time, researchers reported that Avastin, when used in combination with other drugs, extended the time that patients went without their illness getting worse, a measure known as progression-free survival, or PFS.\n\nAlong with the initial approval, the FDA required Genentech, Avastin\'s maker, to complete larger studies. The results of those studies were a bitter pill for patients thriving on Avastin and researchers excited by the promise of the early data. The E2100 study found that for women taking Avastin plus paclitaxel, the cancer stopped spreading for an average of five-and-a-half months more, compared to those just taking standard chemotherapy. In the subsequent three larger studies, the benefit was much smaller, ranging from just 24 days to about two months.\n\nNone of the studies, including the E2100 study, showed that patients getting Avastin lived longer than patients on standard chemotherapies. ""We now have four studies that show no survival benefit,"" Woodcock said.\n\nAlong with those disappointing findings, serious side effects became apparent in patients taking Avastin, including high blood pressure, internal bleeding, perforated internal organs, heart failure and heart attacks, and in some cases, even swelling of the brain.\n\nBased on the new data, an FDA advisory panel voted 12-1 to reverse the accelerated approval in July.\n\nThursday\'s announcement is only a first step in removing the FDA\'s approval for this drug in treating breast cancer patients. As part of the complex process, Genentech has a right to appeal, and company spokeswoman Charlotte Arnold said it would request a hearing to press its case.\n\nPhysicians who favor Avastin\'s use say the FDA is being overly cautious, and that the drug can be used safely if patients are closely monitored.\n\n""This is a very sad and confusing day for our patients,"" said Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York. ""Survival was consistently better at one year in all of the studies, indicating that this is a safe and effective option. What makes this even more frustrating is that the drug will still be available to prescribe, but will only be an option for those who can afford it rather than those who really need it.""\n\nAvastin\'s cost, which can run to several thousand dollars a month, has sometimes been used as an example by critics of the health care system who fear that cost-cutting may win out over patient care. After the advisory committee\'s decision in July, Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote a letter to the FDA complaining that ""the (FDA advisory) committee\'s concerns appear to have been based on cost-effectiveness,"" and adding that a reversal on accelerated approval would amount to ""cost-rationing.""\n\nThe FDA says it does not consider cost when evaluating the safety or effectiveness of a drug.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said it\'s clear that ""some women with metastatic breast cancer have benefited from Avastin, but others not only have not benefited, they\'ve been harmed.\n\n""What we clearly need is a way for doctors to more accurately predict which women will have a better chance of benefitting from this important targeted therapy,"" he said in a statement on the American Cancer Society website.\n\nThursday, Woodcock held out the possibility that Avastin might eventually prove helpful in a targeted group of patients. ""We certainly hope that additional data could be generated to see if there is a subset of tumors (that would respond more than others),"" she said. ""The FDA stands ready to work with Genentech on future studies.""\n\nSuch research is already underway, Arnold said, but it\'s too early to discuss the findings.\n\n""This is something Genentech is very committed to. Our scientists are dedicated to learning more about who might derive a greater benefit from Avastin,"" she explained.\n\nCNN Medical\'s Miriam Falco contributed to this report']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Overall we commend this story for navigating some tricky issues issue pretty squarely down the middle.

Inflammation throughout the body is accurately measured by high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a sensitive marker for future heart attacks and strokes. These results, published today online ahead of print in the American Journal of Medicine, with an accompanying editorial by the editor-in-chief, show that Plaque HD®, produced statistically significant reductions in dental plaque and inflammation throughout the body as measured by hs-CRP.\n\nIn this trial, all randomized subjects were given the same brushing protocol and received a 60-day supply of toothpaste containing either Plaque HD® or an identical non-plaque identifying placebo toothpaste. To assess dental plaque, all subjects utilized a fluorescein mouth rinse, and intraoral photographs were taken under black light imaging. For hs-CRP, levels were measured by an independent laboratory using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.\n\n""While the findings on reducing dental plaque extend a previous observation, the findings on decreasing inflammation are new and novel,"" said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., senior author and first Sir Richard Doll Professor, and senior academic advisor to the dean in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nLast month, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine ranked the original manuscript by Hennekens and colleagues on aspirin, inflammation and cardiovascular disease, published in 1997, as their most influential original report of the last 20 years. The original research from the landmark Physician\'s Health Study, in which Hennekens was the founding principal investigator, was the first to demonstrate that hs-CRP predicted future heart attacks and strokes.\n\nIn the accompanying editorial titled, ""Can a Toothpaste Reduce Heart Attacks and Strokes?,"" Joseph S. Alpert, M.D., an internationally renowned cardiologist, noted the importance and timeliness of these findings and commented on how his father, a dentist, had told him even before he went to medical school, that dental health may affect heart attacks and strokes.\n\nPlaque HD® is the first toothpaste that reveals plaque so that it can be removed with directed brushing. In addition, the product\'s proprietary formulation contains unique combinations and concentrations of cleaning agents that weaken the core of the plaque structure to help the subject visualize and more effectively remove the plaque.\n\nThis investigator initiated randomized trial was published in collaboration with academic collaborators from the University of Illinois at the Chicago School of Dentistry and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.\n\nBased on these findings, Hennekens and colleagues are drafting an investigator initiated research grant proposal to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the direction of co-author Patrick E. McBride, M.D., M.P.H., professor of medicine and interim associate dean for faculty affairs at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. This large scale randomized trial will test whether Plaque HD® reduces risks of heart attacks and strokes. The trial will be conducted in the Wisconsin Network for Health Research (WiNHR) and the Wisconsin Research and Education Network (WREN), both of which McBride directs.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognition Hennekens has received include the 2013 Fries Prize for Improving Health for his seminal contributions to the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease, the 2013 Presidential Award from his alma mater, Queens College, for his distinguished contributions to society, and the 2013 honoree of the American Heart Association, which he shared with FAU\'s College of Medicine for reducing premature deaths from heart attacks and strokes.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked Hennekens as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives.\n\nIn 2014, he received the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes. In 2016, he was ranked the No. 14 ""Top Scientist in the World"" with an H-index of 173.\n\n###\n\nAbout Florida Atlantic University:']","The university’s release plays up potential, but unproven benefits, while ignoring serious weaknesses in the research.","This news release about a small pilot study of a brand of toothpaste that displays plaque on teeth plays up potential, but unproven benefits, while ignoring serious weaknesses in the research. The release notes the study found people using Plaque HD toothpaste for a couple of months had less plaque and lower levels of a blood protein that is associated with a type of inflammation that may, in turn, be associated with heart disease risk in certain cases. But the release does not provide any hard numbers. It doesn’t mention that inflammation levels inexplicably rose in people using the placebo toothpaste, just one of many questions about the quality of the study and the meaning of its results.
Indeed, the researchers excluded more than a third of the trial participants from the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) test analysis (hs-CRP is a measure of inflammation that is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease risk), because their baseline results were already so low that they weren’t likely to see any further reduction. The release does not mention this important study design decision. The release does not tell readers that the study was paid for by the maker of the toothpaste brand. It does not mention other possible explanations for the results or the availability of other, much cheaper, products that also mark tooth plaque.

August 7, 2018 - Montmorency tart cherries may play a role in improving gut health, suggests a first-of-its kind human trial of nine adults combined with a parallel laboratory study published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. An international team of scientists found that Montmorency tart cherries helped to positively impact the gut microbiome - a collection of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in the intestinal tract.\n\nThe microbiome has been the focus of multiple studies in recent years due to its potential role in maintaining digestive health, as well as its impact on immunity, heart health, blood sugar control, weight management and even brain health. The gut microbiome holds great promise, especially related to personalized nutrition, although the research is still evolving and larger, long-term human intervention studies are needed. However, the new study does suggest that Montmorency tart cherries can be added to the list of gut-friendly foods.\n\nWhile previous studies on Montmorency tart cherries have ranged from heart health and exercise recovery to sleep, this is the first study to explore the potential gut health benefits. The researchers speculate that it may be due to the polyphenols (anthocyanins and other flavonoids) in Montmorency tart cherries, the varietal of tart cherries grown in the U.S. Polyphenols in plant-based foods are broken down by microbes to stimulate growth of good bacteria.\n\n""Montmorency tart cherries were a logical food to study due to their unique composition of polyphenols, including chlorogenic acids,"" said principal investigator Franck Carbonero, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Food Science at the University of Arkansas. ""Our results suggest that the unique polyphenol mixture in tart cherries may help positively shape the gut microbiome, which could potentially have far-reaching health implications.""\n\nResearch Methodology\n\nResearchers conducted both human and laboratory experiments to determine the impact of Montmorency tart cherries on the microbiome. In the human trial, nine healthy adults, 23-30 years old, drank 8 ounces of Montmorency tart cherry juice (from concentrate) daily for five days. These individuals were non-smokers and had not taken antibiotics (which can affect the microbiome) in the 12 weeks prior and during the study. Using stool samples, the participants\' microbiome was analyzed before and after the dietary intervention, and food frequency questionnaires were used to evaluate their overall diet.\n\nThe laboratory experiments were set up to mimic the conditions within the human digestive system, specifically the stomach, small intestine and three regions of the colon, to study how polyphenols are broken down and absorbed. This process of breakdown and absorption can have a significant impact on the body\'s ability to use the beneficial bioactive compounds in plant-based foods. The researchers tested U.S.-grown Montmorency tart cherries, European tart cherries, sweet cherries, apricots and isolated polyphenols in each simulated region of the digestive tract. They analyzed changes in the mix of bacteria and how these bacteria helped digest the polyphenols over time.\n\nStudy Results\n\nIn the human trial, the microbiome was positively altered (primarily measured by the increase in good bacteria) after just five days of drinking Montmorency tart cherry concentrate, although there were strikingly different responses due to the participants\' initial microbiome composition. Individuals who ate a more Western diet (low in fruits, vegetables and fiber) potentially had a lower ability to metabolize polyphenols, thereby reducing bioavailability and any potential health benefits in the tart cherries. Remarkably, in these subjects, instead of Bifidobacterium, Collinsella were the beneficial polyphenol-degrading bacteria stimulated. The individuals who ate a more plant-based diet, with higher intakes of carbohydrates and fiber, responded with an increase in Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, presumably because of the specific combination of polysaccharides and polyphenols.\n\nWhile more research is needed, these results suggest individuals consuming a more plant-based diet may have a mix of gut bacteria that responds more positively and/or rapidly to tart cherry consumption. Individuals consuming a more Western diet that is lower in carbohydrates and fiber may have a lower/different ability to metabolize polyphenols, thereby altering bioavailability and any potential health benefits.\n\nThe laboratory experiments found that pure polyphenols characteristics of tart cherries increased the amount of Bifidobacterium. However, when concentrated juices were fermented, this bifidogenic effect appeared to be leveled out by the larger increase of polysaccharides utilizing bacteria. Somewhat surprisingly, Carbonero said, chemistry analyses showed that tart cherries polyphenols were not completely converted to smaller phenolic metabolites, suggesting that the full diversity of bacterial species in the human gut is required for efficient breakdown of the polyphenols in tart cherries.\n\nWhile the dietary intervention was based on a limited number of human volunteers and more research is needed to support these conclusions, the results help build the foundation for future research and suggest Montmorency tart cherries can play a role in positively shaping the microbiome and maintaining gut health.\n\nMontmorency tart cherries are the most common variety of tart cherries grown in the U.S., and are available year-round in dried, frozen, canned, and juice forms - including juice concentrate, which was the form used in this human trial. Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate can be mixed with water or other juices. It can also be consumed straight from the bottle or used as an ingredient in recipes, such as smoothies and other beverages.\n\n###\n\nThis study was made available online in April 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication this month.\n\nSource:\n\nMayta-Apaza AC, Pottgen E, De Bodt J, et al.

The funders had no role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript. CMI\'s mission is to increase the demand for Montmorency tart cherries through promotion, market expansion, product development and research.']",This release reads like an advertisement with pseudo-science added for flavor.,"This tiny, industry-sponsored study of how the polyphenols found in Montmorency tart cherries might impact gut bacteria adds to a growing list of similar industry-sponsored studies investigating a wide range of possible health benefits of this domestic cherry.
This study did not show that Montmorency tart cherries may enhance gut health, and this news release did not even explain that there’s no scientific consensus on what defines “good” bacteria, “bad” bacteria, or a “healthy” gut.
The combination of unjustified language and lack of supportive data is a major weakness of this news release. Yes, the industry sponsorship and limited sample size (9 human subjects) is acknowledged, but other key limitations (lack of control group; reliance on subjects completing diet questionnaires) are not, and the end result is a news release with an arguably promotional tone.

McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.\n\nThe researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.\n\n“Smoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,” said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. “Finding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.”\n\nIn a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.\n\nIn the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.\n\nThe researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.\n\nInfants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.\n\nSumming up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present “a safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.”\n\nHowever, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. “Although vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,” she said.\n\nThis study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\nContact for Media\n\nTracy Brawly, OHSU Media Relations\n\nbrawley@ohsu.edu\n\nShare via Twitter\n\n“For mothers who smoke during pregnancy, vitamin C may reduce harm #smoking causes to their babies’ #lungs, finds new study of #vitaminC supplementation. #Nosmokingduringpregnancy.”\n\nFollow Us\n\nATS - @atscommunity\n\nAJRCCM - @ATSBlueEditor\n\nAbout the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine\n\nThe AJRCCM is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Thoracic Society.

But until now, information on the prognostic value of grip strength was limited, and mainly obtained from select high-income countries.\n\nThe current study followed 139691 adults aged between 35 and 70 years living in 17 countries from The Prospective Urban-Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study for an average (median) of four years. Grip strength was assessed using a handgrip dynamometer.\n\nThe findings show that every 5kg decline in grip strength [2] was associated with a 16% increased risk of death from any cause; a 17% greater risk of cardiovascular death; a 17% higher risk of non-cardiovascular mortality; and more modest increases in the risk of having a heart attack (7%) or a stroke (9%).\n\nThese associations persisted even after taking into account differences in other factors that can affect mortality or heart disease such as age, education level, employment status, physical activity level, and tobacco and alcohol use.\n\nA low grip strength was linked with higher death rates in people who develop cardiovascular (eg, heart attack or stroke) and non-cardiovascular diseases (eg, cancer), suggesting that muscle strength can predict the risk of death in people who develop a major illness.\n\nAccording to lead author Dr Darryl Leong from the Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, ""Grip strength could be an easy and inexpensive test to assess an individual\'s risk of death and cardiovascular disease.

Some experts think women should start getting them at age 40. Other think women should discuss the pros and cons of the test at 40, decide on an individual basis and start screens routinely at 50. Otto\'s study only looked at women aged 49 and older.\n\nOtto tracked 755 patients who died from breast cancer from 1995 to 2003 and another 3,739 control patients matched by age and other measures.\n\nAmong the women with breast cancer, nearly 30 percent of tumors were found at screening and about 34 percent between screens. Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.\n\nAdvanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.\n\nWomen who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.\n\nThe greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.\n\nThe study findings \'\'add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,"" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""This study focuses on survival.""\n\nThe study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted. It\'s not clear, for instance, whether the women who died of cancer got less aggressive treatment or refused treatment. That could have affected survival, of course.\n\nMammography does lead to \'\'overtreatment"" in some cases, Bernik acknowledged. Some cancers that are found on mammography may not have proven to be an issue in a woman\'s lifetime. ""But there is no way to figure out which cancers will be a problem or not,"" she said.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about mammograms, visit the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.']","Given the documented public confusion about mammography, any given story about a new study needs to provide more context than this one did.","This story summarizes results from a new Dutch study that finds women undergoing screening mammography reduce their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49%.   The article does a good job of briefly summarizing some of the debate around the age to begin screening and uses an outside expert who identifies some limitations of the study.

But early last year, the teenager began a type of immunotherapy, eating minute but gradually increasing amounts of milk protein. In March she tasted her first bite of ice cream, the same day she was accepted in the honors business program at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nTraditional immunotherapy, via allergy shots, is a century-old technique most commonly used to treat inhaled allergens — such as cat dander and pollen — and it’s also standard treatment for bee sting allergy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing immunotherapy to treat food allergies is rare and well outside mainstream practice. Cooper’s allergist, Dr. Richard L. Wasserman in Dallas, has treated fewer than 100 food allergy patients — and he knows of only two other physicians doing it in their practices.\n\nAt the same time, nearly 4% of children in the U.S. had food allergies in 2007, and that number is rising, according to a 2009 article in the journal Pediatrics. These kids and their parents would love to stop scrutinizing food labels and bringing their own meals to potluck suppers.\n\nBut many allergists say immunotherapy for food allergies outside of a research setting is irresponsible. About 20 such trials are now underway, according to the National Institutes of Health database at Clinicaltrials.gov, and that’s where such treatment should currently stay, these allergists say.\n\nThey point out that food-allergy immunotherapy is untested at best, potentially fatal at worst. And several top scientists researching food immunotherapy published an article in the July issue of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology that decried the treatment’s use in patients outside carefully controlled clinical trials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is nowhere near ready for prime time, nowhere near ready to go out to the local allergists,” says Dr. Robert Wood, one of the commentary’s authors and chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He worries that a food-sensitive patient will die from immunotherapy not performed with sufficient care.\n\nBasic allergy treatment\n\nForty million to 50 million Americans suffer from some sort of allergy, according to a recent report from Harvard Medical School. Most medications — nasal sprays, antihistamines and the like — only treat the symptoms, not the underlying sensitivity.\n\nThe only way to diminish allergy is through immunotherapy. Allergists typically provide injections, starting with a tiny bit of what bothers the patient and slowly ramping up to larger amounts.\n\nImmunotherapy does not exactly provide a “cure,” says Dr. Linda Cox, an allergist in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. But it can greatly reduce annoying symptoms. For example, she said, many people come to her practice because they can’t stand more than five minutes in a house with a cat. After immunotherapy, they frequently report they can spend the night in a feline-occupied home. That’s not to say they’re necessarily ready to adopt several kittens for their own abode; it just means they’ll need fewer tissues and less Benadryl when Fluffy is nearby.\n\n“Nothing works 100% on everybody,” says Dr. Michael Blaiss, an allergist at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. He estimates that 4 in 5 people who get allergy shots reap the benefit.\n\nOnly 5% of eligible allergy sufferers actually sign on for immunotherapy, Cox says, in part because it is quite inconvenient. People need shots weekly or more often — for weeks or months — to build up immunity. After that, doctors prescribe three or more years of maintenance shots, roughly monthly, to make sure the effects stick. Each shot requires a doctor’s visit, and patients must wait in the office for half an hour afterward to make sure they don’t have an adverse reaction.\n\nSoon, U.S. patients might be able to get the same therapy in a convenient, take-at-home pill. Recent clinical trials have shown a dissolvable, under-the-tongue tablet to be safe and effective. (See related story.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘Scared of food’\n\nPeople with food allergies have relatively few options. The only accepted method for coping with such an allergy is to avoid that particular food — no easy task when the allergen is as common as milk, wheat or the dreaded peanut.\n\n“You’re just constantly afraid; you’re scared of food in general,” says Toni Lacerte of Dallas. Her two daughters used to skip birthday cake and many other foods for fear of peanut contamination. After immunotherapy with Wasserman, fear of food is no longer a problem.\n\n“I really like not knowing what I’m eating,” says Lacerte’s daughter Taylor, 15.\n\nWasserman is among a few allergists bucking the mainstream by offering immunotherapy for food allergy. He presented some of his results this year at a meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in New Orleans. He has now completed the therapy on nearly 60 patients, he says, with 30 more in progress. After several months of treatment, he reports, many of those patients can tolerate one egg or a dozen peanuts.\n\nA victory against a food allergy is challenging because the allergens, such as peanuts, are particularly potent, Blaiss says — a tiny amount can kill.\n\n“The obstacle has been trying to do it without causing severe reactions,” Wood says, noting that in a five-subject study of peanut allergy shots more than 10 years ago, all patients suffered serious allergic reactions and one died.\n\nFor that reason, food allergy researchers have switched from attempting to use shots, which put the allergen directly into the bloodstream, to giving the allergen as a food or pill. The approach is much more promising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2008, Wood and colleagues reported on a study of milk allergy in which they gave 20 allergic children either a slowly escalating dose of milk protein or a placebo. By the end of the treatment, kids in the treatment group could comfortably consume, on average, more than 100 times more milk protein than those in the placebo group could handle. That study was published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.\n\nWood has also tried immunotherapy in children sensitive to eggs and peanuts, and some of those kids can now eat as much as they want of the formerly forbidden food. However, he noted, current studies are very small and not everyone gets good results. It remains unclear whether allergies will return in the future. Wood advises that, for now, children should receive this therapy only in a closely supervised research trial.\n\nParents “are going to need to be patient while all the details are worked out,” he says.\n\nFears on each side\n\nPatience is a hard sell for parents and children confronting a life-or-death situation with every menu. Waiting, in a sense, can be as risky as treatment.\n\nDelia Cagle, of Richardson, Texas, tears up as she recalls how her son Chad, now 8, had to sit by himself at lunch in kindergarten lest the egg products in other children’s food kill him. When he was quite small, he had a severe reaction after she cooked a casserole containing a bit of mayonnaise, even though she washed her hands before preparing Chad’s egg-free meal.\n\n“He turned blue and went limp in my arms,” Cagle recalls.\n\nTo end that fear, the Cagles chose to trust Wasserman and put Chad in immunotherapy.\n\nWasserman maintains that it’s better to actively treat food allergies than to simply hope that kids don’t encounter their allergen when far from home.\n\nDelia Cagle, for one, agrees. “I feel like it is so much safer,” she says of her son’s life post-treatment. She no longer fears Chad will die after an accidental brush with egg. In fact, he now eats two eggs every day to keep up his resistance.\n\nBut a dozen or so of Wasserman’s patients dropped out of the therapy — some because they didn’t like the food, and others because they had bad reactions. A few of those reactions, he reported at the New Orleans meeting, happened at home.\n\nThose reactions are what worry more mainstream allergists. They say there are no standards for the right dose of food allergen, the right way to select patients or how to carry out the treatment. According to Wood and the authors of the recent editorial, up to 18% of patients won’t be able to tolerate the side effects.\n\n“I’m real scared about putting peanut powder in children with peanut allergies,” says Blaiss, a past president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. “We just don’t know all the answers yet.”\n\nhealth@latimes.com']","This had the potential to be yet another ""miracle cure"" tale based on flimsy evidence and a few overheated anecdotes. Instead, it presented a balanced, nuanced look at a potentially important but uNPRoven technique for desensitizing individuals with life-threatening food allergies.","From the uncertainty of its opening headline to its thorough examination of concerns raised by national experts and local docs and their patients, this story nicely conveys the complexity that so often accompanies new medical research. A bit more detail in a few areas would have made this a five-star story.

The FDA reviewed and authorized for marketing the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator in fewer than 6 months as part of its Breakthrough Devices Program.\n\nMost patients with a suspected head injury are examined using a neurological scale, called the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale, followed by a computed tomography or CT scan of the head to detect brain tissue damage, or intracranial lesions, that may require treatment; however, a majority of patients evaluated for mTBI/concussion do not have detectable intracranial lesions after having a CT scan. Availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a CT scan in patients suspected of having mTBI and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients.\n\n“Helping to deliver innovative testing technologies that minimize health impacts to patients while still providing accurate and reliable results to inform appropriate evaluation and treatment is an FDA priority. Today’s action supports the FDA’s Initiative to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging—an effort to ensure that each patient is getting the right imaging exam, at the right time, with the right radiation dose,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “A blood-testing option for the evaluation of mTBI/concussion not only provides health care professionals with a new tool, but also sets the stage for a more modernized standard of care for testing of suspected cases. In addition, availability of a blood test for mTBI/concussion will likely reduce the CT scans performed on patients with concussion each year, potentially saving our health care system the cost of often unnecessary neuroimaging tests.”\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 there were approximately 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. Of these cases, TBI contributed to the deaths of nearly 50,000 people. TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brain’s normal functioning. Its severity may range from mild to severe, with 75 percent of TBIs that occur each year being assessed as mTBIs or concussions. A majority of patients with concussion symptoms have a negative CT scan. Potential effects of TBI can include impaired thinking or memory, movement, sensation or emotional functioning.\n\n“A blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the American public and for our Service Members abroad who need access to quick and accurate tests,” said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The FDA’s review team worked closely with the test developer and the U.S. Department of Defense to expedite a blood test for the evaluation of mTBI that can be used both in the continental U.S. as well as foreign U.S. laboratories that service the American military.”\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator works by measuring levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Levels of these blood proteins after mTBI/concussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which won’t. Being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a CT scan. Test results can be available within 3 to 4 hours.\n\nThe FDA evaluated data from a multi-center, prospective clinical study of 1,947 individual blood samples from adults with suspected mTBI/concussion and reviewed the product’s performance by comparing mTBI/concussion blood tests results with CT scan results. The Brain Trauma Indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan 97.5 percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a CT scan 99.6 percent of the time. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI.\n\nThe Brain Trauma Indicator was reviewed under the FDA’s De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device.\n\nThe FDA is permitting marketing of the Brain Trauma Indicator to Banyan Biomarkers, Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###\n\nInquiries Media: Tara Rabin 240-402-3157 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA\n\nRelated Information']",The actual cost implications of the new test are anything but clear based on this news release.,"The Food and Drug Administration approved for marketing a blood test that uses the presence of certain proteins to predict whether adults with a suspected concussion have structural brain injury, and which could conceivably reduce the number of people who undergo costlier computed tomography (CT) scans. The Brain Trauma Indicator test measures levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Its anticipated that knowing these levels can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which don’t.
We wish the release had included the research institutions involved and any publications relating to the study so that we could evaluate the evidence.
This evidence was also missing from a CNN story we also reviewed on the test.

""In addition to survival benefits, the study also recognizes other treatment effects of Entresto, particularly in reducing HF hospitalizations.1 Coupled with the recent Class I recommendation, the strongest endorsement, in the focused update to the US HF Guideline,2 these findings underscore the potential of Entresto as a standard therapy for chronic HFrEF patients.""\n\nIn a separate analysis published in the same issue of JAMA Cardiology, researchers used data from the PARADIGM-HF trial to model the health consequences and cost-effectiveness of Entresto over a 30-year time period.3 They compared Entresto to the ACE-inhibitor enalapril and found Entresto was associated with more than a year longer average survival time, and that it was cost-effective compared to enalapril when these medications were used with other standard of care therapies.3 For every 1,000 patients treated with Entresto vs. enalapril, potentially 59.7 HF hospital admissions could be averted per each year alive in the model.3 In addition, Entresto increased life expectancy at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio consistent with other high-value widely accepted cardiovascular interventions such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and cholesterol-lowering statins before they became generic.3\n\nAbout Heart Failure\n\nHeart failure is a debilitating and life-threatening condition, which impacts nearly 6 million Americans and is the leading cause of hospitalization among Americans over the age of 65.4,8 About half of people with heart failure have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).5 Reduced ejection fraction means the heart does not contract with enough force, so less blood is pumped out.9 Heart failure presents a major and growing health-economic burden that currently exceeds $30 billion in the United States, which accounts for both direct and indirect costs.10\n\nAbout Entresto\n\nEntresto is a twice-a-day medicine that reduces the strain on the failing heart. It does this by enhancing the protective neurohormonal systems (Natriuretic Peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).11 Other heart failure medicines only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS.12 Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril, and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan.11\n\nEntresto is indicated in the US to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.11 Entresto is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, in place of an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).11 Entresto film-coated tablets are available in three dosage strengths: 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg (sacubitril/valsartan).11 These doses are referred to as 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg in the clinical trial literature including the New England Journal of Medicine publication of the results of PARADIGM-HF. The target treatment dose of Entresto is 97/103 mg twice daily.11\n\nNovartis is committed to providing patients with affordable access and resources through Entresto Central.

Patients should talk to their doctor about other ways to treat heart failure if they plan to become pregnant. If a patient gets pregnant while taking Entresto, she should tell her doctor right away.\n\nPatients are not to take Entresto if they are allergic to sacubitril or valsartan or any of the ingredients in Entresto; have had an allergic reaction including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or trouble breathing while taking a type of medicine called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB); or take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto for at least 36 hours before or after they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients should talk with their doctor or pharmacist before taking Entresto if they are not sure if they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto if they have diabetes and take a medicine that contains aliskiren.\n\nBefore they take Entresto, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they have kidney or liver problems; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant; are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Patients should either take Entresto or breastfeed. They should not do both.\n\nPatients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. They should especially tell their doctor if they take potassium supplements or a salt substitute; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); lithium; or other medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems such as an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or aliskiren.\n\nEntresto may cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions causing swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat (angioedema) that may cause trouble breathing and death. Patients are to get emergency medical help right away if they have symptoms of angioedema or trouble breathing. Patients are not to take Entresto again if they have had angioedema while taking Entresto. People who are black or who have had angioedema may have a higher risk of having angioedema if they take Entresto. Entresto may cause low blood pressure (hypotension). Patients are to call their doctor if they become dizzy or lightheaded, or they develop extreme fatigue. Entresto may cause kidney problems or an increased amount of potassium in the blood.\n\nThe most common side effects were low blood pressure, high potassium, cough, dizziness, and kidney problems.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING available at http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/entresto.pdf.\n\nPatients are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

In the study published in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology, researchers created a statistical model that estimated that about 28,000 patients per year with heart failure and a lowered ejection fraction could benefit from Entresto, a twice-daily pill approved in 2015. The model found that patients on Entresto lived a year longer, on average, than those treated with enalapril, and that the medication was “cost effective” when used with concurrent standard therapies. The release from the drugmaker, Novartis, describes their complex analysis and highlights their conclusion that the heart failure medication is cost effective. But the release does not include any discussion of the extremely high cost of the drug.

So far, 15 patients have undergone the procedure -- two of them twice -- as the FDA monitors its safety.\n\nOne patient showed a remarkable improvement for a while, though U-M\'s Dr. Eva Feldman, who heads the research, cautions not to read too much into that. The other 14 showed no improvement.\n\nThe trail is tentative and early. But when the rest of a person\'s life has been compressed to an expectancy of two to five years, it is hope nonetheless.\n\nThe trial has been based in Atlanta since 2010, but U-M has requested approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to expand it and move it to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe trial involves injecting 500,000-1 million stem cells into the spine. The ancestry of the cells dates to the spinal cord of an aborted fetus in 2000. The cells are different from the embryonic stem cells that were the subject of a controversial ballot proposal in Michigan in 2008, when voters approved lifting the ban on embryonic stem cell research.\n\nFeldman and others theorize that these new cells act as nursemaids to damaged nerve cells, sending out repair signals, and somehow halting the progression of the disease.\n\nThe procedure worked in rats. It has been shown to be safe in pigs.\n\nIf the FDA approves moving the trial to Ann Arbor, Michigan patients will have access to an experimental treatment that not only might offer insight into a disease that kills an estimated 15 Americans a day, but also push back the battle lines against other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson\'s and Alzheimer\'s or Huntington\'s.\n\n""There is a lot of potential here,"" said Sue Burstein-Kahn, executive director of ALS of Michigan, a Southfield-based nonprofit.\n\nLast month, Feldman flew down with a team of U-M staff for the 17th surgery in the trial, in anticipation that the trial might soon move to Ann Arbor. The trial has been at Emory University in Atlanta since it began, in part, because Feldman wanted a former U-M neurosurgery resident, Dr. Nicholas Boulis, who is now at Emory, to perform the delicate procedure. Boulis collaborated with Feldman on her research for seven years during his residency.\n\nFeldman is clear and she repeats this often: This part of the trial tests safety only. By design, it doesn\'t\n\nassess the efficacy of the treatment yet.\n\nSo the clinical trial patients so far -- all from the Atlanta area -- know the experimental stem cell therapy probably will not cure them. Still, they\'re empowered, knowing their participation might one day cure others, said Ed Tessaro, a retired Macy\'s executive, from his home overlooking a sparkling Georgian lake.\n\nThe following morning, Tessaro, 66, lay on an operating room table at Emory\'s hospital, as doctors sliced through his skin and muscle, removed part of the bone in his spine and laid bare a pulsating, bright-white spinal cord for a second infusion of stem cells.\n\n""It may kill us,"" Tessaro said of the disease, ""but it\'s not going to defeat us before we die.""\n\nServing a greater purpose\n\nIt was 2008 when a single misstep and near-stumble during a half-marathon in Bangkok, Thailand, first worried Tessaro. It happened more than once. His muscles weakened, even as he stepped up his time at the gym.\n\nMonths later, a fresh, young doctor delivered the news to him and his wife, Judy.\n\nThey remember it well, even now.\n\n""She said, \'It\'s the worst thing I could tell you,\' "" Judy Tessaro recalled.\n\n"" \'You have ALS, and you have two to four years to live,\' "" Ed Tessaro added.\n\nThe doctor cried that day. So did Judy and Ed.\n\n""The dynamics are pretty grim -- fatal, no cure. Nobody has ever been cured. ... It takes a while to get your head wrapped around that kind of reality,"" Ed Tessaro said.\n\nBut Tessaro took stock. Life had been good, he decided.\n\nTessaro has been married for 43 years. He has a daughter and son and is a grandfather to two little girls. When he speaks of them, he can\'t help but grin. And the pictures in the downstairs rec room at the Tessaros\' home are of a thrill-filled life: ice-climbing in New Zealand, marveling at the lush green of Vietnamese rice paddies, being stunned by the chase-and-dart flurry of a cheetah taking down a Thomson\'s gazelle in the Serengeti.\n\nHiking. Biking. Skydiving.\n\nHe thought life couldn\'t be more vivid. He was wrong.\n\nNow, every conversation, every gentle touch from his wife, the babbling of his grandbabies -- his senses are now in hyperdrive.\n\n""In retrospect, I was living in analog. What I\'m now living my life in is high-definition. ... I\'m living my life fully, because I know I have less of it,"" Tessaro said.\n\nWhen he heard about the clinical trial, Tessaro jumped at it, calling it ""the larger-purpose stuff.""\n\n""It\'s not like I can hope for a miraculous reversal of this disease -- it\'s not coming,"" he said. ""I don\'t think I have anything to lose ... and I can be part of something bigger. It\'s great therapy when you commit yourself to something bigger.""\n\nHe became Patient No.12 on April 13. Doctors slipped stem cells into the lower -- or lumbar -- section of his spine. The area that controls lower body movement, it was considered least risky because Tessaro was already losing the strength in his legs anyway. Clinical trial protocol limits risk.\n\nTessaro survived. In fact, he left the hospital days earlier than expected and felt better sooner than he expected.\n\nSo doctors decided -- and the FDA approved -- a second, riskier, surgery for Tessaro. This time, doctors would move to the upper -- or cervical -- portion of Tessaro\'s spine, the area in which the nerves are responsible for breathing.\n\nFeldman calls this area ""precious real estate,"" the stretch of spine where researchers say they believe the treatment may be most effective.\n\n""Higher risk, but maybe higher reward,"" Tessaro said, shrugging. He was in the pre-operating room of Emory University Hospital, surrounded by family and overnight bags and medical tubes and equipment.\n\nIt was July 20.\n\nIn a stretch of hallway and an elevator ride away, a nondescript FedEx box was being delivered to Dr. Jonathan Glass, director of the ALS clinic at Emory. His hands were working quickly.\n\nPreparing for surgery\n\nGlass pulled from the temperature-controlled container several vials of the stem cells known as NSI-566RSC. They had been thawed to about 39 degrees and then shipped overnight to Emory by Neuralstem, a Rockville, Md.-based biomedical company that is funding the trial, according to CEO and President Richard Garr.\n\nThe company has shelled out about $2.5 million for the first phase of the trial and provided the stem cells, one of the company\'s premier products. They were drawn and cultured from the spine of an aborted fetus in 2000, then cultured again. They remain frozen until the day before they are ready for use.\n\nThey have arrived at Emory at 8 a.m. each surgery day of this trial -- ""never been late,"" said Jane Bordeau, a research nurse and coordinator for the trial at Emory.\n\nGlass separated out some of the liquid to test in separate vials, slipping some drops of blue liquid into the vials and tapping them lightly with a middle finger. He slid them onto a slide and rolled his chair to a microscope.\n\nDead cells will glow blue, he explained, having absorbed a dye that seeps inside their degrading membranes. Live cells remain clear and bright. At least 70% must be alive to be considered viable and to begin surgery, according to Neuralstem.\n\nGlass began counting.\n\nIn an upstairs operating room, a red second hand circled a wall clock.\n\nIn the pre-op room, Tessaro had been discussing the 25 videos he planned to make for his toddler-age grandchildren. He knows ALS will steal his voice. So he will travel to the Smoky Mountains, set up a tripod and record for them stories, like how he met their grandmother.\n\nHe talked about the two books in his overnight bags, too: Hemingway\'s ""Farewell to Arms,"" and -- he added, laughing -- ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" because his daughter dared him.\n\nNearby, his wife was quiet. She fidgeted with an overnight bag.\n\nIn his lab, Glass punched some buttons on his cell phone calculator.\n\n""It\'s cool,"" he announced. By his calculations, 83.6% of the cells had arrived alive.\n\nIt was time. The surgery would go as planned.\n\nSurprising the doctors\n\nTed Harada is on Page 8 of the March Journal of Stem Cells, which published the first study announcing the preliminary results of the first 12 patients.\n\nHarada is the anomaly. Patient No. 11. Like Tessaro did last month, Harada this month will undergo a second surgery. And like with Tessaro, it took some time to diagnose the mysterious weakening of Harada\'s body.\n\nThe former FedEx managing director, now 40, noticed he was getting winded in 2009 while playing Marco Polo in the family pool with his three children: ""I\'d go under water and come back up, and I was sucking for air.""\n\nAfter a string of doctors -- a family doctor, an orthopedist, a neurologist -- the final diagnosis came in August 2010: ALS. The diagnosis was devastating, but the timing couldn\'t have been better, the neurologist told him.\n\nClinical trial #NCT01348451 was under way.\n\nBy the time Harada, a self-described type A personality, went in for his surgery in March 2011, he was using a cane, unable to walk to the end of the driveway for the mail without losing his breath or to climb the 15 stairs to tuck his children in at night.\n\nHe saw the trial as a way to smirk at the disease, to become part of the solution that might one day beat it back for other patients, even if it didn\'t do a thing for him: ""I did the research, and I said to the doctors, \'Yeah, I\'ll be your guinea pig.\' ""\n\nTo his way of thinking, someone had to be the first man on the moon. Someone has to step up for medical research.\n\nPlus, he added, ""I know how the book ends if I do nothing.""\n\nBut what happened after his surgery wrote a chapter no one had expected.\n\nThe 14 other patients involved in the trial to date have shown no improvement; four have died -- three from complications of ALS, and the other from a heart-related issue, according to Neuralstem.\n\nIn contrast, Harada put aside his cane soon after the surgery. And he was again tucking his children into their beds.\n\nFeldman is insistent: Don\'t read too much into Harada\'s turnaround. The number of patients is tiny, and Ted is an oddity among them.\n\nStill, Harada\'s improvement, even if temporary, can\'t be ignored.\n\nThe researchers have used several tests to measure patients\' outcomes, such as breathing capacity, the strength of their handgrip, and even the electrical impulses that flow through their muscles. There on these graphs is Harada, his dotted lines suddenly shooting upward after surgery.\n\nIn designing the clinical trial, ""we were only aiming at stopping the disease,"" said Dr. Karl Johe, chairman and chief scientific officer of Neuralstem. ""But this is a patient that has clearly improved.""\n\nRecently, Harada has begun to get winded again climbing the steps to his children\'s bedrooms. He and wife, Michelle, 39, a sixth-grade teacher, have explained to their children that he probably won\'t get better this time.\n\nIn her worst moments, Michelle has foreseen graduations and Christmases and grandchildren without him.\n\nIn their kitchen, the Haradas\' children had just finished slathering peanut butter on bread and disappeared upstairs. A deeply religious couple, the Haradas said they\'ll take what they can get.\n\n""We\'ve been blessed,"" he said.\n\nMichelle Harada agreed, struggling against a surge of tears: ""The surgery gave us two years back.""\n\nPaving the way for others\n\nEd Tessaro was facedown, mostly draped in surgery blue in the crowded Emory operating room . It was 12:23 p.m. on July 20.\n\nA stainless steel, crane-like contraption had been screwed into the cervical section of his spine. A steady beep-beep-beep of the monitors punctuated the hiss of a respirator. A digital camera recorded every movement for the FDA.\n\nStanding just a few feet from Boulis, Glass was ready, with the spinal cord exposed.\n\nIt was 2:34 p.m. when Boulis asked for the cells.\n\nFor the next half hour, the vials were readied for the patented apparatus, on which an injection device slid along a guide to Tessaro\'s spinal cord. It would inject 100,000 cells for each of five stops precisely 4 millimeters apart.\n\nThe target was the ventral horn of the spinal cord, a tiny area associated with motor neurons.\n\n""Just looking at the spine can hurt it,"" Glass had said earlier.\n\nAt 3:06 p.m., the injection device slid into place. A needle extended, injecting deep into the spinal cord and, for two minutes, the stem cells were forced into the ventral horn.\n\nAt 3:29 p.m., the fifth and final injection began, and two minutes later, the relief was palpable. From her viewing spot just a few yards from Tessaro\'s neck, Feldman shifted on her feet and exhaled. The procedure, from start to finish, took a little more than six hours.\n\nTechnicians began to check recordings and run over the notes for the FDA. Boulis and the others began the process of removing the device and closing in the gaping hole in Tessaro\'s back.\n\n""Can we get some music in here?"" Boulis said.\n\nWhiz Khalifa\'s rap filled the OR.\n\nFeldman transferred the digital recording of the process to a memory stick she could review back at the office. A copy would go to the FDA, too.\n\nThere will be many more months of data, continued animal tests and most likely, hundreds of pages of reports.\n\nEven if this early stage is proved safe and the clinical trial continues, doctors must figure out whether these are the stem cells that work best in this therapy, and, if so, in what amounts and injected into which areas. There\'s the issue of the patients\' bodies rejecting these foreign bodies, too.\n\n""This is not a small molecule pill, and your patients go ... home and take the pill and you see them in your clinic in a few months,"" said Steve Perrin, CEO of ALS Therapy Development Institute, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit focused on finding a treatment or cure for ALS. ""These are the challenges this trial and this technology have in front of (them). They\'re paving the road, because no one has been down this way before.""\n\nOn Friday, Tessaro was recuperating at home.\n\nWaiting for any good news\n\nIn the Kleiss\' Royal Oak home these days, Riley the bassett hound has learned that her owner\'s lap is no longer hers.\n\nThe Kleisses continue to wait for any news they can on ALS -- possible cures, treatment, a clinical trial that could involve Regis -- ""anything,"" Mary Kleiss said.\n\nHer son\'s voice is gone, so his words are more carefully chosen these days. It\'s tedious work: A reflective dot on Regis Kleiss\' forehead strikes the digital keys on a laptop screen in front of him as he twitches and turns his head to manipulate the words. ""Y Me"" he wrote, in April:\n\n""It sucks to watch my body fai\n\nl.\n\n""While my mind n emotions r completely intact\n\n""Knowing full well the end result\n\n""And the road I\'ll be forced to walk\n\n""Becoming a prisoner in my own body\n\n""Watching my world fly by\n\n""Remembering how life used to be\n\n""Missing so much of life.""\n\nMore Details: FOR HELP, INFO\n\n• The ALS Association, based in Washington, advocates for ALS patients.

It provides a range of viewpoints on the treatments, gives cost information for the trial, and establishes the novelty of the technique.
But the story could have dug deeper into the question of what is causing the ALS that stem cells might help.  And that the limited response in only 1 of 15 patients could actually be due to something other than the stem cells.
In short, we would have liked to see more about the limitations of the evidence and about the tremendous mountain that needs to be climbed before patients are likely to benefit from new treatments from ALS.

This study, entitled ""Evaluation of a Predictive Algorithm that Detects Aberrant Use of Opioids in an Addiction Treatment Centre"", is published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Addiction Research and Therapy (Impact Factor: 1.4).\n\nDistinguished Fellow American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), Diplomate American Board of Addiction Medicine and Fellow American College of Preventive Medicine, J. Ramsay Farah, MD, MPH, MRO, CPE, led a research team that showed Proove Opioid Risk® identifies patients at risk for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) with nearly 97% accuracy. This study evaluated 186 patients, comparing 94 Medicaid patients at an addiction treatment facility with confirmed cases of opioid abuse, and 92 healthy patients with no history of opioid use. The receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.967. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the ""moderate risk"" cut-off score was 98%, while the specificity of the ""high risk"" score was 100%.\n\nDr. Farah, who serves as the Chief Medical Officer for the Phoenix Health Center in Hagerstown, prior NE Regional Medical Director for United Healthcare Clinical Services and Director ASAM explains, ""Based on ASAM\'s definition of addiction, about half of substance abuse is due to genetic factors. This study shows that analyzing genetics with lifestyle and behavioral variables in a predictive algorithm can accurately stratify patient risk.""\n\nDr. Ashley Brenton, Associate Director of R&D for Proove states, ""This validation study builds on the peer-reviewed evidence supporting Proove Opioid Risk® and its components as an optimal model to predict opioid abuse risk.""\n\nStudy author, Gregory A. Smith, M.D, former Director of Pain Management at Harbor UCLA, explains, ""Having used this technology for 6 years, this data provides further evidence that clinicians can use Proove Opioid Risk® for ruling out patients unlikely to exhibit aberrant behaviors, and identifying high-risk patients for alternative therapies.""\n\nProove Opioid Risk® is a proprietary precision medicine profile consisting of an algorithm which analyzes 17 variables (11 genetic and 6 lifestyle and behavioral factors) individually supported by over 30 peer-reviewed publications. Peer-reviewed clinical studies show that the Proove Opioid Risk® profile accurately identifies patient risk for opioid abuse.\n\nAbout Proove® Biosciences: Proove® Biosciences is the leader in precision medicine for the condition that lies at the nexus of health – pain. Proove® delivers precision medicine solutions for the nation\'s most prevalent and expensive health condition by investing heavily in research that has won awards from leading medical societies and been published in peer-reviewed journals.

A better comparator would have been people who used opioids for pain without becoming addicted.,"This news release from Proove Biosciences Inc. reports on a test designed to identify those at risk of becoming addicted to opioids so doctors can improve their prescribing practices. The release summarizes a study showing that the company’s algorithm, which combines genetic markers with lifestyle and behavior variables, accurately distinguishes between healthy patients with no history of opioid abuse and patients receiving opioid addiction treatment. The study, however, may be comparing people with opioid use disorder with the wrong control group, given that a more useful distinction would be between those who have become addicted and those who have used opioids in similar circumstances without becoming addicted.

The overall occurrence of pancreatic cancer has not significantly changed since 2002, but the mortality rate has increased annually from 2002 to 2011, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\n""Pancreatic cancer is really unique and different from other cancers,"" said study co-author Ka He, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington. ""The five-year survival rate is really low, so that makes prevention and identifying risk factors or predictors associated with pancreatic cancer very important.""\n\nPrevious studies have found that magnesium is inversely associated with the risk of diabetes, which is a risk factor of pancreatic cancer. But few studies have explored the direct association of magnesium with pancreatic cancer; of those that did, their findings were inconclusive, said Daniel Dibaba, a Ph.D. student at the School of Public Health-Bloomington, who led the IU study.\n\nUsing information from the VITamins and Lifestyle study, Dibaba and the other co-authors analyzed an enormous trove of data on over 66,000 men and women, ages 50 to 76, looking at the direct association between magnesium and pancreatic cancer and whether age, gender, body mass index, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use and magnesium supplementation play a role.\n\nOf those followed, 151 participants developed pancreatic cancer. The study found that every 100-milligrams-per-day decrease in magnesium intake was associated with a 24 percent increase in the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. The study also found that the effects of magnesium on pancreatic cancer did not appear to be modified by age, gender, body mass index or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, but was limited to those taking magnesium supplements either from a multivitamin or individual supplement.\n\n""For those at a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, adding a magnesium supplement to their diet may prove beneficial in preventing this disease,"" Dibaba said. ""While more study is needed, the general population should strive to get the daily recommendations of magnesium through diet, such as dark, leafy greens or nuts, to prevent any risk of pancreatic cancer.""\n\n###\n\nIn addition to He and Dibaba, other contributors included Pengcheng Xun, a faculty member in IU\'s Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics; Kuninobu Yokota of The Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo, Japan; and Emily White of the University of Washington in Seattle.']",This news release fails to mention any of the many key limitations of this type of study.

The aim of the study is to help ascertain whether supplements have any impact on reducing cancer risk. This news release focuses on the main findings which are overstated in the British Journal of Cancer article (shame on the editors of that journal for not asking the authors to state the limitations of the study more clearly). There are many limitations of this cohort study, including that there were relatively few cancer cases overall (151), that there were substantial baseline differences in smoking and alcohol use according to magnesium intake (two of the most clear risk factors for pancreatic cancer), and that when the statistical analysis excludes cases in the first 2 years of the study (those who may have already had a cancer growing), the findings became statistically non-significant. Moreover, the difference in absolute risk between groups was tiny. Somewhere along the line of this study’s journey from manuscript to news release, someone should have taken it upon themselves to scrutinize the findings more carefully and present a balanced report on the results.

Also, the longer patients used statin drugs, the greater their reduction in risk for colorectal cancer.\n\nThe findings are based on a review of 22 studies published through October 2009 and were presented at the American College of Gastroenterology\'s (ACG) 75th Annual Scientific meeting in San Antonio.\n\nStudy researcher N. Jewel Samadder, MD, MSc, from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, says the relationship between statin use and a reduction in risk for colorectal cancer was consistent across various study designs.\n\n“This effect was largely consistent across study design with both case control and cohort studies showing a strong correlation,” he says in a news release. “The length of statin use, both greater than six months and greater than five years of use was associated with reduction in colorectal cancer risk.”\n\nThe group of statins that showed the greatest effect in reducing risk are classified as lipophilic: atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Altocor, Altoprev, Mevacor), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor),\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the U.S.; 102,900 new cases of colon cancer are diagnosed in men and women every year, and about 39,670 new cases of rectal cancer are diagnosed annually.\n\nThe relationship between statins and cancer is unclear, but other research exploring the impact of statins at the molecular level suggests that these cholesterol-lowering drugs may help control the development of tumor, as well as tumor growth.\n\n“Observational studies have suggested that long-term use of statins is associated with reduced risk of several cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and liver,” says Samadder in the news release. “Our findings suggest that randomized controlled trials designed to test the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer are warranted.”\n\nThis study was presented at a medical conference.

At the same time, the women continued to be at a lower risk for breast cancer. That’s the good news.\n\nThe bad news is that there is no benefit of being less likely to develop heart disease, and any reduction in the risk of hip bone fractures evaporates with time, according to a report in the latest issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nFor years, women took estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin to help alleviate hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and in the belief that the drugs had a host of health benefits, including protecting their hearts. But the Women’s Health Initiative stunned doctors and women when researchers reported that the risks of the hormones outweighed any benefits. Hormone use plummetted, but women who had been using the drugs were left to wonder whether they were still at risk.\n\nIn the new analysis, researchers analyzed data collected from 7,645 women who were in the part of the study examining the effects of taking estrogen alone an average of 10.7 years, after the study was halted because of the evidence the drugs were harming women. The women had taken estrogen for about six years.\n\nThe researchers found that the risk for heart disease during the follow-up period was similar to that seen while the women were taking the hormone. But the increased risk for strokes and blood clots disappeared and the protective effect for breast cancer persisted. The protective effect for hip fractures disappeared. In fact, the women who took the hormone ended up being at somewhat higher risk for fractures.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Emily Jungheim and Graham Colditz of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis wrote that the findings indicate that while there “may still be a role for short-term use of unopposed estrogen for treating some women with menopausal symptoms ... this role may be vanishing as existing and emerging data continue to be better understood.”\n\nRowan Chlebowski, one of the researchers who worked on the analysis, stressed that the study only looked at women who were taking estrogen alone. Women who took a combination of estrogen and progestin face increased risk for breast cancer, previous studies have shown, Chlebowski said.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A 450-word Washington Post blog piece just didn’t stack up against a 1,200-word <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3796"" target=""_blank"">NY Times blog piece</a>.  </span>","In its brevity, this piece lacks that all-important context that more expert comment might have provided.

So women who took estrogen with progestin may think the results apply to them. Not until the last line is this crucial difference addressed.
Also, if there were risks or benefits, how big are they? There is no quantitative, and little qualitative information about the size of benefits and risks. In addition, some of the statements are misleading – see details below.

In the randomized controlled trial, 38 men with abdominal obesity followed a dietary pattern high in either carbohydrates or fat, of which about half was saturated. Fat mass in the abdominal region, liver and heart was measured with accurate analyses, along with a number of key risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\n\n""The very high intake of total and saturated fat did not increase the calculated risk of cardiovascular diseases,"" says professor and cardiologist Ottar Nygård who contributed to the study.\n\n""Participants on the very-high-fat diet also had substantial improvements in several important cardiometabolic risk factors, such as ectopic fat storage, blood pressure, blood lipids (triglycerides), insulin and blood sugar.""\n\nHigh quality food is healthier\n\nBoth groups had similar intakes of energy, proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, the food types were the same and varied mainly in quantity, and intake of added sugar was minimized.\n\n""We here looked at effects of total and saturated fat in the context of a healthy diet rich in fresh, lowly processed and nutritious foods, including high amounts of vegetables and rice instead of flour-based products,"" says PhD candidate Vivian Veum.\n\n""The fat sources were also lowly processed, mainly butter, cream and cold-pressed oils.""\n\nTotal energy intake was within the normal range. Even the participants who increased their energy intake during the study showed substantial reductions in fat stores and disease risk.\n\n""Our findings indicate that the overriding principle of a healthy diet is not the quantity of fat or carbohydrates, but the quality of the foods we eat,"" says PhD candidate Johnny Laupsa-Borge.\n\nSaturated fat increases the ""good"" cholesterol\n\nSaturated fat has been thought to promote cardiovascular diseases by raising the ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. But even with a higher fat intake in the FATFUNC study compared to most comparable studies, the authors found no significant increase in LDL cholesterol.\n\nRather, the ""good"" cholesterol increased only on the very-high-fat diet.\n\n""These results indicate that most healthy people probably tolerate a high intake of saturated fat well, as long as the fat quality is good and total energy intake is not too high. It may even be healthy,"" says Ottar Nygård.\n\n""Future studies should examine which people or patients may need to limit their intake of saturated fat,"" assistant professor Simon Nitter Dankel points out, who led the study together with the director of the laboratory clinics, professor Gunnar Mellgren, at Haukeland university hospital in Bergen, Norway.\n\n""But the alleged health risks of eating good-quality fats have been greatly exaggerated. It may be more important for public health to encourage reductions in processed flour-based products, highly processed fats and foods with added sugar,"" he says.\n\n###\n\nFacts: The FATFUNC-study']","Release calls reports on dangers of high fat diet “greatly exaggerated” but conclusions are based on a very small, short-term study.","A single, brief study from Norway claims to demonstrate that saturated fats are generally beneficial for most people, in contrast to much research that suggests potential heart risks are associated with higher saturated fat intake. The study of 38 men with abdominal obesity took place over a 12-week period and compared the effects of either a high carbohydrate or a high fat diet.
This study, though randomized, only measured markers of risk such as blood pressure and triglycerides (not actual heart disease) for a short period of time. Current recommendations regarding fat intake are based on actual rates of heart disease found in large groups of people followed for years.
It’s not unreasonable to raise questions about the role of saturated fat in heart disease. Researchers readily acknowledge that existing studies on the issue have important limitations. However, this release goes too far in describing the significance of this single small study, and gives no acknowledgment to evidence that cuts the other way. The release also lacks information expected of a solid account of a new nutrition study — such as a measurable benefit, harms, and details of the diet’s contents.

In Australia, it is the single leading cause of death in Australia, affecting 4.2 million Australians and killing one Australian every 12 minutes. Low-fat diets are often recommended as suitable food plans for those seeking to reduce their risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Similarly, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been shown to deliver significant health benefits.\n\nIn this UniSA study, published by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers compared the health benefits of a MedDiet supplemented with two to three serves of dairy each day, and a generic low-fat diet.\n\nThe results show that the dairy-supplemented MedDiet (MedDairy) significantly improved blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, mood and cognitive function.\n\nPhD candidate Alexandra Wade says the new MedDairy diet challenges popular perceptions of what is considered healthy.\n\n“The MedDiet is fast earning a reputation as the world’s healthiest diet and is renowned for delivering improved cardiovascular and cognitive health,” Wade says.\n\n“But it’s also higher in fat, which can be a deterrent for people seeking to adopt a healthier eating plan, especially if they don’t realise the difference between healthy and unhealthy fats.\n\n“In Australia, low-fat diets are often recommended for improving heart health and they are still perceived as being healthy.\n\n“This study shows that the new MedDairy works better than a generic low-fat diet, ensuring better health outcomes for people at risk of cardiovascular disease.”\n\nImportantly, the MedDairy diet also meets additional calcium requirements recommended by Australia’s national health bodies.\n\nA typical MedDiet includes extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, wholegrain breads, pastas and cereals, moderate consumption of fish and red wine, and low consumption of red meat, sweet and processed foods. It also includes 1-2 servings of dairy foods (700-820mg calcium), which is less than half the dairy recommended by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for older Australians.\n\n“Living in Australia, we have different dietary requirements, notably a need for more calcium to protect against osteoporosis,” Wade says.\n\n“These needs are unmet in the traditional MedDiet, which makes it difficult for people to adopt in the long term.\n\n“This study delivers healthier options for Australians by tailoring the nutrients in the MedDiet to meet the needs of a non-Mediterranean population.\n\n“In Australia, women up to age 50 years – and men up to age 70 years – should consume 1000mg per day of calcium per day and 1300mg thereafter, which is roughly between 3.5 and 4.5 serves a day.\n\n“The new MedDairy diet allows for three to four servings with dairy, which means Australians can more sustainably meet their recommended daily nutrient intakes while also maintaining the significant health benefits offered through the MedDiet.\n\n“When it comes down to it, people want to be able to enjoy a colourful, tasty and nutritious diet. And if you’re one of the thousands of people seeking to improve your cardiovascular and cognitive health – look no further than the MedDairy diet.”\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in Australia, with 43,477 deaths attributed to CVD in Australia in 2017.

It is also been reported that LAGB patients are likely to regain much of their lost weight years down the road.\n\nTo explore satisfaction levels and the long-term complication history of gastric banding, in 2009 Himpens and his team examined a pool of patients who had undergone the surgery between 1994 and 1997.\n\nThe results: 12 years or more later, more than 60 percent of the banding patients said they were ""satisfied"" with their experience. On average, excess weight loss had been maintained at a level approaching nearly 43 percent, and quality of life appeared to be equal to that of patients who had not undergone the surgery.\n\nHowever, 39 percent of the patients had experienced serious complications, including abnormal pouch expansion (9), band erosion (23) and band infection (1). Another 22 percent experienced relatively minor complications. Almost 50 percent had to have the bands entirely removed, while 60 percent needed to undergo subsequent surgery. The procedure ""appears to result in relatively poor long-term outcomes,"" the researchers concluded.\n\nOne in six of the patients ended up deciding to have a gastric bypass procedure, and all of these patients demonstrated good outcomes following their subsequent surgery.\n\nHimpens said that patients should limit their expectations with respect to banding, noting that ""all weight-loss operations have a high failure rate"". But he added that ""it is still defendable for surgeons to continue doing this.""\n\n""The high failure rate of the band gastroplasty [in] the long term is not that much worse than other procedures,"" he noted. ""[I] therefore think patients will continue to ask for the procedure.""\n\nBut he cautioned that patients undergoing band surgery should do so knowing that they need to commit themselves to rigorous long-term follow-up.\n\nMeanwhile, in a critique published alongside Himpens work, Dr. Clifford W. Deveney, a professor of surgery in the department of surgery at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, concluded that the current study does ""not shed a favorable light on the use of LAGB"".\n\n""The band has a spotty history,"" Deveney said. ""Some groups have very good results, with 60 to 70 percent weight loss. But other groups have either poor weight loss or complications, or both.""\n\n""So I think,"" he continued, ""that the patient should be made aware of these facts, and also that the weight loss is going to be less with the band than with a gastric bypass. And that it\'ll take longer to achieve the weight loss, because with gastric bypass most of the weight loss occurs over the first year, while with a band it takes five to six years.""\n\n""It\'s also easier to \'cheat\' on the band,"" he added. ""You can eat around the band and render it ineffective if you\'re not disciplined in following a healthy diet. With gastric bypass that\'s not as much of an issue. But all this is not to say that I think we shouldn\'t be doing bands. It\'s just not as good as bypass.""\n\nDr. Mitchell S. Roslin, chief of bariatric surgery at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said he was not surprised by the findings.\n\n""I always tell my patients that bands are like going a diet with a seatbelt,"" he said. ""And that there\'s bound to be a 5 percent extraction rate of these bands per year that they\'re in. Which actually comes to about the same percent of band removals these researchers observed among their patients.""\n\n""I think the problem with the bands is simply that having a fixed obstruction underneath your esophagus is not a natural occurrence,"" Roslin noted. ""And also these bands make it more difficult to eat, but they do not make every patient less hungry. So there\'s a big variability in treatment effect. You\'ll see patients who do great and patients who don\'t. Almost like a camel with two humps.""\n\n""So bands are easy to sell and very heavily marketed,"" he added. ""But for many patients, there are better options.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on gastric banding, visit the National Institutes of Health.']",A solid story that provides readers with good information about a very popular surgical procedure. We only wish it had taken a harder look at the underlying evidence and given readers some information on associated costs.,"This is a story reporting on a study detailing the long-term outcomes observed in a group of patients more than a decade after having gastric banding to help with weight management.  The story provided some useful insight about how gastric banding and gastric bypass compare in terms of rates and magnitude of weight loss.  It also informed readers about the fact that outcomes following banding surgery are highly variable.

Two phase III clinical trials show that a drug that restores the body\'s natural production of testosterone has no negative effect on a man\'s sperm count while a topical testosterone gel causes a significant drop. The findings, which are published in BJU International, could change the way men are treated for low testosterone.\n\nWhile testosterone replacement therapy can boost men\'s energy levels, sex drive, and mood, the treatment can fool the body into thinking that it is producing enough testosterone, so that it in turn starts making less of its own. This can result in a significant decrease in sperm count--leading to infertility--because the body needs its own testosterone to produce sperm.\n\nAn alternative approach to testosterone replacement is based on restoring the body\'s natural production of testosterone with drugs similar to those used to help women ovulate. Edward Kim, MD, urologist at the University of Tennessee Medical Center and Professor at the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine in Knoxville, and his colleagues compared such a drug, called Enclomiphene citrate, with testosterone replacement therapy (Androgel) in overweight men with low testosterone, or hypogonadism. In the randomized studies, 44 men started on 12.5 mg of oral enclomiphene citrate daily, with 25 men being up-titrated to 25 mg; 42 men received a topical 1.62 percent AndroGel; and 41 men received a placebo. Over five months, patients had 10 clinic visits with one overnight stay.\n\nThe investigators found that Enclomiphene citrate restored blood testosterone levels to normal after 16 weeks while maintaining sperm concentrations, whereas Androgel restored blood testosterone levels but caused marked reductions in sperm concentrations by suppressing the function of the testes.\n\n""One of the basic tenets in medicine is to do no harm. As this study has shown in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled manner, exogenous testosterone therapy with Androgel can clearly decrease sperm production and potentially impact fertility,"" said Dr. Kim. ""This study confirmed that Enclomiphene can maintain spermatogenesis while restoring testosterone levels to normal.""\n\n###\n\nFull citation: ""Oral Enclomiphene Citrate Raises Testosterone and Preserves Sperm Counts in Obese Hypogonadal Men, Unlike Topical Testosterone: Restoration Instead of Replacement.""

During an inflammatory response, immune cells flood the bloodstream with proteins known as cytokines.\n\nDrugs to counteract these cytokines are the newest generation of anti-inflammatories. Some are so new, clinical trials are still testing their efficacy and safety for human use.\n\nBased on previous findings about depression, the team looked at the side effects experienced by patients given anti-cytokine drugs in 20 separate studies. All the participants had chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases, which occur when healthy cells are mistaken for infected cells, causing the immune system to attack the body and leading to inflammation.\n\nRead More""]",Also: Neither the story nor the news release talked about the steep cost of this relatively new class of anti-inflammatories.,"CNN’s story about the potential future use of a type of anti-inflammatory drug to treat depression is based largely on research described in a news release issued by the University of Cambridge.
The story accurately reports serious interest by the principal investigator of the new research, and others, in tantalizing links between the immune system’s responsive  inflammatory chemicals–cytokines–and mental illness. In this case, the investigators accumulated evidence for the potential value of anti-cytokine therapy by focusing on anti-depressant effects of the drugs reported as side effects in a meta-analysis of 7 substantial clinical studies, mostly involving those with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The story quotes the principal investigator’s explanation for those links.
But unlike the study and the news release (which we also reviewed), it waits until the last two sentences to point out that the antidepressant effects of anti-cytokine drugs are at best “mild,” and essentially fails to point out that even if the new drugs were eventually proven safe and effective for depression, it’s likely that only a small subset of depressed people–those with chronic inflammation and resistant to current antidepressants–would find benefit over and above what other treatments already offer.
It’s worth noting that the news release did a better job of pointing out the limitations and side effects of any use of anti-cytokines in the future; and of making clear that randomized clinical trials are needed even to get near the point of using the drugs. Neither the news release nor the story, though, talked about the cost of this relatively new class of anti-inflammatories, some of which which are currently heavily advertised, but used to treat only severe cases of autoimmune disorders.

Normally used for contraception, the intrauterine system is sold under the brand name Mirena.\n\n""If women suffer with heavy periods and do not want to get pregnant -- as the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a contraceptive -- then having the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a very good first-line treatment option that does not require taking regular, daily oral medications,"" said the study\'s lead author, Dr. Janesh Gupta, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Birmingham and Birmingham Women\'s Hospital in England.\n\nFor women who do want to get pregnant, Gupta said, taking the blood-clotting drug tranexamic acid during periods is an alternate method of treating heavy periods.\n\nResults of the study, which was funded by the United Kingdom\'s National Institute of Health Research, appear in the Jan. 10 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHeavy menstrual bleeding is a significant problem for many women. About 20 percent of gynecologist office visits in the United States and the United Kingdom are because of heavy bleeding. There are several nonhormonal and hormonal treatment options available to reduce blood loss.\n\nThe current study compared the use of traditional medical options -- tranexamic acid pills, mefenamic acid (Ponstel), combined estrogen-progestogen and progesterone alone -- to the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned nearly 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding to receive either the IUD or standard medical care. They assessed improvement using a patient-reported score on a scale designed to measure severity of symptoms. The scale goes from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms. The researchers also asked about quality of life and sexual activity, and noted whether a woman needed surgery for heavy periods.\n\nWomen in the IUD group reported much greater improvement -- 32.7 points on the symptom scale versus 21.4 points in the standard treatment group. They also reported greater improvements in quality of life.\n\nThere was no difference in the rates of surgery or sexual activity between the two groups.\n\nMore women were still using the intrauterine system after two years than were still taking standard medical treatments -- 64 percent compared to 38 percent.\n\nGupta said the main reason she believes the IUD group was more successful at reducing symptoms is that there is ""100 percent compliance with treatment as there is a continuous drug treatment effect."" Women taking medications may forget to take them sometimes.\n\nSerious side effects were similar between the groups. Gupta said the main side effect from the intrauterine system is irregular periods for up to six months.\n\nAnother expert said the findings show promise for women bothered by heavy bleeding.\n\n""This study really adds to the evidence that shows how useful this intrauterine system is for heavy menstrual bleeding,"" said Dr. Eve Espey, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque.\n\nGetting an intrauterine system generally just requires one office visit, Espey said. Insertion of the device may be mildly uncomfortable for some women, she said.\n\nFor women who may be hesitant to use an IUD because of pelvic infections linked to an early version called the Dalkon Shield, Gupta said that as long as women are screened for sexually transmitted diseases before getting an intrauterine system, the risk of infection is low.\n\nEspey agreed.

The treatment has traditionally been used to treat bone and blood cancers.”\n\nBasil Sharrack, a consultant neurologist at Sheffield teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “The new treatment is showing some remarkable results in the small number of patients we have treated so far.\n\n“It is important to stress, however, that this treatment is only suitable for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis disease who have had two or more significant relapses in the past 12 months, failed to respond to standard drug treatment and who have had the illness for at least 10 years.”\n\nOne patient who has undergone the treatment, known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), told the BBC’s Panorama programme that he had made incredible progress.\n\nSteven Storey, who was diagnosed with MS in 2013, said: “I went from running marathons to needing 24-hour acute care. At one point, I couldn’t even hold a spoon and feed myself.”\n\nWithin a few days of the transplant, he was able to move his toes, and after four months could stand unaided, although he still needs a wheelchair. “It’s been incredible,” Storey said. “I was in a dire place, but now I can swim and cycle and I am determined to walk.”\n\nHolly Drewry was 21 when she was diagnosed with MS, and her condition deteriorated after she gave birth to her daughter, Isla. “Within a couple of months I got worse and worse,” she said. “I couldn’t dress or wash myself; I didn’t even have the strength to carry my daughter.”\n\nShe had needed a wheelchair before her transplant, but after the treatment she walked out of hospital. Drewry, whose MS is described by doctors as “dormant”, said: “It’s been a miracle. I got my life and my independence back and the future is bright again in terms of being a mum and doing everything with Isla.”\n\nTwo years after the treatment, she has had no relapses and there was no evidence of active disease on her scans.\n\nPaul Kirkham, another patient who has undergone the treatment at a cost of about £30,000, said: “It does knock you out. I’d rather have done 10 rounds with Mike Tyson.”\n\nRichard Burt of Northwestern University in Chicago, who carried out the first HSCT for MS in 1995 and is coordinating the international trials, told the BBC: “There has been resistance to this in the pharma[ceutical] and academic world. This is not a technology you can patent and we have achieved this without industry backing.”\n\nEmma Gray, the head of clinical trials at the MS Society, said: “Ongoing research suggests stem cell treatments such as HSCT could offer hope, and it’s clear that in the cases highlighted by Panorama, they’ve had a life-changing impact.\n\n“However, trials have found that while HSCT may be able to stabilise or improve disability in some people with MS, it may not be effective for all types of the condition.\n\n“We want people to be aware that HSCT is an aggressive treatment that comes with significant risks.

The superficial analysis of their results could lead to unrealistic expectations.,"An international clinical trial of a stem cell treatment for a common form of multiple sclerosis may be nearing completion, and several media outlets in the UK jumped on encouraging testimonials from some of the patient participants.  The BBC and The Guardian both issued stories on the same day reflecting much the same information, including interviews with the same patients and very similar quotes.  It is not clear why the story emerged at this point, as there is no indication that the trial is complete or that data from it have been analyzed.  And the same patients from the very same trial were featured prominently in a similar round of stories from 2013, many of which carried “miracle” headlines. Can these glowing testimonials stand the test of time?   If not, then the stories may have done a disservice to MS sufferers.

But some doctors believe even if that\'s the explanation for acupuncture\'s effectiveness, there\'s no reason not to offer it if it makes people feel better.\n\nThe new analysis examined 29 studies involving almost 18,000 adults. The researchers concluded that the needle remedy worked better than usual pain treatment and slightly better than fake acupuncture. That kind of analysis is not the strongest type of research, but the authors took extra steps including examining raw data from the original studies.\n\nThe results ""provide the most robust evidence to date that acupuncture is a reasonable referral option,"" wrote the authors, who include researchers with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and several universities in England and Germany.\n\nTheir study isn\'t proof, but it adds to evidence that acupuncture may benefit a range of conditions.\n\nThe new analysis was published online Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine. The federal government\'s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine paid for most of the study, along with a small grant from the Samueli Institute, a non-profit group that supports research on alternative healing.\n\nAcupuncture\'s use has become more mainstream. The military has used it to help treat pain from war wounds, and California recently passed legislation that would include acupuncture among treatments recommended for coverage under provisions of the nation\'s new health care law. That law requires insurance plans to cover certain categories of benefits starting in 2014. Deciding specifics is being left up to the states.\n\nSome private insurance plans already cover acupuncture; Medicare does not.\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture involves inserting long, very thin needles just beneath the skin\'s surface at specific points on the body to control pain or stress. Several weekly sessions are usually involved, typically costing about $60 to $100 per session. Fake acupuncture studied in research sometimes also uses needles, but on different areas of the body.\n\nScientists aren\'t sure what biological mechanism could explain how acupuncture might relieve pain, but the authors of the new study say the results suggest there\'s more involved than just a placebo effect.\n\nAcupuncture skeptic Dr. Stephen Barrett said the study results are dubious. The retired psychiatrist runs Quackwatch, a Web site on medical scams, and says studies of acupuncture often involve strict research conditions that don\'t mirror how the procedure is used in the real world.\n\nThe new analysis combined results from studies of patients with common types of chronic pain -- recurring headaches, arthritis or back, neck and shoulder. The studies had randomly assigned patients to acupuncture and either fake acupuncture or standard pain treatment including medication or physical therapy.\n\nThe authors explained their statistical findings by using a pain scale of 0 to 100: The patients\' average baseline pain measured 60; it dropped to 30 on average in those who got acupuncture, 35 in those who got fake acupuncture, and 43 in the usual treatment group.\n\nWhile the difference in results for real versus fake acupuncture was small, it suggests acupuncture could have more than a psychological effect, said lead author Andrew Vickers, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. The center offers acupuncture and other alternative therapies for cancer patients with hard-to-treat pain.\n\nThe analysis was more rigorous than most research based on pooling previous studies\' results, because the authors obtained original data from each study. That makes the conclusion more robust, said Dr. Andrew Avins, author of an Archives commentary and a physician and researcher with the University of California at San Francisco and Kaiser-Permanente.\n\nAcupuncture is relatively safe and uncertainty over how it works shouldn\'t stop doctors from offering it as an option for patients struggling with pain, Avins said.\n\n""Perhaps a more productive strategy at this point would be to provide whatever benefits we can for our patients, while we continue to explore more carefully all mechanisms of healing,"" he wrote.']",AP tops ,"In contrast with the competing Reuters coverage, this AP story explained how the study’s methodology differed from that of previous studies, and why the conclusions are likely to be stronger. It also featured comments from experts not involved with study and who are not professionally invested in the practice of acupuncture. Both stories would have done well to include a more careful description of harms. Granted, the meta-analysis in question did not look at harms, but the story could have provided some historical context nonetheless.

While the more aggressive treatment was better at preventing recurrence of tumors in the brain, it didn’t extend survival.\n\n“The potential benefits of whole brain radiation therapy are far outweighed by the detriments of the therapy itself,” said Paul Brown, professor of radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. The “negative impact” on cognitive function “was more than I would have expected.”\n\nDr. Brown is lead author of the study which was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The study involved 213 patients who had one to three small tumors, or metastases in the brain. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nBrain metastases is a common problem in cancer affecting an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 patients annually in the U.S. alone, some 200,000 of whom get whole brain radiation during the course of their disease. Lung cancer is the most common malignancy to spread to the brain, followed by breast cancer and melanoma.\n\nWhole brain radiation was first used in 1954 and has long been a standard strategy for brain metastases, said Andrew Lassman, chief of neuro-oncology at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. Though doctors have curbed its use in recent years amid concerns over its deleterious effect on cognitive function, whether the treatment or recurrence of metastases is worse for the patient has remained controversial, he said.\n\nWhole brain radiation is typically administered in 10 20-minute treatments given over two weeks while radiosurgery, in which radiation is delivered in a powerful, focused beam with instruments known by such names as the gammaknife, is a longer procedure given in a single day.\n\nFor the study, patients were randomly assigned to either radiosurgery followed by whole brain radiation or radiosurgery alone. Patients then underwent seven cognitive tests three months after treatment and at several subsequent intervals.\n\nPatients treated with both approaches performed significantly worse three months later on tests involving immediate recall of words, delayed recall and measures of verbal communication. Patients given both treatments also scored lower on a quality of life questionnaire, Dr. Brown said. Median overall survival was 7.5 months for those receiving both treatments and 10.7 months for those on radiosurgery alone, a result considered statistically about the same.\n\nThe study will “push the use of whole-brain radiation therapy more toward the latter portion of the patient’s course, when they have no more good viable options,” Dr. Brown said.\n\nThe new report is “the most comprehensive study that lets us quantify the risk/benefit” of the treatment, said Brian M. Alexander, a radiation oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston.\n\nDr Lassman said the findings conflict with some other studies. He said patients for whom brain metastases rather than their primary cancer pose the biggest threat to survival, for instance, may benefit from whole-brain radiation.\n\nDr. Lassman added that both whole brain radiation and recurrent metastases are “bad for the brain.”\n\nHe said researchers are studying alternate approaches, including irradiating the brain while shielding the hippocampus, a component of the brain critical to memory, and giving certain drugs used to treat dementia that may protect the brain against the effects of radiation.\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com']",Whole-brain radiation treatment can have side-effects — such as seizures and memory loss — that outweigh the potential survival benefits.,"
The story reports on a study that found the use of “whole-brain” radiation therapy in conjunction with targeted radiation therapy to treat cancer in the brain has more adverse side effects and no appreciable benefits over the use of targeted radiation therapy alone. The story does a good job of explaining the relevant treatments and placing the work in context. It reads clearly and gives readers an appreciation for the clinical treatment issues and concerns. However, there are areas where it could have been more informative — such as quantifying the results of the study and noting where it got some of its numbers regarding the prevalence of brain tumors.

""Now we find that these specialized stem cells could turn out to reverse problems associated with aging of the heart.""\n\nThe study was published today by the European Heart Journal.\n\nIn the study, investigators injected cardiosphere-derived cells, a specific type of stem cell, from newborn laboratory rats into the hearts of rats with an average age of 22 months, which is considered aged. Other laboratory rats from the same age group were assigned to receive placebo treatment, saline injections instead of stem cells. Both groups of aged rats were compared to a group of young rats with an average age of 4 months.\n\nBaseline heart function was measured in all rats, using echocardiograms, treadmill stress tests and blood analysis. The group of older rats underwent an additional round of testing one month after receiving cardiosphere-derived cells that came from young rats.\n\n""The way the cells work to reverse aging is fascinating,"" Marbán said. ""They secrete tiny vesicles that are chock-full of signaling molecules such as RNA and proteins. The vesicles from young cells appear to contain all the needed instructions to turn back the clock.""\n\nResults of those tests show lab rats that received the cardiosphere-derived cells:\n\nExperienced improved heart function\n\nDemonstrated longer heart cell telomeres, compound structures located at the ends of chromosomes that shrink with age\n\nImproved their exercise capacity by an average of approximately 20 percent\n\nRegrew hair faster than rats that didn\'t receive the cells\n\n""This study didn\'t measure whether receiving the cardiosphere-derived cells extended lifespans, so we have a lot more work to do,"" said Lilian Grigorian-Shamagian, MD, PhD, co-primary investigator and the first author of the study. ""We have much to study, including whether CDCs need to come from a young donor to have the same rejuvenating effects and whether the extracellular vesicles are able to reproduce all the rejuvenating effects we detect with CDCs.""\n\nSince Marbán\'s team completed the world\'s first cardiac stem cell infusion in 2009, the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute has made significant contributions to decoding and understanding how cardiac stem cells regenerate damaged heart muscle. The team is studying the use of stem cells to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a condition that affects more than 50 percent of all heart failure patients.\n\nGeneral support for Marbán\'s laboratory is provided by the National Institutes of Health. The CDCs, manufactured by Capricor Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) as their product CAP-1002, have been used in other human clinical trials.\n\nThe process to grow cardiac-derived stem cells was developed by Marbán when he was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University and further developed at Cedars-Sinai. Capricor has licensed the process from Johns Hopkins and from Cedars-Sinai for clinical and commercial development. Capricor has licensed additional intellectual property from Cedars-Sinai and the University of Rome. Cedars-Sinai and Marbán have financial interests in Capricor.\n\n###\n\nThe Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute is internationally recognized for outstanding heart care built on decades of innovation and leading edge research.

Publishing in the European Heart Journal, researchers concluded that cells from baby rats appeared to “rejuvenate” aged rats compared with a placebo. The news release brazenly speculates about potential benefits for humans without cautioning that findings from a rat study can’t be extrapolated to people. It also omits potential harms and costs.
To its credit, the release discloses the fact that Cedars-Sinai and a lead researcher have a financial interest in Capricor Therapeutics, which holds the license for the cardiac stem cell product, known as CAP-1002.

Larotrectinib is the first cancer drug to receive FDA breakthrough therapy designation for patients with a specific fusion of two genes in the cancer cell, no matter what cancer type. The research appears in The Lancet Oncology.\n\n""In some cancers, a part of the TRK gene has become attached to another gene, which is called a fusion. When this occurs, it leads to the TRK gene being turned on when it\'s not supposed to be and that causes the cells to grow uncontrollably. What\'s unique about the drug is it is very selective; it only blocks TRK receptors,"" said lead author Dr. Ted Laetsch, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and with the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nMore information\n\nLancet Oncology paper\n\nNews release on NEJM paper\n\nLarotrectinib, targets TRK fusions, which can occur in many types of cancer. While the TRK fusions occur in only a small percentage of common adult cancers, they occur frequently in some rare pediatric cancers, such as infantile fibrosarcoma, cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma, and papillary thyroid cancer, said Dr. Laetsch, who leads the Experimental Therapeutics Program (ETP) in the Pauline Allen Gill Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children\'s Health in Dallas.\n\n""Every patient with a TRK fusion-positive solid tumor treated on this study had their tumor shrink. The nearly universal response rate seen with larotrectinib is unprecedented,"" Dr. Laetsch said.\n\nAmong them was 13-year-old Briana Ayala of El Paso, who aspires to a career in fashion design. In 2016, Briana was found to have a rare tumor in her abdomen wrapped around her aorta, the largest artery in the body.\n\nSurgeons in her hometown said it would be too dangerous to operate, so her family brought Briana to Children\'s Health in Dallas, where UT Southwestern Professor of Surgery Dr. Stephen Megison had to remove portions of her aorta while removing most of the tumor.\n\nBut the cancer started to grow again and no further treatments were available.\n\nDr. Laetsch sent her tumor for genetic testing and found that Briana\'s cancer had the TRK fusion, meaning the new drug might help.\n\nBriana enrolled in the phase 1 clinical trial of larotrectinib and began taking the drug twice a day. Within weeks her pain and the swelling in her abdomen diminished, and scans showed her tumors had shrunk significantly.\n\nNearly two years later, Briana is back in school and playing with her dog, Goofy, and the family\'s seven parakeets. She\'s also been able to pick up her sketch pad and her dreams of a New York City fashion career.\n\n""These are the kind of amazing responses we\'ve seen with larotrectinib,"" said Dr. Laetsch, ""and this is why I\'m so excited about it.""\n\nThe results of the larotrectinib trial in adult patients - a 75 percent response rate - were published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe TRK-fusion mutation can be present in many types of cancers, including lung, colon, thyroid, and breast cancer, as well as certain pediatric tumors. TRK, short for tropomyosin receptor kinase, is a gene that plays a key role in brain and nervous system development and has a limited role in nervous system functions such as regulating pain in later life.\n\nLarotrectinib belongs to a class of molecules known as kinase inhibitors, which work by cutting back on the enzymatic activity of a key cellular reaction. The selectivity of the drug means it does not cause the severe side effects associated with many traditional cancer treatments, and none of the patients with TRK fusions had to quit the study because of a drug-induced side effect.\n\nEqually important, the response was long-lasting for most patients. ""For some of the targeted drugs in the past, many patients responded initially, but then resistance developed quickly. To date, the response to this drug seems to be durable in most patients,"" said Dr. Laetsch, who investigates the use of tumor molecular profiling to guide therapy in UT Southwestern\'s Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Division.\n\nA next step in the research is a clinical trial involving a similar drug for those patients who developed resistance. Dr. Laetsch will be the national leader for that clinical trial in children.\n\n###\n\nThe larotrectinib research was supported by Loxo Oncology Inc., the National Institutes of Health, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and Alex\'s Lemonade Stand Foundation. Dr. Laetsch is a paid consultant for Loxo Oncology Inc.\n\nThe Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center is the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in North Texas and among just 30 U.S. cancer research centers to be designated by the NCI as a National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site. UT Southwestern Medical Center is recognizing its 75th year this year.\n\nAbout UT Southwestern Medical Center\n\nUT Southwestern, one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation, integrates pioneering biomedical research with exceptional clinical care and education. The institution\'s faculty has received six Nobel Prizes, and includes 22 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 17 members of the National Academy of Medicine, and 14 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators.

UT Southwestern physicians provide care in about 80 specialties to more than 100,000 hospitalized patients, 600,000 emergency room cases, and oversee approximately 2.2 million outpatient visits a year.']",This was a safety trial involving only 17 patients so right out of the gate this news release misleads by claiming “effectiveness in 93 percent of pediatric patients tested.”,"This news release describes a phase 1 safety trial of a new cancer therapy undergoing testing for certain pediatric cancers. Rather than focusing on the safety and tolerability of the study — which is the purpose of a phase 1 trial — the news release takes a great leap by claiming success in treating patients, and in particular one patient who apparently had a positive tumor response — even though that was not the primary purpose of the trial.
The release needed to add some cautionary language that the drug is still in the early phases of testing, otherwise it could leave young patients and family members with false hopes. Overcoming a hurdle of bringing a potential new drug to market is worth announcing, but sponsors must take care not to mislead the public about how many hurdles remain.
The primary focus of this phase 1 trial was to demonstrate that the drug is safe and tolerable among pediatric patients. Instead of highlighting this finding, the news release emphasized that 93% of the patients achieved a response rate without explaining that this was a secondary endpoint observed among 15 patients. It went into further detail describing the dramatic improvement among one of the trial participants. Hopefully, these outcomes will be demonstrated in a wide number of patients over the course of further investigation. But this requires much larger sample sizes and follow-up time periods.

However, it can be considered a concrete option for patients showing aggressive MS who have not responded to approved treatments,"" said study co-author Dr. Riccardo Saccardi. He\'s from the cell therapy and transfusion medicine unit at Careggi University Hospital in Florence, Italy.\n\nUsing patients\' own stem cells to reboot the immune system is a way to halt the advance of the disease. But the treatment can be risky because the patient\'s immune system has to be wiped out before the stem cells are transplanted, the researchers said.\n\nIn fact, nearly 3 percent of the patients died shortly after receiving the transplant, and those deaths were directly related to the transplant, the researchers reported.\n\nThose deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening.\n\nIn effect, those patients gambled with a treatment that could be fatal for a disease that isn\'t, said Dr. Michael Racke, a professor in the department of neurology at Ohio State University.\n\nRacke pointed out that stem cell transplants were first used to treat deadly diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma and other cancers.\n\n""There may be a population of MS patients that could be identified that might do well with transplant,"" he said. ""It\'s important to select patients in such a way that they actually get well with the transplant.""\n\nA trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.\n\nMore than 2 million people in the world suffer from MS, in which the body attacks the central nervous system, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nMS can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis and blindness.\n\nThese symptoms can come and go, or persist and worsen over time. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as 2 and as old as 75 have developed the disease, the society says.\n\nMedications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there\'s no cure.\n\nTo see how patients did over the long term after stem cell transplants, Saccardi and colleagues followed 281 patients from 13 countries who received stem cell transplants between 1995 and 2006.\n\nThe researchers found that 46 percent of the patients experienced progression-free survival at five years after transplant.\n\nWithin 100 days of transplant, however, eight patients died (nearly 3 percent). Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.\n\nThe researchers think these deaths were most likely due to the transplant technology used before 2006, which has since improved.\n\nThe report was published online Feb. 20 in the journal JAMA Neurology.\n\nDr. Paul Wright is chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y.

But it would have been stronger if it had made it clearer that this was not an experimental trial–instead it was a data analysis looking at detailed medical records from people who had received stem cell transplants in the past.

Now scientists are mixing the good bugs into lotions in hopes of spreading protection.\n\nIn one early test, those customized creams guarded five patients with a kind of itchy eczema against risky bacteria that were gathering on their cracked skin, researchers reported Wednesday.\n\n“It’s boosting the body’s overall immune defenses,” said Dr. Richard Gallo, dermatology chairman at the University of California, San Diego, who is leading the work.\n\nEnd of the road for antibiotics?\n\nWe share our bodies with trillions of microbes that live on our skin, in our noses, in the gut. This community — what scientists call the microbiome — plays critical roles in whether we stay healthy or become more vulnerable to various diseases. Learning what makes a healthy microbiome is a huge field of research, and already scientists are altering gut bacteria to fight diarrhea-causing infections.\n\n\n\nWednesday’s research sheds new light on the skin’s microbiome — suggesting that one day it may be possible to restore the right balance of good bugs to treat skin disorders, too.\n\n\n\n“It’s a really important paper,” said Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who wasn’t involved with the new research. “It does open a window for a potential new treatment.”\n\nHealthy skin harbors a different mix of bacteria than skin damaged by disorders such as atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema. Those patches of dry, red, itchy skin are at increased risk of infections, particularly from a worrisome germ known as Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nGallo’s team took a closer look at how microbes in healthy skin might be keeping that bad staph in check.\n\nThey discovered certain strains of some protective bacteria secrete two “antimicrobial peptides,” a type of natural antibiotic. In lab tests and on the surface of animal skin, those substances could selectively kill Staph aureus, and even a drug-resistant strain known as MRSA, without killing neighboring bacteria like regular antibiotics do, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nBut those good bugs are rare in the skin of people with atopic dermatitis, Gallo said.\n\n“People with this type of eczema, for some reason that’s not quite known yet, have a lot of bacteria on the skin but it’s the wrong type of bacteria. They’re not producing the antimicrobials they need,” he explained.\n\nWould replenishing the good bugs help? “They’re normal skin bacteria, so we knew they would be safe,” Gallo noted.\n\nFDA fast-tracking ""unbelievable"" eczema drug\n\nHis team tested five volunteers with atopic dermatitis who had Staph aureus growing on their skin’s surface — what’s called colonization — but didn’t have an infection. Researchers culled some of the rare protective bacteria from the volunteers’ skin, grew a larger supply and mixed a dose into an over-the-counter moisturizer. Volunteers had the doctored lotion slathered onto one arm and regular moisturizer on the other.\n\nA day later, much of the staph on the treated arms was killed — and in two cases, it was wiped out — compared to the untreated arms, Gallo said.\n\n“We’re encouraged that we see the Staph aureus, which we know makes the disease worse, go away,” he said.\n\nThe study couldn’t address the bigger question of whether exposure to the right mix of protective bacteria might improve atopic dermatitis itself, cautioned Mount Sinai’s Guttman-Yassky.\n\nNext-step clinical trials are underway to start testing the effects of longer-term use.']","The trial was designed to test safety, yet the thrust of the story is about the skin cream’s potential to boost “the body’s overall immune defenses.”","This Associated Press story looks at results of a small clinical test using a skin cream that contains “friendly” bacteria to fight off potentially harmful bacteria, such as staph, in people with skin conditions like eczema.

During that time, 67 men had a stroke.\n\n“This study adds to the evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of stroke,” says researcher Jouni Karppi, PhD, of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. “The results support the recommendation that people get more than five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, which would likely lead to a major reduction in the number of strokes worldwide, according to previous research.”\n\nOther studies have shown that high lycopene levels may be linked to a reduced risk of certain cancers. Cooked tomatoes tend to have a greater effect on blood levels of lycopene than raw tomatoes or tomato juice. Tomatoes are not the only food that is rich in this antioxidant. Other sources include pink grapefruit, watermelon, and guava.']",This WebMD story made a key point that the competing ,"There was enough effort here to earn a 5-star score: plenty of original reporting and critical evaluation of the study.

Walnuts, that is.\n\nEating 2.5 ounces of walnuts a day -- a little more than half a cup -- for 12 weeks improved sperm quality in healthy young men, researchers report. Their study is part of a growing body of evidence that men’s dietary and lifestyle choices might affect their fertility.\n\nThe new study, funded in part by the California Walnut Commission, enrolled 117 men aged 21 to 35 who ate a typical Western diet.\n\nHalf the men were randomly assigned to eat 2.5 ounces of walnuts a day, along with their usual diet. The other men were told to continue their regular diet but not to eat any tree nuts.\n\nWalnuts are the only nuts with appreciable levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which some studies of male infertility have linked to better sperm quality, says researcher Wendie Robbins, PhD, of the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. Animal and human studies have shown that omega-3 fats and other polyunsaturated fatty acids “play critical roles in sperm maturation and membrane function,” Robbins’ team writes.\n\nPrevious research has shown that men with poor sperm counts saw improvement after taking fish oil supplements high in omega-3 fats, Robbins says. And a study of men attending a fertility clinic, published in May by the journal Human Reproduction, found that high intake of omega-3 fats was linked to more normal sperm size and shape, while high intake of saturated fats was related to lower sperm concentration.\n\nIn the new study, most of the walnut eaters snacked on the shelled whole nuts straight out of the package, Robbins says. Others mixed them with applesauce and cinnamon in a blender or chopped them up and added them to meatloaf, hamburger, and spaghetti sauce.\n\nBefore and after the experiment, the men’s semen quality was analyzed by a researcher who did not know which ones had eaten walnuts. The researcher looked at sperm concentration, vitality, ability to move, shape and size, and chromosome abnormalities, all thought to be related to fertility.']","Not unlike walnuts themselves, medical studies often come with a protective shell of claims that make their actual findings difficult to interpret.

REUTERS/Bayer/Handout\n\nThe findings will fuel an already intense debate about the merits of taking aspirin, which increases the risk of bleeding in the stomach to around one patient in every thousand per year.\n\nIn a study of eight trials involving 25,570 patients, researchers found that cancer deaths among those who took aspirin in doses as low as 75 milligrams a day were 21 percent lower during the studies and 34 percent lower after five years.\n\nAspirin protected people against gastrointestinal cancers the most, the study found, with rates of death from these cancers around 54 percent lower after five years among those who took aspirin compared to those who did not.\n\nPeter Rothwell of Britain’s Oxford University said that while taking aspirin carries a small risk of stomach bleeding, that risk was beginning to be “drowned out” by its benefits in reducing the risk of cancer and the risk of heart attacks.\n\n“Previous guidelines have rightly cautioned that in healthy middle-aged people the small risk of bleeding on aspirin partly offsets the benefit from prevention of strokes and heart attacks, but the reductions in deaths due to several common cancers will now alter this balance for many people,” he said.\n\nHis suggestion was that healthy people could start taking a small 75 mg dose of aspirin every day from the age of about 40 or 45 and continue doing so until they reached around 70 to 75, when the risk of the aspirin causing stomach bleeding rises.\n\n“REMARKABLE DRUG”\n\nAspirin, originally developed by Bayer, is a cheap over-the-counter drug used for pain and to reduce fever.\n\nPrevious studies have found taking aspirin can cut the risk of developing colon or bowel cancer and suggested it does so by blocking the enzyme cyclooxygenase2 which promotes inflammation and cell division and is found in high levels in tumors.\n\nAlastair Watson, professor of translational medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the study was an important step in scientists’ understanding of how to prevent cancer.\n\n“It is further proof that aspirin is, by a long way, the most amazing drug in the world,” he said.\n\nIn Rothwell’s study, published in The Lancet, researchers found the 20-year risk of death was reduced by about 10 percent for prostate cancer, 30 percent for lung cancer, 40 percent for colorectal or bowel cancer and 60 percent for oesophageal cancer in those taking aspirin.\n\nReductions in pancreas, stomach and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths.\n\nGeneric Aspirin pain medication pills are shown in the pharmacy of the J.W.C.H. safety-net clinic in the center of skid row in downtown Los Angeles, July 30, 2007. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThe researchers added, however, that treatment with aspirin during the trials lasted for only for between four and eight years on average, so the effects on risk of deaths due to cancer may underestimate possible results of longer-term treatment.\n\nPeter Elwood, an expert on aspirin from Cardiff University’s medical school who was not involved in this study, described aspirin as “a remarkable drug.”\n\n“This risk of a bleed is so small compared to the benefits,” he told reporters. “Yes, okay, it’s a tragedy if a person is rushed into hospital and given a transfusion (because of a stomach bleed) but in relation to the things we are preventing, that is trivial.”']","Sure, this story about the cancer prevention potential of aspirin includes quotes from independent experts, but they don’t add much when they are all singing from the same hymnal of aspirin praise.","This story presents only one view of a study of the effect of daily low-dose aspirin on cancer death rates: over-the-top enthusiasm and a single-minded group of experts. It leads with a suggestion that everyone over 40 should rely on aspirin to reduce their risk of dying from cancer and proceeds to pump up the potential benefits while almost sneering at any concerns about either the risk of bleeding caused by aspirin or questions about the way researchers took data collected from heart disease trials in order to reach conclusions about effects on cancer.

The weeklong conference is hosted by the\n\nAmericanSociety for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and The ObesitySociety (TOS).\n\nAllurionTechnologies, the manufacturer of the device called Elipse\uf0d4, whichis not yet commercially available, is studyingwhat it says is the “first procedureless gastric balloon” inpatients with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or more.\n\nThetreatment involves patients swallowing a capsule that quicklydissolves in the stomach to reveal a deflated gastric balloon inside.With a thin catheter attached to the device, but long enough toremain outside the patient’s mouth, a physician fills the balloonwith fluid (550 mL) to about the size of a grapefruit. The catheteris then removed, while the balloon remains in the stomach for fourmonths. At that point, a valve designed to open on its own, allowsthe balloon to empty and be excreted naturally from the body,eliminating the need for endoscopy or another procedure.\n\n“ Likeother gastric balloons, the mechanism of action of Elipse is likelymultifactorial and includes increased satiety from the reduction ofavailable space in the stomach, delayed gastric emptying, and changesin hormones that control hunger and appetite,” saidRam Chuttani, MD*, study co-author and director of Endoscopy andchief, Interventional Gastroenterology at Beth Israel DeaconessMedical Center in Boston. “Our findings demonstrate that Elipseprovides individuals and their caregivers with a safe, effective, andnon-invasive weight loss intervention that does not require surgery,endoscopy, or anesthesia.”\n\nResearcherspresented interim results for the first 34 patients of a multi-centerstudy that showed individuals lost an average of 22 pounds after fourmonths or 37 percent of their excess weight. Patients also sawimprovements in triglycerides and hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) levels,risk factors for heart disease and diabetes. Similar to othergastric balloons, the most common adverse events reported were nauseaand vomiting.\n\nNinhT. Nguyen, MD, immediate pastpresident of the ASMBS and vice-chair, UC Irvine Department ofSurgery and chief of gastrointestinal surgery, who was not involvedin the study said the device is not a permanent solution to weightloss, but has the potential to help those individuals who areoverweight or have obesity and are not candidates for bariatricsurgery.\n\n“ Newtreatment options are being studied and approved for the treatment ofobesity, which is good news for our patients and the healthcareprofessionals involved in their treatment,” said Dr. Nguyen, whowas not involved in the study. “For many struggling with theirweight, procedureless gastric balloon devices may serve as atreatment option that bridges the gap between weight-loss drugs andsurgery.”\n\nTheU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this year alone approved theOrbera\uf0e4Intragastric Balloon from Apollo Endosurgery and theReShape\uf0e4Integrated Dual Balloon System from ReShape Medical. Bothdevices are indicated for adults with BMIs between 30 and 40 whocould not lose weight through diet and exercise alone.

Maugh II, Los Angeles Times\n\n10:25 AM PST, November 14, 2010\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn implanted combination cardiac resynchronization device and defibrillator reduces deaths from mild heart failure by 29% compared with a defibrillator alone, researchers reported Sunday. The report is the second one indicating that such combination devices, which are about the size of a cellphone, can save the lives of many of the 6 million Americans with heart failure, and many surgeons are already using them for that purpose. About 70% of heart failure patients have the milder form of the disease for which the new study was conducted. The condition requires frequent hospitalizations and costs the U.S. healthcare system an estimated $40 billion per year, according to the American Heart Assn.\n\n\n\nHeart failure occurs when the muscles of the heart weaken and the ventricles fail to coordinate properly, or synchronize, reducing the ability of the organ to move blood throughout the body. In the most severe cases, patients become so weak that they are bedridden or suffer a variety of symptoms, such as shortness of breath, buildup of fluid in the lungs and other organs, confusion and fatigue. Patients with mild heart failure typically have few or no symptoms, but both groups have an equally high risk of atrial fibrillation (erratic heartbeats) or death.\n\n\n\nA defibrillator applies a small electrical shock to the heart to halt the erratic heartbeats and restore normal function. Cardiac resynchronization therapy delivers a regular, small electrical signal to the heart to maintain regular beating, increasing the ejection fraction -- the amount of blood pushed into the cardiovascular system with each beat. The device has leads going to both ventricles to ensure that they are synchronized.\n\n\n\nSuch devices are approved in the United States for treating patients with severe heart failure.\n\n\n\nLast year, U.S. researchers reported that a combination device manufactured by Boston Scientific reduced the death rate by 29% for patients with moderate heart failure in a study of about 1,800 patients. In September, the Food and Drug Administration gave the company approval to market the device for this indication.\n\n\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Anthony S. L. Tang of the Ottawa Heart Institute and his colleagues studied 1,798 mild heart failure patients at 24 centers in Canada, Australia, Europe and Turkey. About half were given an implantable defibrillator manufactured by Medtronic, Inc. of Minneapolis and half a combination device manufactured by the same company. The patients were followed for 40 months. Tang reported at a Chicago meeting of the American Heart Assn. and in a report published online in the New England Journal of Medicine that the team observed a 29% reduction in deaths in the patients treated with the combination device and a 27% reduction in deaths and heart failure-related hospitalizations. Fourteen patients had to be treated with the $35,000 device to prevent one death.\n\n\n\nComplications were about twice as common with the combination device, primarily because connecting the leads to the ventricles takes longer and requires a higher skill level. The extra leads also increase the possibility of infections.\n\n\n\nThe study ""gives us reason for renewed enthusiasm about heart failure treatment,"" said Dr. Clyde Yancy of the Baylor University Medical Center, the immediate past president of the American Heart Assn. ""There has been a dearth of significant trials [in mild heart failure] for some time.... What\'s good is that when we compare this to the other two studies, we see some consistency of response.""\n\n\n\nDr. Alfred Bove, a professor emeritus at Temple Medical School and an immediate past president of the American College of Cardiology, noted that many surgeons are already installing the devices in patients with mild heart failure and only connecting the defibrillators, ""not hooking up the second function until it is needed."" The new study, he said, ""supports the idea that doing this works.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story did not temper some of its optimistic projections with as much hard evidence as the story in the Wall Street Journal. </span>","Strong point:  use of the number needed to treat or NNT.

Dr. Tamim Hamid is the CEO and inventor of Theradome, a helmet that he said “uses 80 cold lasers to promote hair growth by stimulating the base of the hair follicle.”\n\nHe based his helmet off the findings of Endre Mester, a Hungarian physician who accidentally discovered that lasers can grow hair in mice in 1965.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\n“This has been sitting dormant for many, many years until about 2009. We discovered that the same wavelength of 678 nanometers was able to stimulate hair on humans as well,” Hamid told FoxNews.com.\n\nTo further explain how light grows hair Hamid said, “the laser light stimulates the mitochondria at the base of the hair follicle, which is where the stem cells that grow hair are located. Once the hair follicle is reactivated using light energy, the hair reverses the miniaturization process which was induced by the hormone DHT.”\n\nThe challenge that Hamid faced was putting this technology into something that was wearable and easy to use.\n\nBoard certified dermatologist Dr. Eric Schweiger who has not worked on Theradome, told FoxNews.com that there have been other products that use low level laser technology to grow hair, but Theradome is the first of its kind to be wearable. It doesn’t require anything from the patient apart from wearing the helmet for 20 minutes, two times a week.\n\n“The major benefit of therdome is you wear it as a cap and you don’t have to hold it up to your scalp. I think that will increase compliance,” Schweiger said.\n\nHamid said that Theradome has helped tens of thousands of people. One of those is Sabra Hardy who suffers from alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that left her with huge bald spots on either side of her head.\n\n“I was using creams that were developed for the coats of animals when they had problems with their coat. I was using oils developed for animals that were dangerous to use and smelled really bad,” Hardy said.\n\nHer hair loss was costly and painful. She spent hundreds of dollars on wigs and was getting steroid injections in her scalp for nearly two years with no signs of progress until she started using Theradome.\n\nAccording to the Theradome website, 97 percent of subjects saw positive results after 26 weeks of treatment and they reported a 20 percent increase in hair growth.\n\nSchweiger said that Theradome is safe for someone who wants another option in conjunction with other conventional baldness remedies, and that its effectiveness should be studied more over time.\n\n“For patients who are looking for an additional therapy it’s not unreasonable to use. I think we’ll know more as time goes on,” Schweiger said.\n\nAs far as the product’s safety, Schweiger said that since the lights are low energy and are not UV, he is confident that Theradome is safe.\n\nTheradome is FDA cleared and costs $895. Patients should always see their physician before trying any new treatments.']","Despite its 4-star score, this story failed to provide any critical analysis of the suspect claims made by the manufacturer of this baldness remedy.","This story describes a fairly new laser device that is said to promote hair growth. Although other laser products for this purpose exist, this is the first of its kind to be wearable. This may make it more likely that those with hair loss will continue using the device.
While the story does a fair job of addressing our criteria and includes reasonable comments from an independent expert, it falls short in several important areas and is only marginally satisfactory in others. For example, it fails to provide any critical analysis of the claim that 97% of study participants benefited from use of the product. The story also oversells the novelty of the device, and doesn’t mention several more established approaches that may be helpful for treating hair loss.

Photo: iStock\n\nA new generation of treatments for severe eczema is on the horizon, which doctors say could help millions more patients gain relief from chronic outbreaks of the oozing, itchy and sometimes debilitating rashes that come with the disease.\n\nAt least two new eczema medicines could be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017, and a half-dozen more drugs are being tested in clinical trials.\n\nAn ointment made by Anacor Pharmaceuticals and an injected drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi are designed to block specific proteins that cause inflammation. By targeting particular drivers of the disease, it’s believed the drugs cause fewer side effects than the steroid creams and pills that are the mainstay of treatment today.\n\nSteroids are blunt instruments that broadly suppress the body’s immune and inflammatory responses, doctors say. They carry the risk of long-term side effects, including thinning or weakening the skin, kidney damage and osteoporosis.\n\nThe Facts on Eczema Affects an estimated 7% to 10% of U.S. adults.\n\nSymptoms include dry and itchy patches of skin.\n\nCaused by a mix of genetic and environmental factors that cause hyperactive inflammation response.\n\nRecent advances include identification of molecules that drive the disease in some patients. Source: Jonathan Silverberg, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine\n\n“The treatments we have now are either not safe or not effective,” says Emma Guttman-Yassky, professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “The new drugs are more specific and therefore safer and potentially more effective.”\n\nEczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, affects roughly 12% of U.S. children and 7% to 10% of adults, according to some estimates. It is most common in children and often goes away on its own before adolescence. However, many adults also suffer from the disease, including an estimated 1.6 million with severe types that can have negative effects on their emotional and mental health, leading to bouts of depression or thoughts of suicide.\n\nThe exact causes of eczema aren’t fully understood, but most scientists agree that a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors cause the body’s inflammation response to overreact.\n\nIt’s long been thought the immune system plays a role in the disease, but only in the past five to 10 years has evidence emerged about the specific molecules that are most active.\n\nENLARGE Kelly Hayes of Chicago says she has benefited from the new drug dupilumab after years of suffering with eczema.

Elmariah, a dermatologist and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. “I think you’re going to see a revolution over the next 10 years in the number of treatments available.”\n\nRegeneron’s drug, dupilumab, targets two such molecules and in late-stage studies helped clear or nearly clear serious rashes in up to 38% of patients, or four times as many as patients taking placebo.\n\nThe FDA has designated dupilumab a “breakthrough therapy,” which is designed to help speed along promising new drugs to market. Regeneron and its partner, Sanofi, plan to submit dupilumab for FDA approval in the third quarter this year, which means it could be on the market as soon as 2017.\n\nAstraZeneca, AZN -0.23 % Eli Lilly and Roche Holding are some of the other drugmakers studying targeted eczema treatments in clinical studies.\n\nKelly Hayes, a 26-year-old project coordinator at a Chicago software company, has benefited from dupilumab. She has suffered for most of her life from eczema outbreaks that would nearly cover her body in rashes, open lesions and deep cuts. She spent hours each day caring for her skin, including nightly baths with salt, oatmeal and even small amounts of bleach to prevent staph infections.\n\nENLARGE Ms. Hayes’s cleared-up hand after dupilumab treatment. Photo: Alexandar Arsenijevic\n\nMs. Hayes says she often felt shunned by peers growing up because of her appearance. Some schoolmates feared her rashes were contagious and would refuse to have direct contact, she says. For a time, eczema “destroyed my self-esteem,” she says.\n\nLast year, Ms. Hayes entered a clinical study of Regeneron’s dupilumab. Within six months, her disease had gone from severe to moderate. Her skin became less red, she itched less and she had fewer rashes. Now, after a year and a half, her skin is almost entirely clear of the disease, Ms. Hayes says.\n\n“Emotionally, I feel awesome,” Ms. Hayes says. “It’s a big boost in confidence knowing that people aren’t going to freak out when they see you.”\n\nAnacor’s drug, called crisaborole, is an ointment aimed at treating children and adults with milder eczema. The drug works by blocking an enzyme known as PDE-4, which has long been known to cause inflammation. However, the only drugs that block the enzyme are pills that carry side effects including nausea and diarrhea and are considered too harsh for patients with mild disease.\n\nAnacor developed a treatment that can be applied directly to the skin and, because it doesn’t circulate throughout the body, avoids causing those serious side effects. It uses the element boron, which allows topical skin medications to better penetrate the skin and hit specific molecular targets like PDE-4, the company says.\n\nIn late-stage studies, roughly half of patients taking crisaborole had their diseases cleared or nearly cleared, a statistically significant improvement compared with 30% to 41% of patients using moisturizing placebos. The most common side effect was pain where the ointment was applied, experienced by about 4.4% of crisaborole patients and 1.2% of control-group patients.\n\nThe FDA is scheduled to decide whether to approve the drug by January. If approved, crisaborole would be the first new nonsteroidal treatment for eczema in more than a decade. Many doctors say they expect the drug to benefit patients whose diseases go undertreated because their fears about steroids cause them to use the drugs less frequently than prescribed.\n\n“We need a lot more nonsteroidal options, and [crisaborole] looks like it may be an important addition to our armamentarium,” says Jonathan Silverberg, a dermatologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “We have limited options for the thing we can safely give patients without worries about their long term use.”\n\nWrite to Joseph Walker at Joseph.Walker@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nEmma Guttman-Yassky\u200b is\u200b a \u200bprofessor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

So far, the drugs are faring well in clinical trials, and the companies behind them plan to seek FDA approval later this year.
This story is clear that availability of the drugs must await that approval, but the headline—New Eczema Treatments Could Be Available Soon—ignores the uncertainty surrounding FDA drug approvals. (We saw a similar level of excessive optimism in our review of a news release on a different drug: PR release on mid-stage eczema drug trial suggests benefit but doesn’t quantify.)

The Dundee University-based team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect prostate tumours. The method is non-invasive and cheaper than current detection techniques.\n\nProstate cancer has become the most common cancer in men in the UK. One in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than 47,000 new cases being diagnosed every year. Men aged 50 or over, men with a family history of prostate cancer, and black men are at greatest risk of developing the condition.\n\n“Current diagnosis of prostate cancer is extremely inefficient, leading to unnecessary treatments for many patients,” said the Dundee University team’s leader, Professor Ghulam Nabi. “Our new method is far more accurate and also allows us to identify the difference between cancerous and benign tissue in the prostate without the need for invasive surgery.”\n\nThe prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system and is normally about the shape and size of a walnut. Current methods for determining if a prostate has become cancerous include a physical examination of the prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE), MRI scans, a biopsy or tests to determine levels of the chemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stephen Fry, who has had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour, says he is excited by the new diagnostic test. Photograph: HGL/GC Images\n\nEach carries problems. PSA results can be unreliable; a DRE is not good at identifying which cancers are benign and which need treatment; MRI scans cannot always give a definitive answer; while a biopsy carries a risk of infection and is expensive.\n\nThe new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound. Cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue so shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour.\n\n“We have been able to show a stark difference in results between our technology and existing techniques such as MRI,” added Nabi. “The technique has picked up cancers which MRI did not reveal. We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs. This is a significant step forward.”\n\nThe trial tests involved around 200 patients. “Now we need to use this on a wider scale to build more data but there is clearly the potential to really change the way we manage prostate cancer,” Nabi said.\n\nSWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases. However, to make it applicable to prostate cancer a special probe had to be developed by the team.\n\n“The technique now needs to be tested in a much larger number of men to confirm just how well it can detect the aggressive cancers, while also ruling out those who do not have prostate cancer,” said Simon Grieveson, head of research funding at Prostate Cancer UK, which funded the Dundee project (with support from the Movember Foundation).\n\n“With an average of one man dying every 45 minutes from prostate cancer in the UK, the need for a more reliable test that can identify dangerous forms of the disease earlier is greater than ever.”\n\nTheresa May launches £75m drive against prostate cancer Read more\n\nIn the past few years, a number of celebrities have revealed that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have joined campaigns to raise awareness of the disease, including Michael Parkinson, Ian McKellen and most recently Stephen Fry, the comedian and former rector of Dundee University, who this year described how he had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour.\n\n“This breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the UK, not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence,” said Fry. “It is therefore doubly exciting to hear of the new techniques in diagnostic imaging.\n\n47,000\n\nNumber of cases of prostate cancer diagnosed every year in the UK\n\n11,000\n\nThe number of men who die each year from the disease\n\n1 in 8\n\nProportion of UK men who will get prostate cancer in their lifetime']",This story fails to provide anything more than hyperbole and unsubstantiated claims. Readers deserve more.,"This Guardian story touts a new approach for detecting and diagnosing prostate cancer which, it claims, is safer and more effective than the commonly used methods. The story states that researchers used up to 200 patients to gauge the efficacy of shear wave elastography (SWE) — an approach currently used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver disease.
Readers are left clueless as to what the research yielded, other than vague claims of SWE exceeding the value of other named approaches. The story fails to describe the research, to quantify the results, to mention costs or harms of this approach, or to offer any really independent comment on the work. Egregiously, it borrows heavily from a university news release.

These so-called ""hot spots"" are central to motor function, attention, facial recognition and social behavior -- types of behaviors that are abnormal in people with autism.\n\n""We know the two hemispheres must work together for many brain functions,"" study author Dr. Jeffrey S. Anderson, an assistant professor of radiology at the University of Utah, said in a news release. ""We used MRI to look at the strength of these connections from one side to the other in autism patients.""\n\nUsing MRI imaging, the team searched for differences in brain activity patterns in the microstructure of white matter tissue in 80 autism patients between the ages of 10 and 35. This tissue, the authors noted, is known to play a role in communication between various brain regions.\n\nCommunication deficits between the two hemispheres of the brain were, in fact, uncovered by MRI scans -- differences that the team said were not found in the brains of people without autism.\n\nThe authors also noted that apart from an increased brain size among children diagnosed with autism, there are no apparent structural differences between the brains of autistic patients and patients who are not autistic.\n\nAnderson and his colleagues, who reported no conflicts of interest, published their findings in the Oct. 15 online issue of Cerebral Cortex.\n\nInformation from this investigation will be pooled with those of another ongoing long-term study, which is tracking brain activity among an additional 100 autism patients.\n\n""We still don\'t know precisely what\'s going on in the brain in autism,"" co-author Dr. Janet Lainhart, an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics, acknowledged in the news release from Cerebral Cortex.\n\n""[But] this work adds an important piece of information to the autism puzzle,"" she said. ""It adds evidence of functional impairment in brain connectivity in autism and brings us a step closer to a better understanding of this disorder. When you understand it at a biological level, you can envision how the disorder develops, what are the factors that cause it, and how can we change it.""\n\nThe study was limited to high-functioning males and so did not allow researchers to generalize the findings to females, younger children, or ""lower functioning"" individuals with autism, the researchers wrote.\n\nFor her part, Laura Bono, the Durham, N.C.-based former chair of the National Autism Association and member of the board of directors of the autism advocacy group ""Safe Minds,"" expressed a certain amount of hesitancy about the prospects for MRI-driven diagnoses.\n\n""I\'m always glad to see there\'s more autism research underway, and there\'s certainly no risk to having an MRI,"" she said. ""But my question here is, \'Is there a real benefit?\'""\n\n""I would say that if this is geared to, or opens up, any specific avenue to targeted therapy that can help left and right brain communication among certain children for whom that\'s the pathway to autism, then it should certainly be explored,"" Bono said. ""But I do not see this as being about diagnosis, because we know that you\'re not going to screen 100 percent of children this way. Knowing that diagnosing autism is about looking for certain behaviors, only children already identified as having issues that might be a function of autism would be screened.""\n\n""So if there\'s no targeted treatment to follow up on the results of this kind of scan, then it\'s just another expensive test for parents who are already barraged with so many tests at diagnosis,"" she said. ""And in that case, I see this as just a waste of money.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on autism and diagnosis, visit the Autism Society.']",This story failed to give readers much helpful information on this very small study about the use of MRIs to detect physical brain defects in patients with autism. Read the full review to understand our criticism. ,"The story presents almost no information from the research study. We just know it was about MRIs in males with autism and that the researchers found something abnormal. We don’t know what the abnormal findings were, except they were related to how the hemispheres communicate. We don’t know whether the findings fit with a theory about the biology of autism or whether this was simply a fishing expedition. We don’t know how many of the 80 patients had the abnormality, if the MRI required special equipment or software, and if these were findings that any radiologist could detect. That’s simply too many gaps to make the story reliable.  Study authors’ comments came from a news release.  To its credit, the story did include cautious comments from one observer at the end. The challenge for this story is they are reporting on a basic science study, just one that happens to use MRI rather than bench techniques and one that was published in a specialized, technical journal.

CHECK UNUSUAL MOLES CHECK UNUSUAL MOLES An experimental immune therapy may provide a new way to fight advanced melanoma, a devastating cancer that often kills patients within six months. In a study of two novel treatments — a therapeutic vaccine called gp100 and an immune stimulator called ipilimumab — ipilimumab nearly doubled the number of patients surviving one year, found a study presented Saturday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology. About 25% of those given the vaccine lived one year, compared with 46% of those on ipilimumab. MELANOMA: Tanning bed link grows stronger Patients who received the vaccine lived a median of six months. Those given either ipilimumab alone or a combination of the two drugs lived about 10 months, according to the study of 670 patients, funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Medarex Inc., which developed ipilimumab. Doctors say that even modest success is reason for hope in this disease. Ipilimumab is the first drug to improve advanced melanoma patients\' survival in a large, definitive trial, says study author Steven O\'Day, director of melanoma research at the Angeles Clinic and Research Institute in Santa Monica, Calif. Ipilimumab works by harnessing the immune system\'s power to fight cancer, says Lynn Schuchter, chief of hematology and oncology at the University of Pennsylvania\'s Abramson Cancer Center, who has used the drug with her patients. The drug ""turns off the brakes"" on key disease fighters called T-cells, Schuchter says. But revving up the immune system can cause the body to attack healthy tissue, too, O\'Day says. In his study, those who got the most benefit from the drug were also the most likely to develop autoimmune problems. About two-thirds of patients developed side effects such as skin rashes, diarrhea, thyroid imbalances or hepatitis. Although most complications were manageable with medication, 10% to 15% of side effects were severe. About 1.5% of patients given ipilimumab died from the treatment, mostly because of intestinal perforations, O\'Day says. In comparison, ipilumumab seems relatively mild, says Matt Hershey, 43, of Lincoln University, Penn. Chemo made him nauseous and IL-2 left him barely conscious in the hospital for a week. But after two of four planned treatments with ipilimumab, Hershey says he is well enough to go to work every day. He used to run three to four miles a day. Now, jogging even one mile is difficult. But Hershey says his fatigue could be related to surgery and radiation to treat a brain metastasis, rather than ipilimumab. ""This doesn\'t even compare,"" Hershey says. ""For me to complain about fatigue now seems kind of silly."" Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, says he\'s especially encouraged about the findings, given that the last new therapy for metastatic melanoma, interleukin-2, was approved 12 years ago. Very little has made a dent in the cancer. ""Melanoma has been the place where research goes to die,"" he says, noting that some patient advocates had begun to dread the annual cancer meeting, knowing that they would most likely hear about another failed drug. As word leaked out of ipilimumab\'s promise, Turnham says melanoma patients and their families began clamoring for the drug. Still, Turnham cautions that patients shouldn\'t get their hopes up. ""I think we all know this isn\'t the answer, but maybe it points the way to an answer,"" Turnham says. ""I don\'t think we will find a single drug to fix melanoma. It\'s going to be a combination of drugs. Maybe we can find an immune therapy, a vaccine, and combine it with targeted therapies.. .. This is one time when there will be a little bit of good news.

The downside, some physicians say, is that it costs more and delivers twice as much radiation as traditional mammograms.\n\nTomosynthesis, or three-dimensional mammography, has been available in the U.S. since February from Hologic Inc., Bedford, Mass. In just a few months, radiologists say they are finding cancers they would have missed with the standard exam.\n\nOthers, though, urge caution. ""We really have to wait for the scientific evidence,"" says Barbara Monsees, who heads the American College of Radiology\'s breast-imaging commission, adding that the technology looks ""promising.""\n\nMany digital mammogram centers are increasingly offering the option of paying a supplement out of pocket for a 3-D image. Standard mammograms miss 5% to 15% of tumors, in part because small ones can be hidden behind tissue. We discuss with Robert Cascella, CEO of Hologic, which manufactures a 3-D mammography machine. Photo: Hologic.\n\nA study of some 25,000 women, now under way by an international team of researchers and partially funded by Hologic, is examining whether 3-D mammography finds more cancers. Preliminary results, presented at a scientific meeting in November, showed a 47% increase in cancer detection, but no conclusion can be drawn until the full results are published in a peer-reviewed journal, says Dr. Monsees.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends women get annual mammograms starting at 40 years old. A 3-D mammography machine is similar those used for standard 2-D mammography, but instead of taking just top and side pictures of each breast, the X-ray arm of a 3-D machine moves in an arc and collects detailed data used to create 50 or 60 razor-thin slices for each view. The 3-D scans show what breast tissue looks like at various depths.\n\nRadiologists say they can now see tumors that would have been obscured by surrounding tissue. ""I think we\'re going to find more cancers at an earlier stage"" says Liane Philpotts, chief of breast imaging at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., adding that one recent tumor, difficult to see on a standard exam, ""jumped right out at us"" on a 3-D scan.\n\nThe benefit is particularly noticeable in women with dense breasts, in which tumors can be hard to see, but the 3-D exam produces better results in all women, she says.\n\nThe new exam will likely save lives by finding cancers earlier and give women ""more options,"" such as skipping chemotherapy or getting a lighter dose, says Laurie Margolies, director of Breast Imaging at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. Dr. Margolies has briefly consulted for Hologic but has no continuing relationship with the company.\n\nIn addition to finding more tumors, early experience shows the 3-D exam may reduce anxiety-producing ""recalls,"" in which women are told to return for a diagnostic work-up after the mammogram looks unclear or concerning; recalls are mostly false alarms. In a 7,529-woman study at Yale University, the recall rate of women screened with 3-D and 2-D mammography combined was 6.6%, compared with 11.1% for 2-D alone.\n\nThe full exam typically includes a standard 2-D view as well as a 3-D one and has a patient under compression for a total of about 48 seconds, compared with 20 for a standard exam, Hologic says. Insurance often doesn\'t cover the 3-D portion so doctors say you often need to pay about $50 out of pocket. (The 2-D exam is done in part to aid in comparing results with earlier scans, Hologic says.)\n\nThe combination exam delivers 8.8 milligray of radiation per exam, around double what is given during a standard exam on Hologic 2-D machines, the company says. The double radiation dose could potentially cause cancer in 1 in 1,000 women who get 3-D mammography annually from age 40 until 80 instead of the standard exam, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe more-detailed exam will save lives overall over the 2-D scan if at least 3% more cancers are detected, which appears likely from preliminary data, says Peter Soltani, senior vice president of breast health at Hologic. He adds that small amounts of radiation from mammography have never been proven to cause cancer.\n\nHologic has applied to the FDA for approval to market a technology that would synthesize a 2-D image from detail taken in the 3-D sweep and which physicians say would significantly lower the radiation because you\'d only have to take one set of images instead of two. General Electric Co. is also applying to the FDA for permission to market a 3-D mammography machine; the company declined to say when it expects a decision.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com']",The headline asks a question that the story never adequately answers – and therein is one of the weaknesses of the story.,"A new 3-D mammography is now available, but without strong scientific evidence to support using this device, it is not clear whether the harms associated with it are worth the benefits or extra cost.

Newly published research in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition showed that a hearty bowl of instant oatmeal helped curb food intake at lunch better than a leading oat-based, cold cereal -- even when each bowl provided the same number of calories.\n\nThe statistically significant results of the randomized, controlled crossover study (n=47) showed that a 250-calorie instant oatmeal serving (with an additional 113 calories of skim milk) enhanced satiety and feelings of fullness, reduced the desire to eat and may even lead to a lower caloric intake at lunch, compared to a 250-calorie serving of cold, oat-based cereal, also served with an additional 113 calories of skim milk.\n\n""The satiety benefits of instant oatmeal alone were important findings,"" remarked lead author Candida Rebello, MS, RD, of Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. ""When we took it a step further and evaluated the intake four hours post-breakfast, we found that after consuming instant oatmeal, the participants chose to eat significantly less at lunch compared to those who ate the oat-based, cold cereal.""\n\nAfter an analysis of the types of fiber in each cereal, the researchers suspected that the higher molecular viscosity of the beta-glucan in the instant oatmeal contributed to its satiating effect over the oat-based, cold cereal. Authors stated that the processing of the cold cereal might lead to changes in the oat fiber that reduced its ability to enhance satiety.\n\nResearchers presented the participants with a lunch meal of their choice - turkey, ham, roast beef or vegetable patty sandwiches and a calorie-free or calorie-containing beverage, alongside potato crisps and cookies. The lunches offered ranged from 2,600 to 2,800 calories and participants were told to ""eat to satisfaction."" Total calorie intake was significantly lower following consumption of instant oatmeal compared to the cold cereal, as were fat and protein intake.

Currently only a post-mortem sampling of brain tissue can provide a definitive diagnosis. But the hope is that a technology that could be used in living patients could help rule out Alzheimer's in some patients and for those that have the disease, allow its symptoms to be treated more quickly. (The progress of the disease itself cannot be slowed.)\n\nThe general idea is to inject a compound into a patient containing molecules that bind to the amyloid plaques that are characteristic of Alzheimer's. Because the compound also contains a radioactive marker, it makes plaques visible on a PET scan.\n\nNow there's good news about one of the technologies the WSJ has written about, a compound called florbetapir developed by Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. A study abstract released at a meeting of Alzheimer's researchers shows a strong association between the results of those brain scans and the actual location of plaques determined after death, Bloomberg News reports.\n\nAnother study presented at the conference looked at people with mild cognitive impairment, which can precede Alzheimer's. It found that 22% of patients with plaques identified using florbetapir (vs. 3% of those without plaques) progressed to full-blown Alzheimer's within a year, Bloomberg reports.\n\nAvid's CEO told Bloomberg the company would apply for FDA approval of the compound this year. As the WSJ reported earlier, the Alzheimer's diagnostic and biomarker market is expected to reach $2.8 billion in 2014, up from $1.1 billion last year.

Each of the 25 patients enrolled in the study had two bad knees, but did not know which knee received the stem cells.\n\nGiven that the stem cell-treated knee was no better than the control-treated knee — both were significantly better than before the study began — the researchers say the stem cells’ effectiveness remains somewhat uninterpretable. They are only able to conclude the procedure is safe to undergo as an option for knee pain, but they cannot yet recommend it for routine arthritis care.\n\n“Our findings can be interpreted in ways that we now need to test — one of which is that bone marrow stem cell injection in one ailing knee can relieve pain in both affected knees in a systemic or whole-body fashion,” says the study’s lead author, Shane Shapiro, M.D., a Mayo Clinic orthopedic physician.\n\nJournalists, sound bites with Dr. Shane Shapiro are available in the downloads below.\n\nMEDIA CONTACT: Kevin Punsky, Mayo Clinic Public Affairs, 904-953-0746, punsky.kevin@mayo.edu\n\n“One hypothesis is that the stem cells we tested can home to areas of injury where they are needed, which makes sense, given that stem cells injected intravenously in cancer treatments end up in the patients’ bone marrow where they need to go,” he says. “This is just a theory that can explain our results, so it needs further testing.”\n\nAnother explanation is that merely injecting any substance into a knee offered relief from pain.\n\n“That could be, but both this idea and the notion that a placebo effect could be involved would be surprising, given that some patients are still doing very well years after their study treatment ended,” says Dr. Shapiro.\n\nHe adds that these findings are important because while use of a patient’s own stem cells for regenerative therapy is extraordinarily popular, the treatments may be untested and are often poorly regulated.\n\nStem cell clinics often offer expensive treatments for conditions that range from multiple sclerosis, lung and heart disease, to cosmetic treatments, such as facelifts. None of these techniques have been studied because clinics maintain that use of a patient’s own cells is not a drug.\n\nBut, depending on how they are processed and used, stem cells can, in fact, be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as biological products or drugs requiring rigorous safety and efficacy approval processes. In early September, the FDA held scientific meetings to clarify how to regulate such practices.\n\nMayo Clinic researchers developed their study with FDA approval.\n\n“We feel that if we are going to offer any stem cell procedures to our patients, the science needs to be worked out,” Dr. Shapiro says.\n\nThe study was conducted in Mayo’s Human Cell Therapy Lab. Researchers extracted 60 to 90 milliliters of bone marrow from each patient, then filtered it, removed all blood cells, and concentrated it down to 4 to 5 milliliters. The solution, which contained tens of thousands of stem cells, was injected into a patient’s knee using ultrasound-guided imagery.\n\n“We actually counted all of the stem cells with markers that are accepted by the FDA, and we made sure they would be able to survive inside the patient,” Dr. Shapiro says. “Counting is expensive. Most clinics just draw the cells from bone marrow or fat and inject them back into the patient without checking for stem cells, hoping that patients get better,” he says.\n\nDr. Shapiro and his colleagues are currently designing new studies that will test whether the stem cells home to distant areas of injuries, as well as exploring other implications suggested in their findings.\n\nStudy investigators include Mayo Clinic in Florida senior author Mary L. O’Connor, M.D., Shari E. Kazmerchak, Michael G. Heckman, and Abba C. Zubair, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. O’Connor is now at Yale University.\n\nFunding for this study was from Mayo Clinic’s Center for Regenerative Medicine.\n\n###\n\nAbout Mayo Clinic\n\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization committed to clinical practice, education and research, providing expert, whole-person care to everyone who needs healing.

So why tout the results as “dramatic” improvement?","This release from the Mayo Clinic describes the essentially negative results of a small, randomized and partly controlled trial of a widely used, but unproven treatment for arthritis. The treatment involves injecting a person’s own bone marrow containing pluripotent stem cells directly into arthritis-damaged knees. Popular in “regenerative medicine” clinics, Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate (BMAC) therapy, and a related therapy using Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) from blood, cost many thousands of dollars and are not covered by insurance.  BMAC therapy currently does not require FDA approval since many of its practitioners have argued successfully that harvesting cells from one’s own body and re-injecting them without complex processing does not constitute “a drug.” But neither has there been rigorous scientific testing for efficacy, adverse side effects, benefit compared with other treatments, and safety. The good news is that the Mayo Clinic study was designed to put some science behind a choice to use BMAC, which a few published articles conclude has helped many patients and for long periods of time.
The release notes that the study failed to make a scientific case that the therapy works to heal, cure or diminish osteoarthritic pain mainly because the 25 patients — each with two bad knees — served as their own controls for BMAC and it turns out that the “control” knees injected with plain saline benefited just as much as the stem cell treated knees.
Overall, the release uses weaselly language to give the stem cell treatment more benefit of the doubt than it deserves here, and devotes a lot of space making a case for the possibility that the injection of stem cells in one set of knees somehow “spread” systemically to the other knees. A meaningful discussion of harms and benefits are also missing.

According to a study published in Nature today, researchers discovered that these drugs may activate stem cells in the brain to stimulate myelin producing cells and repair white matter, which is damaged in multiple sclerosis. The study was partially funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSpecialized cells called oligodendrocytes lay down multiple layers of a fatty white substance known as myelin around axons, the long “wires” that connect brain cells. Myelin acts as an insulator and enables fast communication between brain cells. In multiple sclerosis there is breakdown of myelin and this deterioration leads to muscle weakness, numbness and problems with vision, coordination and balance.\n\n“To replace damaged cells, the scientific field has focused on direct transplantation of stem cell-derived tissues for regenerative medicine, and that approach is likely to provide enormous benefit down the road. We asked if we could find a faster and less invasive approach by using drugs to activate native nervous system stem cells and direct them to form new myelin. Our ultimate goal was to enhance the body’s ability to repair itself,” said Paul J. Tesar, Ph.D., associate professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, and senior author of the study.\n\nIt is unknown how myelin-producing cells are damaged, but research suggests they may be targeted by malfunctioning immune cells and that multiple sclerosis may start as an autoimmune disorder. Current therapies for multiple sclerosis include anti-inflammatory drugs, which help prevent the episodic relapses common in multiple sclerosis, but are less effective at preventing long-term disability. Scientists believe that therapies that promote myelin repair might improve neurologic disability in people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nAdult brains contain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which are stem cells that generate myelin-producing cells. OPCs are found to multiply in the brains of multiple sclerosis patients as if to respond to myelin damage, but for unknown reasons they are not effective in restoring white matter. In the current study, Dr. Tesar wanted to see if drugs already approved for other uses were able to stimulate OPCs to increase myelination.\n\nOPCs have been difficult to isolate and study, but Dr. Tesar and his colleagues, in collaboration with Robert Miller, Ph.D., professor at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., developed a novel method to investigate these cells in a petri dish. Using this technique, they were able to quickly test the effects of hundreds of drugs on the stem cells.\n\nThe compounds screened in this study were obtained from a drug library maintained by NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). All are approved for use in humans. NCATS and Dr. Tesar have an ongoing collaboration and plan to expand the library of drugs screened against OPCs in the near future to identify other promising compounds.\n\nDr. Tesar’s team found that two compounds in particular, miconazole (an antifungal) and clobetasol (a steroid), stimulated mouse and human OPCs into generating myelin-producing cells.\n\nNext, they examined whether the drugs, when injected into a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, could improve re-myelination. They found that both drugs were effective in activating OPCs to enhance myelination and reverse paralysis. As a result, almost all of the animals regained the use of their hind limbs. They also found that the drugs acted through two very different molecular mechanisms.\n\n“The ability to activate white matter cells in the brain, as shown in this study, opens up an exciting new avenue of therapy development for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis,” said Ursula Utz, Ph.D., program director at the NINDS.\n\nDr. Tesar and his colleagues caution that more research is needed before miconazole and clobetasol can be tested in multiple sclerosis clinical trials. They are currently approved for use as creams or powders on the surfaces of the body but their safety administered in other forms, such as injections, in humans is unknown.\n\n“Off-label use of the current forms of these drugs is more likely to increase other health concerns than alleviate multiple sclerosis symptoms. We are working tirelessly to ready a safe and effective drug for clinical use,” Dr. Tesar said.\n\nThis work was supported by the NINDS (NS085246, NS030800, NS026543), the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Myelin Repair Foundation, New York City.\n\nThe NINDS is the nation’s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.\n\nThe National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences is a distinctly different entity in the research ecosystem. Rather than targeting a particular disease or fundamental science, NCATS focuses on what is common across diseases and the translational process. The Center emphasizes innovation and deliverables, relying on the power of data and new technologies to develop, demonstrate and disseminate advancements in translational science that bring about tangible improvements in human health.

We agreed that the release waits far too long to warn readers that this exciting study of potential multiple sclerosis drugs was conducted in petri dishes and mice. One has to read through more than half of the release before that crucial caveat is introduced. But we had mixed opinions about the headline, “Drugs that activate brain stem cells may reverse multiple sclerosis.” Some of us felt this was misleading because readers would assume the release is talking about human disease, and there’s nothing in the release or the underlying study to support a “reversal” of disease in humans. The opposing view is that the headline accurately reflects what happened in the study in mice and is therefore not an exaggeration. According to this view, the release is deficient mainly because it failed to qualify that the findings were from mice in a timely manner (ideally the first paragraph), but not because of the headline. We welcome reader perspectives on this debate in the comments.

The headline–“Get active, beat lymphoma?”–is misleading. Even if the study could prove cause and effect (it couldn’t), it didn’t show that exercise “beat” lymphoma.
The story was problematic on several more fronts; all may stem from the fact that the news story appears to be derived nearly entirely from a related news release, and includes some of the misleading information found there. This is a worrisome trend we highlighted on our blog last month.

Some days the pain is so bad, she says, ""By 11 o\'clock in the morning, I\'m on the couch in a darkened room with my head packed in ice.""\n\n""I\'ve had two spinal taps; I\'ve had so many nerve blocks I\'ve lost count.""\n\nOver the years, Bradford, who is 50 years old and lives in Bedford, Mass., has searched desperately for pain relief. She\'s been to the doctor countless times for countless tests. ""Everything I\'ve had, I\'ve had twice,"" she says. ""I\'ve had two spinal taps; I\'ve had so many nerve blocks I\'ve lost count.""\n\nBradford is not alone. It\'s estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. Nearly one quarter of the population suffers from recurrent severe tension headaches or migraines.\n\nPeople who go to the doctor for headaches are increasingly likely to be sent for advanced testing and treatment, a study finds. That testing is expensive, it may not be necessary and it could even be harmful, says lead researcher Dr. John Mafi, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nMafi looked at the rates of advanced imaging like CT scans and MRIs in people with headaches, as well as referrals to other doctors, presumably specialists. He found that from 1999 to 2010, the number of diagnostic tests rose from 6.7 percent of all doctor visits to 13.9 percent. At the same time, referrals to other doctors increased from 6.9 percent to 13.2 percent. In other words, almost double what it was a decade ago.\n\nMafi says this isn\'t because more people are suffering headaches. The headache rate has remained virtually the same over the past decade. But what has changed is supply and demand. Today there are a lot more advanced diagnostic machines than there were a decade ago, and more patients are asking to be tested.\n\n""There\'s a subconscious perception that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.""\n\n""Patients are more assertive than ever before,"" Mafi says. ""They do research online, are more informed and sometimes go to the doctor demanding, \'I think I need an MRI.\' ""\n\nAnd while an informed patient is a good thing, Mafi says sometimes the patient gets it wrong. ""I think there\'s a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.""\n\nMafi\'s study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches. He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. And in these cases, repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies.\n\nOn top of that, exposure to radiation in tests like CT scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers.\n\nFor Terri Bradford, the years of searching for effective treatment proved futile. ""I\'ve been to four neurologists. A lot of them have given up on me because I haven\'t gotten any better,"" she says.\n\nEventually Bradford ended up at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where neurologist Carolyn Bernstein directs the Comprehensive Headache Center. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. ""The majority of them have really been suffering a number of years and they\'re really miserable with the pain,"" Bernstein says. They say, "" \'I hope you have a magic pill,\' and of course there is no magic pill.""\n\nThere is just no single reason why people get chronic headaches, although we do know that migraines have a genetic component and usually a trigger. ""If you are a migraine sufferer and I expose you to the right trigger, you\'re going to have a migraine,"" Bernstein says.\n\nBut the triggers are different for different people. They can include poor diet, too much sugar or certain types of alcohol. Problems sleeping, stress, lack of exercise or a combination of any number of these things can cause chronic headaches.\n\nAt the headache center, patients receive a thorough medical history that includes headache patterns, disability and mood assessments. Then the center works with patients to try to identify what triggers their headaches and how they can avoid those triggers in the future.\n\nSome people find relief through exercise. ""I write an exercise prescription probably as often as I write a prescription for medication,"" Bernstein says. She acknowledges it\'s sometimes difficult to encourage a patient with cracking head pain to get up and exercise. But even a little can help, and according to Bernstein it doesn\'t have to be jogging for miles and miles. It can be yoga, tai chi or even just a little stretching.\n\nA big lifestyle adjustment worked for Terri Bradford. She started exercising and changed her diet, giving up gluten, dairy and sugar. And she learned how to meditate to reduce stress. All these changes, she says, have made a huge difference. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they\'re far less severe. ""I\'m finally healing,"" she says.']","This story says there is no “magic pill” for migraines, and yet it offers something of a magic pill in the headline by saying that lifestyle changes can relieve symptoms. Maybe it’s true, but there is no evidence presented to back up the assertion.","
There are many bold statements made in this story about the single patient that is the focus of the piece and about the efficacy of different treatments for migraines. Yet no evidence is analyzed or presented to back up these claims. The person with severe migraines is presented here as a pitiable character experiencing extreme pain and resistant to all efforts at treatment. She eventually finds help through dietary changes and exercise, but we’re not offered any proof, beyond the story’s assurance and an expert’s opinion, that such changes have been shown to be broadly effective for people with migraines. The story does include a discussion of the harms caused by too much diagnostic testing in people with headaches that was very valuable. But the message about treatment is not nearly as strong as it could have been with support from real evidence.

Steroids are a standard treatment for pregnant women likely to deliver before 34 weeks because these drugs are known to reduce the chance of complications and death among premature infants. However, because completing the entire course takes at least 48 hours, health care providers may opt not to begin treatment when premature delivery is imminent.\n\nThe new study, supported by NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), provides strong evidence that even a partial course can have some benefit. Researchers evaluated 6,121 extremely premature infants who had been born between 22 and 27 weeks of pregnancy at sites in NICHD’s Neonatal Research Network. The study followed the infants from birth to 18 to 22 months of age and measured survival and brain and nervous system outcomes. The infants were grouped according to the mother’s steroid treatment — no treatment, partial treatment or complete treatment.\n\nAmong the three groups, researchers found significant differences in rates of death, complications such as bleeding in the brain (severe intracranial hemorrhage), intestinal problems (necrotizing enterocolitis), lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and brain and nervous system impairment. Infants in the complete treatment group fared best. Infants in the partial treatment group fared better than untreated infants. The study team also found evidence that the better outcomes likely were due to lower rates of bleeding in the brain and of a brain injury called cystic periventricular leukomalacia. Overall, these findings suggest that starting steroid treatment promptly — even if the likelihood of completion is low — is beneficial when extremely premature birth is imminent.\n\nAdditional funding for the study was provided by NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.\n\nWho\n\nRosemary Higgins, M.D., NICHD Neonatal Research Network program scientist and study author, is available for interviews.\n\nTo arrange an interview with Dr. Higgins, please call Linda Huynh at 301-496-5133 or e-mail nichdpress@mail.nih.gov.\n\nAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD): The NICHD sponsors research on development, before and after birth; maternal, child, and family health; reproductive biology and population issues; and medical rehabilitation.

Although women likely to deliver before 34 weeks are routinely given steroid treatment to reduce the chance of complications, physicians weren’t sure whether a partial course of treatment would provide the same — or any — benefits. In this new study, researchers concluded that ANS therapy was dose-dependent in providing protective effects against death or neurodevelopmental impairment in extremely preterm infants. The release claims that even partial steroid treatment can  benefit those born between 22 and 27 weeks of pregnancy.
Details on funding sources and treatment’s context are given high up in the news release. It also starts out well by providing some relevant figures, such as the number of subjects in the study, their gestational ages and follow-up times. However, other important quantitative data aren’t disclosed at all, such as the extent of the treatment’s benefits in the three groups, as well as the costs associated with steroid therapy. Instead, only sweeping, vague comparative language is used to illustrate complications and other outcomes, which leaves the reader wondering how beneficial steroid treatment really is.
Another major point that was not mentioned was the study’s limitations — namely that this was an observational cohort study that cannot establish cause and effect. Patients were not blinded to their treatments and were not randomized, which led to an unequal distribution of patients in the 3 groups in terms of socioeconomic status and other infant variables. In the end, the complete ANS treatment group already had distinct advantages from these factors in achieving better outcomes.

However, it is now known that physical training can relieve many of the symptoms, including the excessive fatigue and mobility impairments that are often seen. New research now shows that resistance training may protect the nervous system and thus slow the progression of the disease.\n\nThis is the main finding of a study conducted by a research partnership between Aarhus University, Aarhus University Hospital, the University of Southern Denmark and the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, that has just been published in Multiple Sclerosis Journal.\n\nThe study shows that resistance training has a number of positive effects on the brain, which go beyond what can be achieved through effective disease specific medication.\n\n""Over the past six years, we have been pursuing the idea that physical training has effects on more than just the symptoms, and this study provides the first indications that physical exercise may protect the nervous system against the disease,"" says one of the researchers behind the study, Associate Professor Ulrik Dalgas from the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University.\n\n""For the past 15 years, we have known that physical exercise does not harm people with multiple sclerosis, but instead often has a positive impact on, for example, their ability to walk, their levels of fatigue, their muscle strength and their aerobic capacity, which has otherwise often deteriorated. But the fact that physical training also seems to have a protective effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis is new and important knowledge,"" says Ulrik Dalgas.\n\nIn the study, the researchers followed 35 people with multiple sclerosis for six months. Half of the group engaged in resistance training twice a week, while the other half continued to live their lives normally without systematic training.\n\nPrior to and following the six-month period, the test subjects had their brains MR-scanned, and the researchers could see that there was a tendency for the brain to shrink less in those patients who undertook resistance training.\n\n""Among persons with multiple sclerosis, the brain shrinks markedly faster than normal. Drugs can counter this development, but we saw a tendency that training further minimises brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication. In addition, we saw that several smaller brain areas actually started to grow in response to training,"" says Ulrik Dalgas.\n\nThe researchers behind the study are still unable to explain why training has a positive effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis. A bigger and more in-depth on-going study will help to clarify this, and may also lead to improved treatment options, says Ulrik Dalgas. However, he stresses that the aim is not to replace medication with physical training.\n\n""Phasing out drugs in favour of training is not realistic. On the other hand, the study indicates that systematic physical training can be a far more important supplement during treatment than has so far been assumed. This aspect needs to be thoroughly explored,"" says Ulrik Dalgas.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether all people with multiple sclerosis can benefit from this type of exercise, as it has not been sufficiently tested in the more severely affected patients. Therefore, Ulrik Dalgas is not recommending that all multiple sclerosis patients throw themselves into intensive physical training regimes without first seeking professional advice.\n\n###\n\nFacts,\n\nMultiple sclerosis is an incurable disease of the central nervous system.\n\nThere are about twice as many women as men with multiple sclerosis.\n\nEighty per cent of people with multiple sclerosis live with the disease for more than 35 years.\n\nThe disease is found in both aggressive and more benign forms.\n\nThe cause of the illness is unknown, but both genetic and environmental factors play a role.']",No numbers are given to back up its benefit claims.,"This news release from Aarhus University in Denmark claims that resistance training twice a week could protect the nervous system by minimizing brain shrinkage in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, but offers no numbers backing the claims. The release summarizes a study published in the Multiple Sclerosis Journal on the protective effects of resistance training. It emphasizes to readers that resistance training should not replace medication, but instead supplement it. It also provides a study limitation — something not all news releases do. The release notes that it’s unclear whether the training could benefit all MS patients since this “has not been sufficiently tested in more severely affected patients.” The lead author further notes that he is not “recommending that all multiple sclerosis patients throw themselves into intensive physical training regimes without first seeking professional advice.”
We applaud the inclusion of this information. However, the main thing missing in this release is context. No numbers are given to back up its benefit claims. How much brain shrinkage was seen in patients undergoing resistance training compared to those who weren’t? And how much brain growth did researchers see in response to resistance training? Finally, does a change in cortical thickness translate to improvements in quality of life or cognitive abilities? Although thicker layers on a brain scan sounds good, it is how well a person feels and functions and how long they live that is more important.

One group was given 225mg of the drug twice a day for 12 weeks and the other participants were assigned to a placebo group. Fevipiprant and the placebo were added to the medications the participants were already taking.\n\nThe study was designed primarily to examine the effects on inflammation in the airway by measuring the sputum eosinophil count.\n\nThe sputum eosinophil is an inflammation measurement of a white blood cell that increases in asthma and is used to assess the severity of this condition.\n\nPeople who do not have asthma have a percentage of less than one and those with moderate-to-severe asthma typically have a reading of about five per cent.\n\nThe rate in people with moderate-to-severe asthma taking the medication was reduced from an average of 5.4 percent to 1.1 percent over 12 weeks, according to the study published today in the prestigious The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal.\n\nProfessor Christopher Brightling, who is a NIHR Senior Research Fellow and Clinical Professor in Respiratory Medicine at the University of Leicester, led the study at the NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, which is based at the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester.\n\nProfessor Brightling said: ""A unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms, lung function using breathing tests, sampling of the airway wall and CT scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works.\n\n""Most treatments might improve some of these features of disease, but with Fevipiprant improvements were seen with all of the types of tests.\n\n""We already know that using treatments to target eosinophilic airway inflammation can substantially reduce asthma attacks.\n\n""This new treatment, Fevipiprant, could likewise help to stop preventable asthma attacks, reduce hospital admissions and improve day-to-day symptoms- making it a \'game changer\' for future treatment.""\n\nGaye Stokes from Grantham in Lincolnshire has had severe asthma for 16 years. She took part in the trial and was part of the Fevipiprant group.\n\nThe 54-year-old said: ""I knew straight away that I had been given the drug. I felt like a completely different person. I had more get up and go, I was less wheezy and for the first time in years I felt really, really well.\n\n""For me, it felt like a complete wonder drug and I can\'t wait for it to be available because I really think it could make a huge difference to me.""\n\nAfter the 12 week trial and Gaye stopped receiving the drug, she said her health started to ""go downhill again very quickly"".\n\nProfessor Brightling added that the latest advance underpinned the work of the Leicester Precision Medicine Institute, a Centre of Excellence that coalesces and aligns the research missions of the University of Leicester and the NHS in Leicester.\n\nFuture treatment of human disease will increasingly move from a \'one size fits all\' approach to one of tailoring the treatment to the individual patient.\n\nAsthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways. When a person with asthma comes into contact with something that irritates their sensitive airways it causes the body to react in several ways which can include wheezing, coughing and can make breathing more difficult.\n\nThe NIHR Leicester Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit - a partnership between the University of Leicester and Leicester\'s Hospitals - focuses on promoting the development of new and effective therapies for the treatment of respiratory diseases including severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nAirPROM stands for \'Airway Disease Predicting Outcomes through Patient Specific Computational Modelling\'.\n\nThis is the technical name for the five year Europe-wide, EU funded project, which aimed to produce computer and physical models of the whole human airway system for people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nAirPROM has demonstrated how an integrated approach, involving modelling, measurement and clinical validation, can accelerate the development of new therapies and improve existing methods.\n\nAirPROM is led by the University of Leicester and coordinated by Professor Brightling.\n\n###\n\nIf media wish to link to the paper once it\'s published, they can use the following link, which will go live when the embargo lifts: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(16)30179-5/abstract']",This study of a new potential asthma treatment involved just 61 patients and lasted 12 weeks. The results may show promise but it will be years before the asthma pill reaches patients — if ever.,"This release explains the results of a small clinical trial testing whether the use of a new drug, fevipiprant, would be effective in reducing the serious symptoms of asthma.
It does a good job of reporting data on the primary goal of the research and then slips when suggesting the research had other positive outcomes but fails to provide any data backing that up. The release is further weakened by its inclusion of what is basically a testimonial for the new drug by one of the participants in the study.  And it fails to mention either costs or possible harms from using the drug, and ignores some rather substantial conflicts of interest among the investigators.

The comprehensive meta-analysis and assessment of human clinical trials, published in the official journal of the American Urological Association, The Journal of Urology®, assures practitioners and their patients that cranberry products are a low cost, low risk and effective way to help prevent recurrent UTIs.1\n\nTo answer the question, ""Can Cranberries Contribute to Reduce the Incidence of Urinary Tract Infections?"" a total of 28 studies showing results from nearly 5,000 patients were considered. Authors found a statistically significant risk reduction in repeat UTIs overall, but not significant for any particular subgroup. However, patients with recurrent UTIs who ingested cranberry products and had undergone gynecological surgery, experienced a significant reduction in UTIs.\n\n""Our investigation supports that cranberry products can be a powerful tool to fight off frequent UTIs,"" explains lead author, Dr. Ângelo Luís. ""While recommendations for dosage and duration of treatment require further study, the efficacy of the medicinal properties of cranberry products has been well-established.""\n\nThe review explains that the medicinal properties of cranberries may be attributed to their unique polyphenol, proanthocyanidins - or PACs, for short. Their ability to keep infection-causing bacteria from sticking to the urinary tract walls may be the major reason for their effectiveness in limiting infection growth and recurrence.\n\nAccording to the authors, scientists and practitioners continue to explore the use of alternative therapies in the prevention of common infections as part of the global movement to reduce antibiotic use and resistance. It is estimated that one third of women in the United States will get a UTI by the age of 24.2\n\n""Findings like this,"" adds Dr. Luis, ""give practitioners a viable, inexpensive, non-antibiotic option to help patients reduce the recurrence of an uncomfortable and potentially debilitating infection.""\n\n""As one of the oldest alternative therapies and U.S.-born berries, independent research such as this not only provides public health benefits, it revitalizes the enthusiasm for cranberry products year-round. The industry appreciates the efforts of these researchers and takes pride in the healthy attributes that cranberry products provide to consumers around the world,"" comments Terry Humfeld, executive director of the non-profit research and education-focused organization, The Cranberry Institute.\n\n###\n\nThis review was funded by Universidade da Beira Interior and bank Santander/Totta protocol post-doctoral research fellowship BIPD/ICI-FC-BST-UBI 2016 (ÂL).\n\nAbout the Cranberry Institute\n\nThe Cranberry Institute is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1951 to further the success of cranberry growers and the industry in the Americas through health, agricultural and environmental stewardship research as well as cranberry promotion and education.

If approved, Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc would sell the drug in the United States.\n\nHRA Pharma’s drug, approved last year in Europe under the name ellaOne, has re-ignited debate over “morning-after” pills in the United States, where reproductive issues are a constant political issue.\n\nWomen’s health advocates have welcomed the potential for another contraceptive option, but some critics contend the drug is more akin to the abortion pill, sold by Danco Laboratories as Mifeprex and also known as RU-486 or mifepristone.\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd sells a rival product, called Plan B, a two-pill regimen with generic competition from Watson’s Next Choice. Teva also sells a one-pill version of Plan B.\n\nBoth versions of Plan B, which are available over the counter for women at least 17 years of age, have only been proven to work for up to 72 hours after intercourse.\n\n“There is a medical need for an efficient emergency contraceptive product which acts consistently over a prolonged time period,” HRA Pharma said in a separate document released by the FDA.\n\nThe drugmaker has said its pill, also known by its chemical name ulipristal, works primarily by preventing ovulation of a woman’s egg. But the drug’s effect on the lining of the uterus — critical for a fertilized egg to develop — may also play a role, according to its label in Europe.\n\nFDA staff scientists, in their review, concurred.\n\nThe agency’s reviewers also said the company’s studies showed no unexpected side effects in women, although reports of nausea, headache and abdominal pain were common. It was not clear what effect the drug had, if any, when a woman still became pregnant despite taking it, they added.\n\n“Data on pregnancy outcomes after EC (emergency contraceptive) failure with ulipristal were too limited to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the effect of ulipristal on an established pregnancy or fetal development,” they wrote.\n\n“MORE LEEWAY”\n\nEmergency contraceptive pills have been available in the United States for more than a decade.\n\nPlan B, or levonorgestrel, was first approved in 1999. Efforts in 2001 to make it available without a prescription stirred fierce opposition from conservatives, and the bid stalled under the George W. Bush administration. Democrats angered by the delay threatened to block Bush’s nominee to run the FDA. Easier access to the drug won approval in 2006.\n\nHRA is not seeking to sell ella without a doctor’s prescription.\n\nAdvocates for women’s health have applauded the possibility of additional contraceptive options, saying a longer-lasting product could help women who want to avoid pregnancy.\n\nFor ella, “while you’re going to have to go and get a prescription for it, it gives you a little bit more leeway in terms of putting your ability to put your life on hold and get this healthcare need taken care of,” said Amy Allina, program and policy director for the National Women’s Health Network.\n\nCost is also an issue. With Plan B sold over the counter, most women have to pay for the drug themselves — roughly $50 — rather than have their health insurance cover it, Allina said.\n\nAnti-abortion groups oppose HRA Pharma’s drug, saying it is closer chemically to mifepristone than Plan B and pressing the FDA to reject the product.\n\nLike mifepristone, ella is a type of drug known as a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) that interferes with the hormone progesterone, which is critical for pregnancy.\n\nIf it is approved, it should be clearly labeled as an abortifacient, which would limit its distribution, the American Association of Pro Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists said in a letter to the FDA earlier this month.\n\n“There is no doubt that ulipristal acts an abortifacient because the drug blocks progesterone receptors at three critical areas,” an action that “interferes with the hormone action of progesterone to prepare the endometrium for implantation and to support the early pregnancy,” the group wrote.\n\nProponents agree that ella is similar chemically to mifepristone but say the dose given does not interfere with a pregnancy already underway.\n\n“There’s just no evidence that it causes abortion,” said Baylor College of Medicine professor Paul Fine, who also serves as medical director for Planned Parenthood in Houston and Southeast Texas.\n\nOn Thursday, the FDA’s advisers will weigh HRA Pharma’s data and offer recommendations before the agency later makes its approval decision.\n\nWatson shares were up 50 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $43.20 in morning trade. Teva shares were up 6 cents to $53.34 in New York.']","Although we can guess that this was viewed as a ""business"" story, it was just a shell of the necessary information that either investors or consumers would want/need and only parroted information that came from the FDA and the drug company.  ","By definition, emergency contraception is meant to be used only when other means of contraception fail. Controversy about emergency contraception typically centers around how it works – whether it prevents ovulation or blocks implantation of a fertilized egg. If emergency contraception works after fertilization, some would consider it an aborting agent. Regardless of its method of action, however, emergency contraception provides a safe and effective alternative to abortion. Although many women experience uncomfortable side effects from the medication, these are temporary and there are very few risks.
In the US, the most commonly used emergency contraceptive is Plan B or levonogestrel. It contains the progestin commonly found in most birth control pills, but in much higher doses. Plan B acts to prevent ovluation. Mifeprex, or RU-486, can be used as an emergency contraceptive or aborting agent depending on when it is used. Last year, the EllaOne was approved for use in Europe and the UK. It has been shown to be effective for up to 5 days after contraceptive failure and has few side effects. Now, the FDA will meet to decide on its approval for use in the US. 
This story about EllaOne does not mention costs, does not adequately describe the strength of the available evidence to support the drug and does not provide quantification of the benefits or harms of the drug. And it doesn’t quote any independent sources outside of the FDA or the pharmaceutical company. Quoting independent sources to provide some perspective on what this might mean to women would have greatly improved this story.

You should be consuming 600 international units daily if you\'re between the ages of 1 and 70, and 800 IU each day if you\'re 71 or older, according to the Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academcy of Sciences. (For a chart with a little more detail, see here.) These amounts are enough for 97.5 percent of U.S. and Canadian residents, according to the IOM.

""I think there\'s been a disconnect between the observational studies and the randomized clinical trials to date,"" Manson said. Over the past 15 years, those studies ""have looked promising, and very often they\'ve been reported by the media as suggesting that vitamin D has these benefits. I think there\'s a general perception that if some is good, more is better. I think it\'s important to understand that more is not necessarily better.""\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nManson is leading the most extensive clinical trial of vitamin D use ever, an examination of 25,875 people across the United States to determine whether vitamin D is helpful against cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, infection, autoimmune disorders and other conditions. The results are expected in late 2017 or early 2018.\n\nIn the meantime, how much vitamin D should you be consuming? The recommended dietary allowance works out to three or four servings each day of ""fortified"" foods such as milk, yogurt, soy beverages, orange juice or cereal, plus fatty fish twice a week, according to Manson\'s commentary.\n\nShe also called on physicians not to overscreen patients for vitamin D deficiencies, a practice that can lead to overprescribing it.\n\nAD\n\n""Large trials of other widely used supplements have sometimes found benefits,"" Manson wrote, ""but in other cases--such as with high doses of beta carotene, vitamin E and selenium--have disproven some health claims for these supplements and identified health risks that may not have otherwise been detected.""\n\nRead more:\n\nAD']","Many consumers and health care providers continue to hope that a pill, including a seemingly harmless one like vitamin D, will be the solution to a host of chronic diseases. This story explains why that thinking has a lot of holes in it.","The story urges readers to be cautious about consuming vitamin D supplements — particularly in high doses, which can increase a variety of health risks. The story stems from a recent commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which expressed skepticism about the wisdom of prescribing high doses of vitamin D and pointed to the lack of evidence that high doses of vitamin D were associated with health benefits.
We’re admittedly fans of any story that casts a skeptical eye on interventions that aren’t supported by solid evidence, and our (mainly positive) review reflects that slant.

A man’s “latency time” can also become reduced later in his sexual life, and this secondary form is usually defined as ejaculation within three minutes or less.\n\nIn the current study, researchers evaluated 10 randomized controlled trials that included comparisons either to another type of treatment or to a placebo, or dummy, treatment. Two studies were of acupuncture, five were of Chinese herbal medicine, one of Ayurvedic herbal medicine and two of Korean topical “severance secret” cream.\n\nTogether, the two acupuncture studies found that the treatment slightly increased intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) by about half a minute compared to placebo.\n\nChinese herbal medicine increased IELT by about two minutes, Ayurvedic herbal medicine increased IELT by nearly a minute and topical cream increased IELT by more than eight minutes.\n\nIn some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. For example, Chinese medicine paired with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increased IELT by two minutes longer than SSRIs alone and nearly three minutes longer than the Chinese medicine alone.\n\n“There are no approved treatments for premature ejaculation,” said Donald Patrick, vice chair for research at the University of Washington in Seattle. “This is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,” said Patrick, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We need treatments to address it, and it should be treated with equal seriousness as erectile dysfunction.”\n\nThe prevalence of premature ejaculation is difficult to measure because of the differing definitions of the problem and some men’s reluctance to report it. Some studies suggest that between 20 and 30 percent of men report early ejaculation concerns, but the International Society for Sexual Medicine estimates that about 4 percent of men have a lifelong condition.\n\n“Although it is not openly discussed in the media - at least not as much as erectile problems have been discussed in the post-Viagra era - numerous studies report men feel frustrated, depressed and anxious because of this problem,” said Ege Can Serefoglu of the Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nThe main limitation of the study is the underlying weakness of the studies evaluated. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the “gold standard” for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said.\n\nIn addition, the authors write, the studies are so different, it’s tough to draw conclusions about the different options. For example, the five Chinese medicine studies tested different substances, including Qilin pills, Yimusake and Uighur.\n\nSome studies, but not all, discussed side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, mild pain and decreased libido. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.\n\n“Nowadays, I am encountering alternative medicine-obsessed patients more than I used to, and it doesn’t make sense to argue with them about the treatment they want,” Serefoglu told Reuters Health by email. “After all, the placebo is a well-known clinical phenomenon, and some of my patients report surprisingly favorable outcomes.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2kCpsdv Sexual Medicine, online December 29, 2016.']","The story made clear that there were limitations to the data, and that the placebo effect could have played a big role.","This report of a systematic review of complementary medicine to treat premature ejaculation is fairly complete and includes important limitations of the research.

It’s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers — a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users.\n\nIn the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients’ histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain.\n\n(MORE: Will an Aspirin Prolong Your Life? It Depends)\n\nOverall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found.\n\nThe longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn’t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation.\n\nThe drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors’ ability to expand and develop blood supplies.\n\n“Given the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,” the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote.\n\n(MORE: Aspirin, a Wonder Drug? Studies Show It May Prevent Cancer)\n\nIn the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year. But taking aspirin and aspirin-like drugs isn’t without consequences: they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract, causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers. (One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.)\n\nBut given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs’ anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. “We hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,” Johannesdottir said in a statement. “Also, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use.”\n\nAlice Park is a writer at TIME.

For example, psoriatic arthritis manifests most often in the lower extremities and is associated with the autoimmune skin condition called psoriasis, in which raised red, scaly patches appear on the skin. Although psoriatic rashes most often precede the onset of the arthritic stage, the reverse can also be the case.\n\nOnly about half of psoriatic arthritis patients who are given TNF inhibitors get better.\n\nThree of the 10 top-selling drugs in the United States in dollar sales — adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab — are biologics prescribed for psoriatic arthritis as well as for the more common rheumatoid arthritis. These three drugs share a common property: They block the action of a pro-inflammatory substance called tumor necrosis factor. Secreted by various immune cells, TNF stimulates the immune response and accompanying inflammation.\n\nHowever, despite the availability of TNF inhibitors, “only about half of psoriatic arthritis patients who are given TNF inhibitors get better,” said Genovese.\n\nAlthough the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\n\nIxekizumab works by blocking IL-17. The drug, an injectable monoclonal antibody, is already commercially available for the treatment of psoriasis, for which it has been remarkably effective, said Genovese. And in an earlier Lilly-sponsored phase-3 trial, ixekizumab was shown to be effective for psoriatic arthritis patients who had not yet been treated with biologic drugs such as TNF inhibitors. (Another approved monoclonal-antibody that targets IL-17, secukinumab, was approved in 2016 for psoriatic arthritis.)\n\nLess pain and swelling\n\nOver the 24-week duration of the latest trial, 109 participants received ixekizumab every two weeks; 94 received placebo injections every two weeks; and 111 alternated every two weeks between getting injections of ixekizumab and the placebo. While 19.5 percent of patients who received only the placebo injections were judged to have met the trial’s specified clinical endpoint — at least a 20 percent reduction in the number of tender and swollen joints — the response rate among those getting the real drug every four weeks was 53.3 percent. Those getting the drug every two weeks didn’t do any better and were slightly more prone to side effects, such as a mild reaction at the injection site.\n\nAlthough any treatment that works by blocking the immune system’s ability to mount an inflammatory response should be carefully monitored for its potential to render the body vulnerable to infectious disease, there were few observed differences in this category between recipients of placebo versus active drug given every four weeks, Genovese said.\n\nLilly has filed for approval of the drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Genovese has served as a consultant to Lilly.\n\nOther co-authors of the study are affiliated with multiple institutions in diverse locations, including the University of Queensland, in Australia; Guy’s & Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, in London; St. Luke’s International University, in Tokyo; Memorial University, in Newfoundland, Canada; Lapeyronie Hospital, in Montpelier, France; Charite University Medicine Berlin, in Germany; and Eli Lilly and Company, in Indianapolis.\n\nStanford’s Department of Medicine also supported the work.']","This release covers most of the key questions about this drug, but not its side effects and steep cost.","This relatively thorough news release summarizes the results of a 24-week randomized trial of the biologic drug ixekizumab (marketed as Taltz) in patients with psoriatic arthritis.

The story addresses a key caveat — that the study has not been published in a journal and therefore hasn’t been rigorously scrutinized. However, it doesn’t give a clear description of what the comparison therapies (aka “usual care”) were. Nor does it provide cost data for the combination pill, which seems to be a key drawback since the study aims to explore whether it can be used to improve blood pressure treatment worldwide. Most significantly, it lacks independent sources who could weigh in on the significance of the findings.

So researchers have long sought a way to put back healthy insulin-producing cells, known as beta cells, into patients.\n\n“We’re trying to figure out a way to replace nature’s solution,” said Douglas Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFor years, physicians have been using beta cells from dead donors. But because the immune system of the recipient recognizes the donor cells as foreign, patients who receive a transplant have to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of their lives.\n\nThose drugs are not ideal, because they carry a risk of infection or cancer. Plus, donors are in short supply and can’t yield enough cells to treat the millions of people with type 1 diabetes around the world.\n\nThe researchers behind two studies published Monday demonstrated they had made progress on both fronts, encapsulating the cells in a protective bubble to shield them from the body’s immune response, and creating beta cells from stem cells, which are potentially limitless.\n\nFor the capsules, the scientists homed in on alginate — a seaweed extract — as the starting material. Alginate allows sugar and insulin to flow between the cells and the body, but blocks immune cells from reaching the beta cells.\n\nThe problem with existing alginates is that the body eventually catches on to the material as a foreign substance, suffocating the implant in a layer of scar tissue. So, Daniel Anderson, a bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, went in search of a better kind of alginate.\n\nIn one of two related studies published Monday, Anderson and his colleagues described in the journal Nature Biotechnology how they had tested 774 variations of alginate in rodents and monkeys and identified a handful that elicited a greatly reduced foreign body response.\n\nFor the other paper, published in Nature Medicine, the group embedded tiny capsules made from that durable alginate with beta cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. They then transplanted them into mice with a disease akin to type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe beta cells performed “every bit as good as the body’s own cells,” said Melton, a co-author on the Nature Medicine paper.\n\nThe transplanted cells controlled glucose levels in the mice without immune-suppressing drugs, the researchers reported. And when the scientists removed the capsules after almost six months, the cells were still cranking out insulin and there was little sign of an immune response to the capsules.\n\n“From very early on, we were getting great success,” said Arturo Vegas, a lead author of the papers who worked in Anderson’s lab before moving to Boston University, where he is now an assistant chemistry professor.\n\n“Everything kind of fell into place,” Vegas continued. “You saw less foreign body response. The human beta cells survived exquisitely well.”\n\nThe studies show “you can take stem cells and make a limitless supply of [human beta cells] and put them in a device and cure an entirely different species of animal,” Anderson said.\n\nJust because the system produced strong results in mice does not mean people will respond the same way. But experts say the findings provide hope for future treatments for people.\n\n“This is really the first demonstration of the ability of these novel materials in combination with a stem-cell derived beta cell to reverse diabetes in an animal model,” said Julia Greenstein, vice president of discovery research at JDRF, an organization trying to end type 1 diabetes that provided some funding for the studies. “Our goal is to bring that kind of biological cure across the spectrum of type 1 diabetes.”\n\nThe potential of the approach has attracted interest from both small startups and large biopharmaceutical companies that are looking at stem cell-based therapies for diabetes.\n\nOne company, San Diego-based ViaCyte, launched the first cell replacement clinical trial in 2014. Melton also recently helped start Semma Therapeutics, based in Cambridge’s Kendall Square neighborhood. Semma has not begun any human clinical trials yet, but the goal is to develop a device that once implanted could control someone’s blood sugar for a year or more, saving them from insulin injections and needing to check their blood sugar every few hours.\n\n“The individuals would not have to worry about that,” Semma CEO Robert Millman said.\n\nOther companies pursuing stem cells treatments for diabetes include Novo Nordisk (NVO) and BetaLogics, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).\n\nMost of these other companies are taking a different approach from the work done in the studies published Monday.\n\nThe MIT team has developed tiny capsules for the cells, but ViaCyte, for example, has created a larger device outfitted with the cells that gets inserted under the skin. And whereas the Massachusetts researchers examined beta cells exclusively for their study, the ViaCyte team is exploring using less mature cells that, once implanted, differentiate into both insulin-producing beta cells and those that secrete another hormone called glucagon that’s deficient in the disease.\n\n“The main issue with type 1 diabetes is a loss of beta cells,” said ViaCyte CEO Paul Laikind, “but there’s also good data out there to suggest dysfunction in other regulatory cell types.”\n\nThe team behind the studies published Monday, meanwhile, is working on tests now in monkey models. Vegas said that if the primate studies are successful, the next step will be developing a therapy to be used in people.\n\n“I think we’ve advanced the ball pretty far, almost as far you could get in an academic environment,” he said. “The talk is shifting toward doing something clinically.”']","This excellent, cautious examination of a pair of lab studies gives readers everything they need to know without hyping the potential for diabetes treatment.","This article does a really nice job of explaining the science behind two studies and appropriately depicting the pace of scientific process. With other news coverage talking about the research getting us “close to a cure” for diabetes, this story took a measured approach that should be posted on the walls of newsrooms everywhere. Yes, you can make a lab study exciting and engaging for readers without overstating the findings. A little more quantification of benefits and risks would have elevated this to five stars.

REUTERS/Albert Gea\n\nIn a study that followed older French adults for five years, researchers found that those who regularly used olive oil were 41 percent less likely to have a stroke than those who never used the oil.\n\nThe findings, reported in the journal Neurology, hint that the well-known connection between olive oil and heart disease might extend to stroke as well. Olive oil is a key ingredient in the so-called Mediterranean diet. And some clinical trials have suggested that the diet helps control risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure, abdominal obesity and elevated levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol.\n\nHigh olive oil intake is also linked to a lower risk of heart attack, and a longer lifespan among heart attack survivors. These latest findings support the general advice that people replace dubious dietary fats — namely, saturated fats and “trans” fats — with olive oil and other unsaturated fats, according to an expert not involved in the study. But he also stressed that the study does not prove that olive oil, per se, helps prevent strokes.\n\n“We need to remember that this is an observational study,” said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nThe study found a correlation between people’s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health — but that doesn’t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect.\n\n“People who use a lot of olive oil may be very different from people who don’t,” Scarmeas said.\n\nOlive oil users may, for example, have higher incomes, eat better overall or exercise more often than people who never use the oil. The researchers on the new study, led by Cécilia Samieri of the French national research institute INSERM, tried to account for those differences. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk.\n\nBut it’s impossible to fully account for all those variables, Scarmeas noted. What’s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. Such clinical trials are considered the “gold standard” of medical evidence.\n\nThe current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. People who said they used olive oil for both cooking and as a dressing were considered “intensive users.”\n\nOver the next five to six years, those intensive users suffered strokes at a rate of 0.3 percent per year. That compared with just over 0.5 percent among non-users, and 0.4 percent among moderate users.\n\nWhen the researchers factored in other diet habits, exercise levels and major risk factors for stroke — like high blood pressure and diabetes — heavy olive oil use was tied to 41 percent reduction in the odds of stroke.\n\nSamieri’s team also took blood samples from another 1,245 older adults, measuring their levels of oleic acid — a monounsaturated fat that accounts for most of the fatty acids in olive oil. The one-third of participants with the highest oleic acid levels were 73 percent less likely to suffer a stroke than the one-third with the lowest levels.\n\nThe findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil’s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.\n\nFor now, he suggested that people choose olive oil and other unsaturated fats over saturated fats (found largely in meat and dairy) and trans fats (found in some processed foods, like crackers, cookies and chips).\n\n“It’s better to rely on this type of fat for your overall health,” Scarmeas said.\n\nThat said, no single food is consumed in isolation, he points out in his editorial. Olive oil is one part of the Mediterranean diet that has been tied to heart benefits. The diet also boasts plenty of fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish and moderate amounts of red wine.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/SUxCM Neurology, online June 15, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story devoted almost as many words to the limitations of such an observational study as the entire <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=4047"" target=""_blank"">LA Times blog piece</a> did to the entire story.  That amount of real estate was warranted in order to help educate readers.</span>","This story explored the nature of an observational study about the stroke-reducing risks of olive oil.

Using HIFU, doctors can focus on treating only the cancer cells on the prostate while causing minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. Unlike more common and invasive treatments such as radiotherapy and surgical removal of the prostate gland, HIFU may be able to avoid side effects like urine leakage and impotence.\n\n(MORE: Circumcision: The Surgery that May Lower Prostate-Cancer Risk)\n\nThe new study, designed as a proof-of-concept study, involved just 41 men. Doctors used MRI and mapping biopsies to locate the cancerous tissues. They then focused high-energy sound waves on the affected area, causing the cancer cells to heat up to around 80°C, which kills the cells. None of the patients reported urinary incontinence a year after treatment, and only 1 in 10 suffered from poor erections. Overall, about 95% of the men were cancer-free after a full year following the trial.\n\n“The signal from this study is quite strong,” study author Hashim Ahmed, a urologist at the University College London, told Bloomberg. “When you look at the current standard of care, there’s a 1-in-3, or 1-in-2 chance of having the perfect outcome. In this study, after 12 months, it’s a 9-in-10 chance.”\n\nThe men in the study were aged 45 to 80 with medium- to high-risk cancer, and would likely have undergone surgery or radiotherapy down the line.

Therefore, screening and early detection may be crucial to our efforts to turn the tide against the growing threat of this devastating disease.""\n\nSteven Verdooner, NeuroVision CEO, said the imaging system leverages the company\'s expertise in autofluorescence imaging of the retina using a specialized ophthalmic camera and sophisticated image processing software. ""It\'s exciting to see these studies demonstrating the power of the technology applied to the Alzheimer\'s field. Our goal is to develop a product that is easy to use, affordable and widely accessible. We look forward to the potential of retinal imaging playing a vital role in solving the problem of Alzheimer\'s, both in identifying and monitoring those who may be affected by the disease. Our next step is to continue with clinical trials, building upon the existing pharmaceutical company collaborations, to ensure our technology is ready for the medical community to help manage this disease.""\n\nThe study\'s first author, Yosef Koronyo, a research associate at Cedars-Sinai and a scientist and inventor at NeuroVision, said the latest findings cap a decade of study that has produced several landmark discoveries. ""In 2010, our research group published an article providing the first evidence for the existence of Alzheimer\'s-specific plaques in the human retina, and we demonstrated the ability to detect individual plaques in live mouse models using a modified ophthalmic device.""\n\nAfter adapting the technology for human application, the researchers initiated several ongoing clinical trials in the United States and Australia to determine the feasibility of detecting and quantifying beta-amyloid plaques in patients with the disease.\n\nIn the new article, the researchers report on a 16-patient clinical trial to demonstrate the feasibility of identifying beta-amyloid in the eye using autofluorescence imaging. They also provide detailed analyses and several new findings on Alzheimer\'s pathology in the retina, results of research with donated eyes and brains of 37 deceased patients, 23 with confirmed Alzheimer\'s disease and 14 controls.\n\nAmong key findings, the researchers report a 4.7-fold increase in retinal plaque burden in patients with Alzheimer\'s, compared to controls, and they provide observations regarding geometric distribution and layer location of amyloid pathology in the retina. With the imaging technology\'s ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal beta-amyloid, these findings may lead to a practical approach for large-scale identification of the at-risk population and monitoring of Alzheimer\'s, the researchers say.\n\nThe article provides new insights into the disease\'s manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system. Here are several highlights:\n\nThe first histologic quantitative analysis of retinal plaque clusters, or ""hot spots,"" containing the most toxic forms of beta-amyloid with specific distribution patterns in superior peripheral regions that were previously unexplored.\n\nA detailed analysis of beta-amyloid deposit types using electron microscopy.\n\nThe first report of certain Alzheimer\'s-related pathologies in the retina, including vascular amyloid pathology.\n\nThe demonstration of a significant correlation between retinal and brain plaques, and coexistence of neuronal loss.\n\nThe first feasibility study for noninvasively detecting presumed amyloid deposits in retinas of living patients.\n\nThe demonstration of a fully automated calculation quantifying retinal autofluorescence that showed a 2.1-fold increase in patients with Alzheimer\'s, compared with controls.\n\n###\n\nResearchers from NeuroVision, Cedars-Sinai, the Doheny Eye Institute, Retina Vitreous Associates Medical Group, Retinal Consultants Medical Group, Sutter Neuroscience Institute, UCLA, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, and the University of Southern California contributed to the research and article.

This release clearly articulates the new elements being reported — retinal imaging in this case — in detection of Alzheimer’s. It also does a nice job explaining not only how the work was funded but also who supplied the material to do the experiments. What’s missing are important explanations about costs — especially given that cost comparison is a central selling point for this diagnostic tool in the release — and details about risks, details about benefits, and a fuller explanation of clinical applicability now versus in the future.

Researchers have found Women’s Health Initiative study” href=""https://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=65&abstractID=31341"" target=""_blank"">growing evidence in recent years that the majority of non-small cell lung cancers -- the most common form of lung cancer -- respond to estrogen with growth. So they wondered whether women taking tamoxifen as an adjunct to their breast cancer treatment might be less likely to develop or die of lung cancer.\n\nDrawing from a meticulously maintained Swiss registry of cancer patients, researchers followed 6,665 breast cancer patients in the Swiss canton of Geneva, 3,066 of whom took tamoxifen following breast cancer treatment. The researchers found that the tamoxifen group was very slightly less likely to develop lung cancer than breast cancer survivors who did not take the drug. But the difference was so small that they concluded it could have been a statistical fluke.\n\nBut deaths from lung cancer were distinctly more numerous among the women who had not taken tamoxifen than among those who had -- a difference significant enough for researchers to declare that by shutting off one source of fuel to an incipient lung tumor, tamoxifen may slow progression of the disease once it has taken hold in a woman’s lung.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers writing in the journal Cancer suggested that newer estrogen blockers on the market, including the osteoporosis drug raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, may also be able to slow the progression of lung cancer.\n\nEstrogen blockers such tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors have significant side effects and are generally used only for women past menopause. So they’re unlikely to become drugs for the prevention of lung cancer, as they currently are for breast cancer. But as researchers learn more about lung cancer and study whether early detection of this deadly cancer can save lives, the role of estrogen in helping those cancers take hold and grow will likely get more attention.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A very short summary (353 words) about an interesting study.

In new research that could suggest a road to cure, scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children\'s Hospital have found that CML stem cells die in response to inhibition of a protein called Ezh2. Drugs that target the protein are currently being tested in clinical trials for other cancers.\n\nThe findings, reported online today by the journal Cancer Discovery, raise the prospect that Ezh2 blockers, in combination with Gleevec and similar drugs, could eradicate the disease in some patients in relatively rapid fashion or could be an effective therapy for those who become resistant to Gleevec-like agents, the authors state.\n\nIn a paper published simultaneously by Cancer Discovery, a team of Scottish scientists report similar findings using a different research approach.\n\n""The vast majority of patients with CML do remarkably well on imatinib [Gleevec] and similar drugs: The disease is well controlled and side effects are tolerable,"" says Stuart Orkin, MD, the study\'s senior author and a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Dana-Farber/Boston Children\'s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. ""In only 10-20 percent of patients, however, are the leukemia cells fully cleared from the body. The other 90 percent retain a reservoir of leukemic stem cells - which initiate the disease - and must stay on the drugs permanently.""\n\nCML is a slowly progressing type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow. Primarily occurring in adults, it is rare in children.\n\nOver time, some patients develop resistance to Gleevec and other drugs that block BCR-ABL, the misbegotten ""fusion"" protein that drives CML growth. Although second- and third-line targeted therapies can often return the disease to remission, some patients don\'t benefit from these drugs or develop severe side effects.\n\nThe new study grew out of efforts to discover whether different types of cancer are susceptible to Ezh2 inhibitors. In laboratory experiments, the Dana-Farber/Boston Children\'s researchers found not only that Ezh2 is overabundant in leukemia stem cells but that it helps them survive and give rise to full-fledged CML cells. Follow-up studies in mice showed that inactivating Ezh2 through gene-editing techniques caused CML stem cells to die, halting the disease at its source.\n\n""The stem cells\' dependence on Ezh2 suggests they will be especially vulnerable to drugs that target the protein,"" Orkin remarks. ""Such drugs are already in clinical trials for other diseases, including lymphoma and some solid tumors.""\n\nEpizyme, a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, MA, recently opened a pediatric trial of an Ezh2 inhibitor for children with rhabdoid and other tumors. Dana-Farber/Boston Children\'s is a site in the multi-center Phase 1 trial.\n\nAlthough adding Ezh2-targeting agents to the standard drug regimen for CML has the potential to dramatically shorten the treatment period for many patients, ethical considerations may lead to the agents\' first being tested in patients who don\'t respond to Gleevec and similar drugs, either initially or after drug resistance develops, Orkin remarks. ""Our findings suggest inhibition of Ezh2 should be considered as a way to eradicate CML when used in combination with current targeted therapies. It offers a promising approach to shortening the duration of therapy in order to achieve a cure. If successful, the cost savings of such an approach could also be significant.""\n\n###\n\nJoining senior author Orkin, the study\'s lead author is Huafeng Xie, PhD, of Dana/Farber/Boston Children\'s. Co-authors are Cong Peng, Jialiang Huang, PhD, Bin E. Li, PhD, Woojin Kim, Elenoe C. Smith, Yuko Fujiwara, PhD, Partha P.

Bradner, MD, of Dana-Farber and the Novartis Institute for BioMedical Research; Shaoguang Li, MD, PhD, of University of Massachusetts Medical School; and Giulia Cheloni of UMass Medical School and the University of Florence, Florence, Italy.\n\nThe study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (grant UO1 CA105423) and Hyundai Hope on Wheels.\n\nDana-Farber/Boston Children\'s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center -- the nation\'s top pediatric cancer center, according to U.S. News & World Report - brings together two internationally known research and teaching institutions that have provided comprehensive care for pediatric oncology and hematology patients since 1947. The Harvard Medical School affiliates share a clinical staff that delivers inpatient care at Boston Children\'s Hospital and most outpatient care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.']",This teaser on a potential treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) needed to say upfront that the benefits from this potential drug were only seen in animal studies.,"This news release by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is a teaser on a potential new drug target for sufferers of a blood cancer called chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML, which affects 30,000 Americans a year.
The release spends a good amount of space explaining the condition and problems with a standard treatment — a drug called Gleevec (a brand-name version of the drug imatinib) — and how up to 90% of patients with the disease face a lifetime of medication that may eventually stop working. It also does a nice job explaining a biological pathway that helps drive CML and why it might be a mechanism to target in the future, specifically Ezh2 inhibitors.
However, the study was done in mice — not people. The release belatedly points this out in the final third of the text — but we would have liked to see it more prominently mentioned. The reason: The relevance may not transfer to people with CML. That’s also why we think the repeated use of the word “cure” and the possibility of shorter treatment in the headline is overstating and misleading. One glaring omission was that of price. The only allusion to price in the news release is an aside in the closing line noting shorter treatment times translate into cost savings. We’re also given no rough treatment cost estimates for an unnamed Ezh2 inhibitor made by Epizyme that’s mentioned in the release.

(Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ®, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. HETLIOZ® is currently approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder.\n\nJet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones. Jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption, a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning.\n\nThe clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). In the JET8 study, 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime. The JET8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones, which leads to jet lag disorder. This clinical design allowed for the study of HETLIOZ® without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions.\n\nResults from the JET8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of HETLIOZ® 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. Secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters (TST, LPS, WASO) and next day alertness (KSS and VAS). (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Summary of Primary and Key Secondary Endpoint Results\n\nAssessment Endpoint HETLIOZ® Placebo Difference p-value Summary p-value Detail\n\nPSG TST 2/3 * 216.4 156.1 60.3 p<0.0001 3.29E-12\n\n(minutes) TST full 315.8 230.3 85.5 p<0.0001 3.74E-14\n\n\n\nLPS 21.8 36.8 -15.1 p<0.01 8.08E-03\n\n\n\nWASO 144.6 219.1 -74.6 p<0.0001 3.41E-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKSS (1-9) average 4.0 4.5 -0.5 p<0.01 8.28E-03\n\nVAS (0-100) average 60.8 54.2 6.6 p<0.01 9.89E-03\n\n\n\n*Primary endpoint.\n\nThe results of the JET8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of HETLIOZ® in treating jet lag disorder. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. The demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both KSS and VAS is meaningful and it underscores the ability of HETLIOZ® to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder.\n\nVanda previously reported on the JET5 study (3101) that examined the effects of HETLIOZ® in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects\' usual bedtime. The results of that study were published in The Lancet in 2009.1 The observation that HETLIOZ® is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that HETLIOZ® will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag. HETLIOZ® will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.\n\nJet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel. Jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel. It is reported that more than 30 million US residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations. Of these, 60% (approximately 20 million) travel to destinations in Europe, Middle East and Asia. It is also reported that 8% (approximately 1.6 million) travel in Business or First class.2\n\n""We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of HETLIOZ® in the treatment of jet lag disorder as HETLIOZ® was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance. This challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from Los Angeles to London, Washington DC to Moscow, Paris to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. HETLIOZ® improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers,"" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, MD, Vanda\'s President and CEO.\n\nVanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of HETLIOZ® in the treatment of jet lag disorder. Vanda believes that if HETLIOZ® is approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of jet lag disorder it will potentially offer a therapeutic solution to many travelers and will likely represent an important commercial opportunity for the company.

HETLIOZ® has been granted market authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. For full U.S. prescribing information, please visit www.hetlioz.com.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ® (tasimelteon) than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection. The risk of adverse reactions may be greater in elderly (>65 years) patients than younger patients because exposure to HETLIOZ® is increased by approximately 2-fold compared with younger patients.\n\nIndication\n\nHETLIOZ® is indicated for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24).\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nHETLIOZ® may cause somnolence: After taking HETLIOZ®, patients should limit their activity to preparing for going to bed, because HETLIOZ® can potentially impair the performance of activities requiring complete mental alertness.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ® than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection. The risk of adverse reactions may be greater in elderly (>65 years) patients than younger patients because exposure to HETLIOZ® is increased by approximately 2-fold compared with younger patients.\n\nUse of HETLIOZ® should be avoided in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, because of a potentially large increase in exposure of HETLIOZ®, and a greater risk of adverse reactions. HETLIOZ® should be avoided in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers, because of a potentially large decrease in exposure of HETLIOZ®, with reduced efficacy.\n\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of HETLIOZ® in pregnant women. Based on animal data, HETLIOZ® may cause fetal harm. HETLIOZ® should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risks. Caution should be exercised when HETLIOZ® is administered to a nursing woman.\n\nHETLIOZ® has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended in these patients.\n\nSafety and effectiveness of HETLIOZ® in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\nAbout Vanda\n\nVanda is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies to address high unmet medical needs and improve the lives of patients.

The trial of 318 healthy volunteers in a sleep lab, the release states, showed “significant and clinically meaningful” benefits, namely an average 85 minutes more sleep, less wakefulness during sleep and some very modest average increases in alertness on two laboratory tests. The release noted reported side effects, particularly in older people, such as headache, nightmares, and urinary tract or upper respiratory infections. But no where in the release do readers learn a) how exactly the study mimicked 8-hour time zone crossings; b) the makeup of the study group with respect to age, gender, race, etc.; c) the fact that most jet lag goes away in a day or two without treatment; d) alternatives to the new drug such as “sleep education,” melatonin itself, or light therapy; and e) costs of the new drug and comparative therapies.
Readers do learn that the drug has been approved for a rare and chronic circadian rhythm disorder in totally blind individuals in whom certain sunlight-brain mechanisms are absent. But overall, this release smacks of being yet another “solution” in search of a “problem” serious enough to warrant what could be expensive pills in search of a very large (and mostly unnecessary) market.

This classic diet does not exclude a dinnertime glass of wine, however, sugary drinks, fried food, and sweets are not on the menu. Scientists believe this style of eating offers some protection against mental aging, and, above all else, it is heart healthy.\n\nA new study of over 15,000 people in 39 countries explored the benefits of this diet for one special group: those already diagnosed with heart disease. Surprisingly, the results suggest it might be possible they can have their cake and eat it, too.\n\nParticipants eating a Mediterranean diet showed a lower risk of heart attack and stroke, the researchers discovered; yet, eating healthy food appeared to be more important than avoiding unhealthy foods identified as typical of a so-called Western diet, such as French fries, fatty red meats, and, yes, even cake. (Though diet names refer to regions, they are not precise.)\n\nLed by Professor Ralph Stewart from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, a team of researchers asked 15,482 older adults with stable coronary artery disease to complete a lifestyle questionnaire. With an average age of 67, each was a participant in GlaxoSmithKline’s STABILITY drug trial, created to learn whether the drug reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. Participants lived in Western and Eastern Europe, North and South America, and the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThey answered questions about their diet and reported how many times a week they consumed servings from separate food groups. Looking at their answers, researchers gave them points in either the Mediterranean diet or Western diet category.\n\nOver nearly four years, 1,588 (about 10 percent) of the study participants suffered either a heart attack or stroke, or died. Those who ate more foods in the Mediterranean diet category were 3.5 times less likely to experience one of these three events than people whose diets more closely resembled the Western standard.\n\nIn fact, every one-point increase in a participant’s Mediterranean diet score was linked with a 7 percent reduction in risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. Look at it this way: if 100 people ate the highest proportion of Mediterranean foods and 100 ate the least, there would be three fewer heart attacks, strokes, or deaths among those who ate more foods from the Mediterranean diet. These findings held for every geographical region.\n\nNow here’s the interesting part: eating more foods thought to be less healthy — those typical of Western diets —did not link to an increase in heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Eating more healthy foods was the key, even if some unhealthy foods were also consumed along the way.\n\nAccording to Stewart, the meaning behind the numbers is clear. Instead of avoiding unhealthy foods, people with weak hearts might focus more on consuming healthy foods. That said, Stewart notes his study has limitations, including a lack of strict guidelines about portion size and no measure of total calories.\n\nLong-standing American Heart Association guidelines recommend a diet primarily consisting of fruits, vegetables, fish, and other whole foods, with limited amounts of sodium, sugar, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates.

Now, researchers have shed light on what one type of time-restricted eating does to the body.\n\nIn a small, preliminary study, researchers put 23 obese volunteers on the 16:8 diet, a form of intermittent fasting. Followers of the popular regime eat during an eight-hour window, in this case between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. And for the 16 hours in between, they consume only calorie-free drinks, such as water.\n\nFor 12 weeks, the scientists measured various factors, including the participants\' fat mass, blood pressure and cholesterol and glucose levels. The researchers compared the results to existing data from a separate weight loss trial carried out between 2011 and 2015.\n\nIndividuals who ate between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. consumed around 350 fewer calories, resulting in a loss of 3 percent body weight, and their blood pressure dropped by around 7mm Hg. However, their fat mass, insulin resistance and cholesterol levels were similar to the control group\'s.\n\nGetty Images\n\nKrista Varady, one of the study\'s authors and associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago\'s School of Applied Health Sciences, said in a statement that the take-home message from the study is that cutting out certain foods or counting calories aren’t the only effective methods for losing weight.\n\nThe authors noted that the results mirror those from previous studies of other forms of intermittent fasting, including alternate day fasting, where an individual eats normally every other day.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n""But one of the benefits of the 16:8 diet may be that it is easier for people to maintain. We observed that fewer participants dropped out of this study when compared to studies on other fasting diets,” said Varady.\n\nFurther research is now needed to uncover whether 16:8 works better than other fasting diets in terms of weight loss and health benefits.\n\nThe study\'s authors acknowledged that their preliminary data offers ""promise for the use of time-restricted feeding as a weight loss technique in obese adults, but longer-term, large-scale randomized controlled trials [are needed].""\n\nVarady stressed that ""when it comes to weight loss, people need to find what works for them, because even small amounts of success can lead to improvements in metabolic health.""\n\nCommenting broadly on fast-style diets, James Catterson of the Institute of Healthy Ageing at University College London, who was not involved in the study, previously told Newsweek the jury is still out on fasting diets.\n\nHe said that the data on the effects of fasting in animals are more convincing, probably because animals can be investigated in large sample sizes and in a highly controlled environment that is almost impossible to replicate in humans.\n\n""There are also many studies that either report no overall effect or sometimes the opposite. And this is where it gets a bit murky, as it is very difficult to put proper controls in place when performing studies to do with nutrition,"" Catterson said.\n\nHe concluded, ""So far, the consensus seems to be ‘let’s wait until more rigorous studies, with larger sample sizes that adjust for confounding lifestyle behaviors, have been performed before we conclude anything prematurely.\'""']",The story also would have been stronger had it used people-first language to help reduce stigma around obesity.,"This story described a small study of whether a regime that restricts eating to an eight-hour daily window help people reduce their risk factors for developing metabolic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. The story’s main strength is that it provided caveats early and often about the small size and short duration of the study and the need for more rigorous trials.
However, it didn’t give enough information to help readers understand whether weight loss and blood pressure improvements were sufficient to reduce disease risk. The headline also oversells the findings by stating that the fasting plan is “linked to weight loss and health benefits.” In fact, the study found most metabolic risk factors unchanged.
The story also would have been stronger had it used people-first language to help reduce stigma around obesity.

""The results also show that migraine surgery can lead to dramatic improvements in functioning and coping ability, even in patients who are very disabled before surgery.""\n\nStandard Pain Assessments Show Functional Improvement after Migraine Surgery\n\nSurgery has become recognized as an effective treatment option for selected patients with chronic, severe migraine headaches who do not respond to standard treatments. Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, migraine surgery procedures address trigger sites linked to certain headache patterns.\n\nHowever, most studies evaluating migraine surgery have relied on migraine-specific questionnaires. ""Pain questionnaires used in the evaluation of better-understood and more common pain syndromes have not been applied to migraine surgery,"" Dr. Austen and coauthors write.\n\nThe study evaluated the performance of one such questionnaire--the Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ)--in migraine surgery patients. The PSEQ has been used to study treatment outcomes in patients with a wide range of pain conditions. It provides information not only on pain scores, but also on functional disability and ability to cope with pain when performing normal daily activities.\n\nThe study included 90 patients who underwent migraine surgery, performed by Dr. Austen, between 2013 and 2015. Before and after surgery, patients were evaluated on a standard migraine questionnaire (the Migraine Headache Inventory, or MHI) and on the PSEQ. The final analysis included 74 patients who completed both questionnaires at one-year follow-up after migraine surgery.\n\nBefore migraine surgery, the patients had ""extremely poor"" PSEQ scores, indicating a high level of disability. Preoperative pain coping scores in migraine patients were substantially lower than reported for patients with other types of chronic pain--for example, neuropathic (related to nerve damage) pain, arthritis, or lower back pain.\n\nOne year after migraine surgery, the patients had a very large percent improvement in average PSEQ score: on average, 112 percent higher than baseline. That was much higher than in studies of patients with other types of chronic pain: for example, an average 19 percent improvement after nonsurgical treatment for low back pain.\n\nMigraine surgery improved functioning and coping even in patients with very low initial PSEQ scores. That\'s in contrast to patients with musculoskeletal problems such as low back pain, in whom low PSEQ scores predict poor treatment outcomes.\n\n""It seems that migraine surgery patients can recover function and ability to cope with pain very well after surgery, in stark contrast to what has been shown in other pain conditions,"" Dr. Austen and coauthors write. They note that surgery also led to an average 76 percent improvement in the migraine-specific MHI score, measuring outcomes like headache frequency, duration, and severity.\n\nThe new study shows ""continued positive outcomes"" after migraine surgery in appropriately selected patients, including large improvements in migraine-related disability. Dr. Austen and colleagues conclude, ""Chronic pain questionnaires such as the PSEQ add to our understanding of functional outcome after surgery and put pain in migraine surgery patients in perspective to better-known pain conditions.""\n\n###\n\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer.\n\nClick here to read ""Ability to Cope with Pain Puts Migraine Surgery Patients in Perspective.""\n\nDOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000003955\n\nAbout Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\n\nFor more than 70 years, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® (http://www. prsjournal. com/ ) has been the one consistently excellent reference for every specialist who uses plastic surgery techniques or works in conjunction with a plastic surgeon.

This news release discussed a study from the journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery which claims that migraine surgery can lead to “dramatic improvements” in patients’ functionality and quality of life. Migraine surgery entails decompressing nerves around the face and head of migraine sufferers. The procedure is like a permanent version of Botox injections, which temporarily relax facial muscles and have proven to be effective in treating several (though not all) kinds of migraines. Though the news release was enthusiastic about the study’s findings, it failed to mention several big limitations, including that the results were based off a self-reported pain questionnaire (self-reports are often ripe for bias). It also did not mention that the questionnaire is only able to determine self-efficacy and functionality in patients — not pain reduction or decrease in symptom severity. Finally, the news release did not compare the treatment to any other migraine-specific alternatives, nor did it address the possible harms of facial surgery.

And, the FDA has already approved it.\n\n""Our data suggests that PPF, working in combination with TMZ and radiation, could limit glioblastoma invasion and improve the clinical outcome for brain tumor patients,"" said Dr. Tran, the study\'s senior author.\n\nThis study was funded, in part, by The Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation.\n\n""GBM is one of the most aggressive of all cancers and it affects people of all ages,"" said Catherine (Bracken) Ivy, founder and president of The Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation. ""Funding research focused on helping patients survive longer is critical, and studies such as this advance our goal of not only improving treatments for brain cancer, but eventually finding a cure.""\n\nOne of the primary treatments for glioblastoma is surgical removal of the tumor. However, because of the aggressive way glioblastomas invade surrounding brain tissue, it is impossible to remove all parts of the tumors, and the cancer eventually returns and spreads. This insidious cancer invasion also limits the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy.\n\nTGen found that PPF works to limit the spread of glioblastomas by targeting and knocking down the expression of the TROY protein. TGen researchers have linked TROY to the cellular mechanisms that enable glioblastomas to invade normal brain cells, and resist anti-cancer drugs.\n\n""New therapeutic strategies that target the molecular drivers of invasion are required for improved clinical outcome,"" said Dr. Harshil Dhruv, a TGen Research Assistant Professor and lead author of the study. ""Propentofylline may provide a pharmacologic approach to targeting TROY, inhibiting cell invasion and reducing therapeutic resistance in glioblastomas.""\n\nOne of the fundamental challenges in treating brain cancer with drugs is what is known as the blood-brain barrier that separates circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid in the central nervous system. This barrier works to protect the brain from toxins. However, this security system is so effective at protecting the brain that it prevents many life-saving drugs -- all but some small molecules -- from being able to treat cancer and other diseases of the brain.\n\nAs a result, there has been little progress in recent decades in finding new effective treatments for GBM. Median survival for newly diagnosed GBM patients is only 14.6 months. Only 5 percent of patients survive more than 5 years.\n\n""Clinical trials revealed that PPF can cross the blood-brain barrier, and has minimal side effects,"" Dr. Tran said. ""PPF could be easily translated to the clinic as an adjuvant therapy in combination with standard of care treatment for GBM patients.""\n\n###\n\nThis study -- Propentofylline inhibits glioblastoma cell invasion and survival by targeting the TROY signaling pathway -- also was funded by the National Institutes of Health under grants NS86853 and P50 CA108961.

The release also miscasts the threat posed by glioblastoma multiforme. It calls the disease the most common primary tumor of the brain and central nervous system and warns that “it affects people of all ages,” without noting that the disease is diagnosed in only about 2 or 3 people per 100,000 population each year, or only about 1 percent of all cancer cases.

Research is urgently needed to improve detection and treatment and to save lives. The findings of this project will play a crucial role in these efforts going forward.\n\nFunded by the Bowel Disease Research Foundation (BDRF) charity, the work has been published in the Lancet Oncology journal.\n\nThe study worked with data on more than 10,000 patients, examining whether current methods of checking if anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes are giving experts an accurate picture of survival rates. The research team was led from Manchester, working hand in hand with centres in Leeds and Switzerland.\n\nAnal cancer that has spread to lymph nodes is linked to a worse prognosis and lower chance of survival.\n\nThe project\'s findings however have uncovered a phenomenon suggesting rates of lymph node spread are being overestimated, potentially leading to overtreatment of patients with chemo radiotherapy.\n\nThis can result in damaging side-effects, and doctors are particularly keen to avoid it in cases where it offers little benefit to the patient at potentially great cost.\n\nThe results will be crucial to future large scale trials looking at optimum care for anal cancer patients. By identifying a unique phenomenon, these results will be taken into account by future work and ultimately could lead to better diagnosis of tumour stage and thus better treatment.\n\nChristie consultant and University of Manchester Professor of Cancer Studies and Surgery, Andrew Renehan, leads the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC) Anorectal Organ Preservation Research Group. He said: ""These high-profile results will play a vital part in improving patient care. Our research team has done a wonderful job highlighting an important and as yet unrecognised issue in the staging of cases of anal cancer.\n\n""These findings will help us to better understand how anal cancer patients should be treated, ultimately improving survival rates and quality of life. It is crucial that we tackle what is becoming an increasingly common form of cancer through research studies like this. These findings could provide learnings for other cancers too.""\n\nChristie patient Jill De Nardo, who is 58 from Buxton, was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2010. She said: ""My first thought on diagnosis was that I wanted to survive, I gave little thought to long term or late effects of treatment. Fortunately my treatment has been successful and seven years on my own late effects are manageable but will only get worse. Many are not so fortunate and live daily with the discomfort and impact of side effects such as joint pain and continence issues.""\n\nJill adds: ""Anal cancer is on the increase and those of us who have been through what at times was gruelling radiotherapy regimen, welcome this study and the impact it will have on the treatment plans of patients in the future.""\n\n###']",Readers would have been better served by an acknowledgement that there are weaknesses inherent in meta-analysis of studies.,"This news release summarizes a review of 65 randomized controlled trials and observational studies that included some 10,000 people with anal cancer. The analysis itself is important: it exposes the potential for misclassification of disease severity leading to over-treatment of many patients with radiation and chemotherapy, unnecessary side effects, and little or no improvement in outcomes for patients. But the release doesn’t include any of the weaknesses that enter in when results are based on data-mined meta-analysis of previously published studies.
The headline touting a “breakthrough in the “treatment” of anal cancer and the almost complete absence of data leaves readers with misleading or confusing information about problems in diagnosing and treating a rare but deadly and difficult disease.

This new development represents a big step forward in personalised medicine.\n\nIn this clinical study, a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (MCRPC) was given a novel drug combination consisting of investigational drug ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide, an approved prostate cancer drug. The research team successfully utilised CURATE.AI to continuously identify the optimal doses of each drug to result in a durable response, allowing the patient to resume a completely normal and active lifestyle.\n\n""Dynamic dosing in cancer therapy is not commonly used. In fact, drug dosing changes in oncology are typically performed only to reduce toxicity. CURATE.AI uniquely modifies drug dosing to increase efficacy. Our clinical study has shown that dosing can profoundly affect the efficacy and safety of treatment. A patient\'s clinical profile changes over time. The unique ability for CURATE.AI to rapidly identify the drug doses that result in the best possible treatment outcomes allows for actionable, and perpetually optimised personalised medicine,"" explained Professor Dean Ho, Director of the Singapore Institute for Neurotechnology (SINAPSE) at NUS, who led the study.\n\nCombating cancer with combination therapy\n\nCombination therapy represents a cornerstone in modern cancer treatment. Using this approach, multiple drugs are used to attack the processes that support cancer growth. A primary objective when designing combination therapies is to achieve drug synergy, where the drugs work together to substantially improve efficacy.\n\nWhile combination therapy has generally improved treatment outcomes such as overall survival for many cancers, it is predominantly given at both fixed as well as high doses.\n\nProf Ho added, ""Patients respond to chemotherapy differently from one another. Even a single patient\'s response to therapy can vary substantially over the course of treatment. In fact, many patients do not respond at all to the drug combination because the dosages, which can profoundly impact efficacy, are not suitable for them. Therefore, while fixed dose combination therapy represents a standard of care, it may also serve as a barrier to realising truly optimal and personalised medicine.""\n\nHarnessing AI to continuously optimise combination therapy dosing\n\nTo overcome the challenges of conventional combination therapy, the NUS team of engineers developed the CURATE.AI platform, which uses the patient\'s own clinical data - such as their drug doses and corresponding changes to tumour sizes or levels of cancer biomarkers in the blood - to calibrate his or her unique response to treatment. This calibration is then used to create an individualised CURATE.AI profile, or map, that identifies the drug doses which enable the best possible treatment outcome at any given point in time.\n\n""No two patients\' profiles are alike, and as a patient\'s body and the cancer itself evolve during treatment, the CURATE.AI profile evolves as well, enabling the clinical and engineering teams to optimise care for the entire duration of treatment, an unprecedented advance for combination therapy,"" Prof Ho explained.\n\nIn this study, which was conducted at the UCLA Institute of Urologic Oncology for a period of over a year, a patient with metastatic prostate cancer was given ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide. Reducing the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the patient\'s blood served as the primary biomarker to determine if the patient was responding to treatment. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the cancer lesions monitored the extent of disease progression.\n\nInitially, the doses of ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide were adjusted by the clinicians to better manage patient-reported quality of life. The patient\'s initial drug doses and PSA levels were then used to construct his personalised CURATE.AI profile. Remarkably, CURATE.AI subsequently identified a ZEN-3694 dose that was 50 per cent lower than the patient\'s starting dose of the drug prior to CURATE.AI analysis. Prospective dosage guidance by CURATE.AI resulted in the lowest PSA levels observed for the patient during the course of the study. As treatment progressed, slight increases in ZEN-3694 dosing resulted in clear decreases in PSA levels, also demonstrating its key role in suppressing the metastatic cancer. CT imaging of the patient\'s lesions showed that disease progression was halted as a result of CURATE.AI-guided combination therapy of both ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide. Patient care guided by CURATE.AI is currently ongoing.\n\n""Using CURATE.AI to dynamically modify drug doses and successfully treat a metastatic cancer patient represents a landmark breakthrough for the use of AI to truly personalise patient care. This advance is expected to dramatically improve response rates for all combination therapies that are being developed for oncology as well as virtually all other diseases. We can also expect CURATE.AI to markedly reduce the costs of drug development,"" Prof Ho added.\n\nDr Allan Pantuck, the lead clinician of the study, added, ""With fixed dose therapy, patients are often switched to other drugs when they no longer respond to treatment. However, CURATE.AI has shown that patients can still respond to the therapies that have seemingly stopped working by continuously identifying the patient\'s optimal dosing parameters.""\n\n""The implementation of CURATE.AI represents a game-changing shift in the way that combination therapy can be optimised at the single patient level, and we have shown that N-of-1 medicine can be a reality. We are excited that CURATE.AI could ultimately enhance patient accessibility to important new combination therapies, saving lives in the process,"" said Prof Ho, who is also from the Biomedical Engineering and Pharmacology departments at NUS, as well as a member of the Biomedical Institute for Global Health Research and Technology (BIGHEART) at NUS.\n\nThe research was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles, and Zenith Epigenetics. The findings were published in Advanced Therapeutics on 29 August 2018.\n\nMore clinical trials underway\n\nCURATE.AI is applicable to all diseases and all patients, and a first generation of the platform was previously validated in the clinic for single drug optimisation in post-transplant immunosuppression. This new study demonstrates that CURATE.AI can optimise multi-drug regimens.\n\nMultiple clinical trials using CURATE.AI-guided combination therapy for oncology and additional applications such as post-transplant immunosuppression are underway. In addition, patient recruitment for additional oncology trials in Singapore has been approved.\n\nThe CURATE.AI team expects to broadly deploy the platform for the prevention of transplant rejection, adult and paediatric cancers, cardiovascular medicine, diabetes management, infectious diseases, and many other applications.\n\n###']",The release claims the researchers were able to improve treatment success by adjusting treatment dose and presumably still minimizing side effects. But that’s impossible to prove based on a single patient.,"This news release focuses on a paper from Singapore-based researchers who used artificial intelligence (AI) to treat cancer in a single patient. The release argues that this is a “gamechanger” and a “big step forward” that “is applicable to all diseases and all patients” — which are bold claims to make based on the treatment of only one patient.
Unjustifiable language throughout and a lack of attention to key details like harms, cost and an explanation of the severe limitations of the research make this a weak and misleading release.

But the patches, marketed under the brand name Salonpas, are nothing new. They\'ve been sold in various countries in Asia since the 1930s, according to their manufacturer, the Japanese firm Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical.\n\n""Salonpas is the Western world catching up with Asia,"" said Dr. Rick Rosenquist, a professor of anesthesia and director of pain medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine and chairman of the American Society of Anesthesiologists\' committee on pain medicine.\n\n""If you are an Asian kid, you\'ve had these placed on you since time immemorial,"" he said. ""It\'s just now starting to hit more mainstream in the United States. They\'re gaining more acceptance.""\n\nBefore the FDA action, pain-relieving patches were available in the United States only by prescription, said Dr. John Dombrowski, director of the Washington Pain Center in Washington, D.C. Their active ingredients include such medications as lidocaine, capsaicin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. The active ingredients in Salonpas are methyl salicylate and menthol, common components of pain-relieving gels and creams, such as Bengay.\n\nPain patches have a number of benefits, Rosenquist and Dombrowski said, not the least of which is convenience. With a patch, you ""put [it] on and forget about it, rather than having to remember to take pills,"" Dombrowski said.\n\nThe patches also deliver their medicine directly to the site of a person\'s pain. This may eliminate some of the side effects that come with taking pills. For instance, some analgesics are likely to cause an upset stomach unless they\'re taken with food. ""Obviously, patches get around that,"" he said. ""It\'s a very clever way of getting the medications right where they need to be.""\n\nAnd, because patches release their medication slowly into the body through the skin, people also should get more consistent pain relief than they do with pills.\n\nOn the other hand, people have to be sure to carefully follow instructions for using the patches, to avoid overdose.\n\nThe main downside to pain patches, however, apparently comes from their effect on the skin. Some people may find themselves allergic to either the active ingredient in a patch or the adhesive used to keep the patch on the body.\n\n""You need to pay attention when you put them on, to see if you have any kind of skin reaction to the compounds that are contained in the patch,"" Rosenquist said.\n\nBoth doctors said that they expect more over-the-counter pain patches to hit the market if the popularity of Salonpas continues to grow. Future over-the-counter options, they predicted, could include reduced-dosage versions of the NSAID-delivering patches now available through prescription.\n\n""Success begets success,"" Dombrowski said.

Colic affects up to 28% of infants and has no known cause or cure.\n\nHowever, recent research suggests colic may linked to an immature immune system struggling with bacterial imbalances in the gastrointestinal tract, and that high levels of E. coli bacteria in particular may contribute to colic symptoms. Some researchers question whether symptoms could be alleviated using probiotic therapy, or ""healthy"" bacteria to restore bacterial balance in the gut.\n\nTo test this theory, the Italian researchers compared 25 healthy infants who were randomly assigned to receive drops of Lactobacillus reuteri to 21 healthy infants randomly assigned to receive placebo drops. All the infants were diagnosed with colic, born full-term at a healthy gestational weight, had no history of gastrointestinal disorders, were breastfed, not formula fed, and did not receive any other probiotic supplements during the week prior to the study. The infants\' mothers were also advised to avoid cow\'s milk in their own diets during the study period.']","<span style=""font-size: larger;"">One of our reviewers wrote, ""WebMD apparently was phoning it in on this one.""

The Drexel senior would get paid for what sounded to him like playing Nintendo. Maybe it could even help him remedy his weakness in math, he thought. So he signed up for a University of Pennsylvania study on ""the effects of Lumosity on brain activity and decision-making behavior."" There\'s much more at stake here than the fortunes of an industry whose revenue is expected to hit $6 billion a year by 2020. Or whether Weber can do math more easily in his head than using a calculator.\n\nStudies on brain games have offered mixed results. Some are promising, but others indicate the games offer little more than recreation.\n\n""There\'s some evidence that brain games can improve cognitive functions,"" says Caryn Lerman, professor of psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine and deputy director of Penn\'s Abramson Cancer Center.\n\nBut the more important question, she says, is ""can we change the brain to change behavior?""\n\nLerman is one of two principal investigators in the $2 million study, financed by the National Cancer Institute. She and her coinvestigator, assistant psychology professor Joseph Kable, say the institute wants to see whether brain circuits that are active when we display restraint can be stimulated by brain games.\n\nIn other words, could brain games help with healthy behaviors such as proper diet and avoiding smoking - which explains the institute\'s interest.\n\nThe trial involves 200 adults ages 18 to 35, the range when adopting healthy behaviors does the most good. All are given a functional brain MRI to test areas such as working memory, sustained inhibition, and response inhibition.\n\nHalf the subjects are then asked to play Lumosity, a popular brain game, five times a week for 30 minutes. The other are given free video games not designed to stimulate the brain. A second brain MRI then follows.\n\n""Our theory,"" Lerman says, ""is that if you activate these higher brain networks that are involved in executive control, the brain will assert more top-down control over lower regions of the brain that drive people to these gratifying behaviors like [unhealthy] eating and smoking.""\n\nAnswers are expected in a year or less.\n\n""Based on extensive research,"" Lumosity\'s website states, the game ""improves memory, attention, processing speed, and problem-solving skills so you can feel more confident in your abilities.""\n\nA consensus statement last year by 70 cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists found such claims highly questionable.\n\nThe group, assembled by the Stanford Center on Longevity and the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, stated: ""Claims promoting brain games are frequently exaggerated and at times misleading.""\n\nPractice a specific skill enough, and you will get better at it, the group said. But that doesn\'t mean ""general and lasting improvements of mind and brain.""\n\nA Lumosity official asked that questions be submitted by e-mail but then declined to respond to a request for independent studies supporting the company\'s claims.\n\nArthur F. Kramer, director of the Beckman Institute for Science and Technology at the University of Illinois, was a signer of the consensus statement. He says that after decades of studies, there is no evidence brief interventions like brain games translate into lasting effects in the real world.\n\nWhat does work, he says, is physical exercise such as running and walking.\n\nJason Chein, principal investigator at the Neurocognition Lab at Temple University, is more optimistic. A study using two groups of 20 Temple students in 2007-10 found memory training on a computerized program designed by the lab not only made the students better at playing the game, but also appeared to enhance discipline and reading comprehension.\n\nHad he been asked, Chein said, he would not have signed the consensus statement. ""It\'s too negative, and I\'m not sure it really reflects the scientific consensus.""\n\nStill, if computerized brain games are proved to work, he said, ""you\'d have to figure out why, for whom, and under what circumstances. There\'s favorable evidence, but we have a lot of investigation to do.""\n\nJoseph Santos, a Drexel University sophomore in Lerman\'s study, says since playing Lumosity, he feels ""my memory is improving. I remember things I used to forget. I\'ve been doing somewhat better on exams. . . . My reactions are a little bit faster.""\n\nResearchers say it\'s common for test subjects to perceive improvements even if they aren\'t measurable. Weber, the Drexel senior in the study, wasn\'t sure whether the brain games had made him any sharper.\n\nBut neither Weber nor Santos will know for sure because research subjects generally don\'t get their individual results.\n\nDawn Mechanic-Hamilton, clinical director of the Cognitive Fitness Program at the University of Pennsylvania, says she has used a commercial brain game, Brain HQ, in her work with adults with mild cognitive impairment and has found it helpful in combination with classwork and individual coaching. But she doesn\'t see it as a magic bullet.\n\n""If you\'re going to spend time doing other things that are cognitively challenging,"" she says, such as taking music lessons or learning a language, ""then you shouldn\'t replace it with a computerized program.""\n\nOn the other hand, she said, brain games are likely better for you than a few hours of TV watching - but even that\'s not clear.\n\n""We just don\'t know a lot of stuff we need to,"" she said.\n\nAn April report from the Institute of Medicine puts brain games fairly low on the ladder of recommended ways to improve cognition or maintain abilities.\n\nKramer says the entire field is far too complex for any one definitive trial. Walter R. Boot, an assistant professor of psychology at Florida State University, estimates it may be a decade before psychologists can know for sure whether brain games can be effective and, if so, in what ways and for which populations.\n\nLerman hopes to bring the final answer a bit closer, partly through using MRI scans to measure brain function before and after the subjects have played Lumosity or standard video games.\n\n""We know what parts of the brain and what circuits light up when people are doing these exercises,"" Lerman says.\n\n""What we haven\'t tested is whether a program of 10 weeks changes the brain in a way that\'s sustainable and helps people change their behaviors.""\n\nRX FOR YOUR BRAIN\n\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine, the jury is still out on whether brain games improve cognitive health for people trying to stave off normal age-related declines.\n\nIn a recent report, ""Cognitive Aging: Progress in Understanding and Opportunities for Action,"" the institute analyzed the best available evidence and came up with this prescription for\n\ncognitive health:\n\nWhat Helps\n\nExercise.\n\nStaying socially and intellectually active.\n\nHealthy diet.\n\nGetting good sleep.\n\nKeeping your heart healthy.\n\nWhat Hurts\n\nDepression.\n\nHearing and vision loss.\n\nSome medications, including antihistamines.\n\nStress.\n\nAir pollution.\n\nBuyer Beware\n\nBrain games.\n\nSupplements.\n\nSOURCE: Institute of Medicine']","This story explores how so-called “brain games,” like Lumosity, stack up against other habits that can help you stay mentally sharp.","This story raises the issue of whether so-called “brain games,” like Lumosity, actually do what they’re advertised as doing — improving brain function. The story includes comments from sources both supporting and opposing these games and cites authoritative evaluations of the evidence. It also includes an extensive list of alternative approaches that may be better than games for improving cognitive function.
However, the story offers little real data to underpin the coverage, only anecdotes. And while it does raise most of the appropriate questions about such programs, readers expecting a definitive answer, or at least a sampling of existing data, are going to be disappointed. Then again, many readers will likely be satisfied to learn the bottom-line conclusions that trustworthy third parties have drawn regarding these games.

These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said.\n\nIn prior studies, bisphosphonates have already been shown to be associated with a reduced odds for breast cancer.\n\n""These [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers,"" said lead researcher Dr. Gad Rennert, from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Medicine and chairman of the department of community medicine and epidemiology at the Carmel Medical Center of Clalit Health Services in Haifa, Israel.\n\n""This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins,"" he said, noting that ""bisphosphonates and statins share the same metabolic pathway.""\n\nThe results of the U.S. National Cancer Institute-supported study are published in the Feb. 14 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nFor the study, Rennert\'s team collected data on almost 1,900 postmenopausal women who took part in the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study, which is a population-based trial in northern Israel.\n\nThe researchers found that taking bisphosphonates, mostly Fosamax, for at least a year was associated with a significant 59 percent reduction in relative risk for colorectal cancer.\n\n""The magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study; however, it is very significant after controlling for a dozen other known risk factors,"" Rennert said.\n\nThey took into account factors such as family history, ethnic background, diet, physical activity, weight, vitamin D consumption and the use of other drugs such as aspirin, statins and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nThe findings in this study show that bisphosphonates are associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer, but they cannot confirm a causal effect -- that is, the study doesn\'t prove that the use of bisphosphonates is responsible for the lower risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body, which is similar to how cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins work, according to Rennert. These same researchers also found in another study that statin use also reduced the risk of colorectal cancer, he noted.\n\n""We also found a similar effect last year with risk of breast cancer, which has already been replicated by three other groups,"" Rennert added.\n\nA randomized trial is need to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said. ""It should be relatively easy, as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect,"" he said.\n\nThe researchers noted, however, that the risks of using bisphosphonates include the possibility, in rare cases, of osteonecrosis of the jaw (destruction of the jawbone or jaw tissue). Bisphosphonates used for osteoporosis have also been linked to a rare fracture of the thigh, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n""The adverse effects profile is of major importance if bisphosphonates are going to be recommended for cancer prevention in healthy people,"" the study authors cautioned.\n\nCommenting on the study, Eric Jacobs, Strategic Director of Pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said that ""the lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing.""\n\nHowever, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies, he said. ""Results from the only other study of bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer, a recent large study from the United Kingdom, do not support an important protective effect,"" Jacobs noted.\n\nFortunately, there are other proven ways to help lower risk of colorectal cancer, he said. ""In particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on colon cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The difference between this story and the competing <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3632"" target=""_blank"">Reuters Health story</a> was slim but significant yet easily fixed. A bit too much boosterism in this one – right from the start. </span>","One can tell a lot about how a story is going to be from its lead quote. This HealthDay story on a new study indicating potential cancer prevention benefits from bone density drugs — quoted Dr. Gad Rennert, the study’s lead author, sounding “These [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers. … This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins.” From there on, Rennert is allowed to pump up the benefits of these drugs and to sweep aside any concern about their risks or broad application to a large population. Contrast that with the Reuters Health story which chose to quote Eric Jacobs from the American Cancer Society saying, “The lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing….However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies.” From that point on, the story took a cautious, objective look at the study’s findings. We wish both stories had done a better job parsing the evidence, but we think that, overall, Reuters Health provided better context for readers.

""We may be able to use this information to help guide treatment decisions and counseling of patients early on, when it may be more effective.""\n\nOnly subjects who had lost consciousness for less than 30 minutes were eligible for the study, and many study subjects never lost consciousness during their injury.\n\nScientists refer to concussion as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), but for some patients the harmful, sometimes insidious effects are long lasting. Common symptoms in the aftermath of concussion include confusion, headache, changes in vision or hearing, thinking or memory problems, fatigue, sleep changes and mood changes. Previously there has not been a way to predict whose symptoms will fade or persist following mTBI.\n\nAlthough effective drug treatments for mTBI await discovery, rest and counseling are known to be helpful for patients, Mukherjee said.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers focused on well-known networks of activity that are observed when the brain is in a resting state. ""We asked subjects to close their eyes, to relax, and to not focus their attention on anything specific -- but also to not fall asleep,"" Mukherjee said.\n\nIn comparison to the control subjects, who had never experienced TBI, mTBI patients displayed less connectivity in frontal areas of the ""default mode network,"" a set of brain regions that are particularly active in the resting brain. They also exhibited less connectivity within several other networks, including those known as the executive control network, the fronto-parietal network, the dorsal attentional network, and the orbitofrontal network; they showed an increase in connectivity in the visual network. Several of these differences were associated with worse performance months later in cognitive and behavioral tests.\n\n###\n\nUCSF radiologist Esther Yuh, MD, PhD, associate professor of radiology, served as the lead neuroradiologist and also contributed to the analysis for the new study. Postdoctoral fellow and first author Eva Palacios, PhD, led the data analysis for the fMRI experiments. The study was part of the ongoing Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) project, through which Mukherjee and study co-author Geoffrey Manley, MD, PhD, vice chairman of neurological surgery at UCSF and chief of neurosurgery at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, along with collaborators from many other research institutions are leading studies and gathering common data across research sites to more quickly advance TBI research.\n\nAdditional co-authors include researchers from UCSF, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and University Hospital Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nThe research was funded through project grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense.\n\nUC San Francisco (UCSF) is a leading university dedicated to promoting health worldwide through advanced biomedical research, graduate-level education in the life sciences and health professions, and excellence in patient care. It includes top-ranked graduate schools of dentistry, medicine, nursing and pharmacy; a graduate division with nationally renowned programs in basic, biomedical, translational and population sciences; and a preeminent biomedical research enterprise. It also includes UCSF Health, which comprises top-ranked hospitals, UCSF Medical Center and UCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospitals in San Francisco and Oakland -- and other partner and affiliated hospitals and healthcare providers throughout the Bay Area.']",When does a technology stop being new? Is functional MRI from 1991 still a “new MRI method?”,"This news release from the University of California – San Francisco (UCSF) describes how functional MRI (fMRI) could be a predictive tool for physicians in determining a patient’s prognosis after a concussion. Researchers scanned the brains of 75 patients aged 18 to 55 to assess the connectivity of certain neural networks, particularly those active in the resting brain. They found that patients with reduced connectivity in “resting state networks” were more likely to do worse on cognitive and behavorial tests. They argued that this could also predict post-concussive symptoms in patients who showed no evidence of bruising or bleeding in the brain right after a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).
Although the news release does a good job explaining the nuts and bolts of the study, we felt the wording was ambiguous or misleading at times. For example, fMRI is not exactly a new technology, as it was first introduced to the world in 1991, and it’s not clear from the release why the research is novel.
Other important details that were missing were discussions on the study limitations and the scope of the benefits. In this case, how effective was fMRI in predicting changes in brain activity and long-term symptoms after a concussion? Some numbers would have been welcome here.
We acknowledge that the original journal article also used comparative wording without referring to any quantitative data. However, we feel the news release could have clarified some points by directly asking the researchers for more information.

REUTERS/Nacho Doce\n\nThe study, of 123 middle-aged and older adults, found that those who added yoga classes to standard diabetes care shed a handful of pounds over three months. Meanwhile, their average blood sugar levels held steady — in contrast to the non-yoga-practicing “control” group, whose blood sugar levels rose.\n\nThe findings, reported in the journal Diabetes Care, do not suggest that yoga should replace other forms of exercise for people with type 2 diabetes — a disease commonly associated with obesity.\n\nTo really lose weight and rein in blood sugar, more-vigorous exercise would work better, according to Shreelaxmi V. Hegde of the Srinivas Institute of Medical Science and Research Center in Mangalore, India.\n\nAmong the 60 study participants who took yoga classes several times a week, the average BMI — a measure of weight in relation to height — declined from 25.9 to 25.4. A BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight.\n\n“In our study the effect of yoga on BMI (body mass index) and blood sugar control was marginal,” Hegde, the lead researcher on the work, told Reuters Health in an email.\n\n“But,” she added, “it should be noted that yoga controlled the blood sugar levels which otherwise rose in the control group.”\n\nIn addition to that, the study found, signs of so-called oxidative stress declined in the yoga group.\n\nOxidative stress refers to a situation where levels of reactive oxygen species or “free radicals” — damaging byproducts of energy use in cells — rise beyond the body’s capacity to neutralize them. Long-term oxidative stress is believed to contribute to a host of chronic diseases.\n\nIn this study, Hegde’s team measured participants’ blood levels of certain chemicals that reflect oxidative stress. They found that, on average, the yoga group’s levels of the chemicals dipped by 20 percent.\n\nThe significance of that is not clear. Hegde said that if such a decline in oxidative stress were sustained over time, it might lower the chances of diabetes complications, which include heart and kidney disease, nerve damage and damage to the blood vessels of the eyes.\n\nFurther, long-term studies are needed to see whether that is the case, the researchers say.\n\nAccording to Hegde, yoga may curb oxidative stress because it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system — the part of the nervous system that basically acts as a brake against the gas pedal of the sympathetic nervous system.\n\nThere are caveats. The yoga used in this study was a gentle form, Hegde said, and parts of the practice were adapted for people who had additional health problems; certain poses were avoided in people who had heart disease, for example.\n\nIn the real world, yoga classes vary widely. Some are vigorous work-outs involving complicated poses that would not be appropriate for older adults with chronic health conditions.\n\nOlder adults with diabetes can look for yoga classes designed specifically for older people and those with chronic medical conditions. In the U.S., hospitals and local community centers are increasingly offering such classes.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/qJGXZ4 Diabetes Care, online August 11, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The headline and the story discuss potential benefits but any potential benefits are not quantified sufficiently.  A more critical evaluation of the evidence was needed.  </span>","The story discussed the impact of yoga on levels of ‘oxidative stress’.  The story never clarified that the link between oxidative stress and disease is tenuous at best.  Even the weight loss was not really quantified; what does “a handful of pounds” really mean?

It is also the first clinical trial investigating the efficacy, tolerability and safety of intranasal-administered oxytocin in young children with autism.\n\nAutism is a group of complex brain developmental disorders characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and stereotypical and repetitive behaviours. The diagnosed incidence is estimated to be one in 68 children and effective interventions remain limited.\n\nBehavioural therapies can improve social, emotional and behavioural impairments but these are typically time consuming (40 hours per week), remain costly and show mixed outcomes. There is currently no medical treatment for these problems.\n\nIn this new study, 31 children aged three to eight years of age received a twice daily course of oxytocin in the form of a nasal spray.\n\n""We used some of the most widely used assessments of social responsiveness for children with autism,"" said autism expert, Associate Professor Adam Guastella of the Brain and Mind Centre.\n\n""We found that following oxytocin treatment, parents reported their child to be more socially responsive at home, and our own blind independent clinician ratings also supported improved social responsiveness in the therapy rooms of the Brain and Mind Centre,"" he said.\n\nOverall, the nasal spray was well tolerated and the most common adverse events were thirst, urination and constipation.\n\nThis is the first time a medical treatment has shown this type of benefit for children with autism and findings reinforce outcomes from a longer sustained program of research by this team.\n\nOver the last 10 years Brain and Mind Centre researchers have been documenting the benefits of oxytocin in humans, revealing that it enhances eye gaze, emotion recognition and memory across a range of populations.\n\nStudy co-author and co-director of the Brain and Mind Centre, Professor Ian Hickie noted the new results were a critical first advance in the development of medical treatments for the social deficits that characterize autism.\n\n""The potential to use such simple treatments to enhance the longer-term benefits of other behavioural, educational and technology-based therapies is very exciting,"" he said.\n\nMost recently the team has linked observed changes from treatment to brain changes associated with social circuitry. The next step in the research is to understand exactly how oxytocin changes brain circuitry to improve social behavior, and to document how related treatments might be used to boost established social learning interventions.\n\nThe researchers are seeking to further develop the potential of oxytocin-based interventions within the context of good multi-disciplinary care for autism.\n\n###']","This news release omits quantified benefits and a description of the evidence, some of which were available in the published study.","This news release from the University of Sydney describes a published study on a group of 31 young children with autism (ages three to eight years old) who were treated twice a day with oxytocin nasal spray.

The release omitted many of the details contained in the published study, including quantified benefits and a description of the evidence.

That is why patients need a CT scan to confirm the type of stroke before receiving tPA.\n\nEvery second counts, in the current standard of care, patients who experience stroke-like symptoms and call 9-1-1 arriving to the hospital by ambulance are assessed by clinical examination and imaging (CT or MRI scan) in the Emergency Department.

Researchers analyzed information about patients\' disabilities to determine how many needed to be treated in the mobile stroke unit to yield a greater benefit in disability outcomes when compared to patients who received tPA at the hospital.\n\nThe findings bordered on statistical significance, suggesting that future clinical trials with a greater number of patients are needed to show similar benefits.\n\n""People should know the warning signs of stroke and call 9-1-1 as soon as they observe stroke signs,"" said Nour.

Clot busting drugs are an established part of the tool kit in reducing damage related to strokes. Understanding exactly when to administer them is key to making sure they are used in the most effective way possible. This release describes a study of one mobile stroke unit’s experience administering clot-busting drugs — or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).
These study findings have not been peer reviewed for publication in a journal and appear to have major caveats around them. We won’t know all the details until the full study is published, and so we were pleased to see some caution expressed in the news release. A few more additions, like cost information and a better explanation of the benefits, would have helped make this release even better.
[Editor’s note: A reference to clot-busting drugs “saving lives” was removed from the review. As noted in the comments section, the scope of benefits offered by tPA is controversial and the American Heart Association withdrew “life-saving” claims about tPA as discussed in these BMJ and Mother Jones stories.]

But however that review ends, one thing is clear, interviews with researchers and a review of scientific studies show: the energy drink industry is based on a brew of ingredients that, apart from caffeine, have little, if any benefit for consumers.\n\n“If you had a cup of coffee you are going to affect metabolism in the same way,” said Dr. Robert W. Pettitt, an associate professor at Minnesota State University in Mankato, who has studied the drinks.']","We found no glaring problems with the reporting of this valid story, so it gets a top 5-star score.  But we question whether the subject matter warranted front-page attention in a 2,000-word article. ","We’re not in the habit of criticizing news organizations for devoting too much space to stories that debunk dubious health claims. But with so many important health stories screaming for attention, we think it’s legitimate to question the Times’s investment of resources in this particular issue. Since there’s almost no human research on the health effects of energy drinks, the question of whether or not they work shouldn’t take very long to address. And we think there was room to discuss the serious health hazards that have been increasingly linked to these products in greater detail.
We’re not taking issue with the substance of the story, which was generally excellent as our score indicates. And we realize that there’s a counter-argument to be made about the significance of this coverage. (Because these drinks are so popular, and some people obviously perceive that they work, it’s an important public service to examine the claims more thoroughly.) We just think there were better, more consequential health stories to put on the front page of one of the nation’s leading newspapers.
Note: as discussed below in our review, Paul Raeburn at the Knight Science Journalism Tracker also had concerns about this story. His post is worth a read. Excerpt:
“In a story of this length, he and his editors could have done a more thorough job of reminding offline readers why these drinks have provoked concern.
The revelation that energy drinks don’t seem to do anything beyond delivering a caffeine jolt is not the kind of news that should earn a place on the front page. I doubt many readers will be surprised by this, and Meier can’t say much with certainty about the drinks because they haven’t been studied.
In my view, the story deserved about half the space it got. Meier’s editors might have done better to put this one on page B7, and the November story about deaths and injuries on page one. Maybe they were atoning today for underplaying the first piece.”

Migraine symptoms, which can be debilitating for many people, are the sixth leading cause of disability, according to the World Health Organization. While there is no cure, a new study published in Cephalalgia in March shows single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a new way to prevent migraine attacks. It\'s safe, easy to use and noninvasive.\n\nMULTIMEDIA ALERT: Video and audio are avaiable for download on the Mayo Clinic News Network.\n\nResearchers at Mayo Clinic and other major academic headache centers across the U.S. recently conducted the study that examined the effectiveness of using a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation device to prevent migraine attacks. The eNeura SpringTMS Post-Market Observational U.S. Study of Migraine study, also known as ESPOUSE, instructed participants to self-administer four pulses with the device in the morning and four pulses at night over three months to prevent and treat migraine attacks as needed. Spring TMS stands for Spring transcranial magnetic stimulation or sTMS.\n\n""The migraine brain is hyperexcitable, and basic science studies have demonstrated modulation of neuronal excitability with this treatment modality,"" says Amaal Starling, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist, who is first author of the study. ""Our study demonstrated that the four pulses emitted from this device twice daily reduce the frequency of headache days by about three days per month, and 46 percent of patients had at least 50 percent or less migraine attacks per month on the treatment protocol. This data is clinically significant. Based on the current study and prior studies in acute migraine attack treatment, sTMS not only helps to stop a migraine attack, but it also helps prevent them.""\n\n""For certain patients, treatment options for migraines, such as oral medications, are not effective, well-tolerated or preferred,"" Dr. Starling adds. ""The sTMS may be a great option for these patients and allow doctors to better meet their unique needs.""\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration already had approved the sTMS device for the acute treatment of migraine with aura. The FDA now has approved it to prevent migraine, as well.\n\n###\n\nAbout Mayo Clinic\n\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization committed to clinical practice, education and research, providing expert, comprehensive care to everyone who needs healing.

The industry-funded study referenced in this news release suggests twice-a-day, self-administered “pulses” with a portable home device (manufactured by the study funder, eNeura), may have reduced the frequency of headaches in a small cohort of predominantly Caucasian women with episodic migraines.
The news release does well in establishing the need for non-pharmacologic alternatives in treating this disabling condition, but falls short in explaining a host of limitations in the study that render the beneficial results highly questionable.
It also neglects to let readers know the study is funded by a manufacturer of the device used in the study, and that many of the authors have financial ties to this company.

They surely enjoyed the fruit in its natural form — not processed into pomegranate extract pills.\n\nThese days, a number of companies sell pomegranate supplements and say the pills are a more convenient way to benefit from the fruit’s potent antioxidants. The most aggressive of these manufacturers is POM Wonderful, the company that also makes pomegranate-based juices, teas and snack bars. Each of its Pomx Pills provides the same “antioxidant power” as 8 ounces of Pom Wonderful 100% pomegranate juice without the 160 calories or 34 grams of sugar, the company says.\n\nThe appeal of antioxidants stems from studies showing that diets high in antioxidant-rich foods may be linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, some types of cancer and other health problems. Antioxidants neutralize dangerous molecules called free radicals that, if left unchecked, can damage cells.\n\nBut claims that pomegranates, in particular, are good for the heart and prostate overstate the benefits of the fruit in any form, and especially in pills, says Dr. John Gordon Harold, a cardiologist at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If people want to take them, that’s fine, but it’s not based on any scientifically valid information,” says Harold, who is also a spokesman for the American Heart Assn. (The AHA does not take positions on individual commercial products.)\n\nFor close to a decade now, Pom Wonderful has touted what it claims are the fruit’s scientifically proven health benefits. The Los Angeles-based company has invested $34 million in pomegranate research, including studies on the fruit’s ability to improve cardiovascular and prostate health and erectile dysfunction.\n\nThat marketing approach captured the attention of the Federal Trade Commission. Last year, the agency filed a complaint against the company for “making false and unsubstantiated claims that their products will prevent or treat heart\n\ndisease, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPom is fighting the charges.\n\n“We disagree with the FTC and believe that the manner in which we have communicated the results of our scientific research is both truthful and appropriate,” the company said in a statement. “Our scientific research, which is world-class, shows that there are significant, healthful benefits associated with drinking pomegranate juice.”\n\nThe company also chastised the agency for targeting a “natural food product” instead of “focusing on manufactured and processed foods that make exaggerated health claims based on ingredients that have been added to the food in a laboratory. … Pomegranates are inherently healthy.”\n\nIndeed, the pomegranate is “probably the most well-studied fruit we have,” says Dr. David Heber, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition and a recipient of Pom funding.\n\nHeber, who has conducted more than a dozen studies on pomegranates, says the fruit contains a powerful set of antioxidants, including compounds called anthocyanidins and ellagitannins. While some of these are found in other red-pigmented fruits and vegetables, including strawberries and red cabbage, other antioxidants, such as punicalagins, are found only in pomegranates and some rare herbs, he says.\n\nIt can be difficult to know precisely what parts of the fruit — and which specific antioxidants — are in commercial supplements because they’re not tightly regulated, Heber says. Pom crushes the entire pomegranate — skin, rind and all — to make its products, the company says.\n\nMost of the evidence in favor of pomegranate’s health effects comes from laboratory and animal studies, and most of them focus on the juice, not the pills.\n\nA review of studies on pomegranate juice published this year in Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice concluded that the beverage appeared to reduce blood pressure and slow the buildup of plaque in the arteries. But only five of the studies in the analysis were conducted in humans (the rest involved mice or test tubes), and they were small to boot. For instance, a widely cited 2001 study showing a 5% decline in blood pressure in people who drank 1.7 ounces of pomegranate juice daily for two weeks involved just 10 participants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s less evidence to support the claim that pomegranate juice can prevent or treat prostate cancer. Animal research has been remarkably promising, says Hasan Mukhtar, a professor of cancer research at the University of Wisconsin Medical Science Center who has examined the juice in his own lab (with funding from Pom in some cases). But human research on the subject is limited to a single clinical trial, which lacked a proper placebo control, he says. (That 2006 trial, published in Clinical Cancer Research, showed that consuming 8 ounces of pomegranate juice daily slowed the increase of prostate specific antigen, a marker of prostate inflammation or cancer, in men with prostate cancer.)\n\nEvidence of the fruit’s ability to treat erectile dysfunction is even more preliminary. A liquid pomegranate extract made by Pom and tested in rabbits improved penile blood flow and erectile function but did not fully restore it, according to a 2010 study. A 2007 study of 53 men with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction found no statistically significant differences in function between men who drank 8 ounces of pomegranate juice a day and those who drank a placebo daily for four weeks.\n\n“There’s no definitive clinical trial” demonstrating a beneficial effect of pomegranate fruit, juice or pills in people, Harold says.\n\nBecause the antioxidants in pomegranates are chemically stable, they should have the same activity when concentrated in a pill as they do when found in juice or in a fruit, Mukhtar says.\n\nBut the larger issue is whether actively seeking such antioxidants in concentrated form is worth the money, Harold says.\n\nPomx Pills cost about $30 for a one-month supply. The cost of other pomegranate supplements ranges from about $10 to $20 for a month’s supply. (Most makers recommend 1 gram of pomegranate extract a day.)\n\n“If they’re part of an overall healthy diet, I don’t object,” Harold says, “but I’m not sure the ends justify the means.”\n\nhealth@latimes.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">One of the best examples we have seen reporting on the evidence (or lack of it) regarding a supplement for very specific health claims.</span>","This was not one of the LA Times’ Healthy Skeptic columns, but it may as well have been.  As that column often does, this story dampened the hype surrounding claims for pomegrante juice and pills.

These drugs were involved in nearly 9,000 overdose deaths in 2015, according to federal data. But there’s a catch: Such overdoses seem to be very closely tied to the opioid epidemic, with the majority of benzodiazepine overdose deaths involving both benzodiazepines and opioids.\n\nA new study published in BMJ looked at just how much the concurrent use of these two drugs increases the risk of overdose versus the risk of only using opioids. Drawing on a huge sample of nearly 320,000 patients who were continuously enrolled in private health insurance plans from 2001 and 2013, researchers compared those who were prescribed just opioids versus those who were prescribed both, and what their additional risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission was in the period they were prescribed both.\n\nThe study found that among all opioid users, concurrent use of benzodiazepines more than doubled the risk of an emergency room or inpatient visit for a drug overdose.\n\nThe study also found that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use could reduce the risk for an opioid overdose–related emergency room or inpatient visit by 15 percent. If that reduced risk applies to overdose deaths as well, eliminating concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use could have prevented up to 2,630 opioid painkiller–related overdose deaths in 2015.\n\nKeith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study, said this reveals an underappreciated policy lever for reducing drug overdoses: making sure patients prescribed to opioids aren’t also prescribed to benzodiazepines, and vice versa. “Even if we didn’t change opioid prescribing at all, the data here suggest that we could cut overdoses dramatically just [by] getting prescribers to not put people on a benzodiazepine at the same time,” Humphreys said.\n\nYet the study suggests the opposite has happened. From 2001 to 2013, co-prescriptions to opioids and benzodiazepines among the studied pool of patients increased from 9 percent to 17 percent — a nearly 89 percent jump.\n\nFor some patients, eliminating these co-prescriptions could involve some tough trade-offs. If someone genuinely suffers from pain and anxiety, doctors and patients will need to work out which condition is more important to treat and which one can be treated with alternatives — to avoid a potentially deadly overdose. (Hopefully while keeping in mind that there’s no good scientific evidence that opioids can treat chronic pain, so opioids aren’t the right treatment for chronic pain in the first place.)\n\nThere are some caveats to the study. For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren’t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn’t involve a trip to a doctor. The study also only looked at legally prescribed opioid painkillers and benzodiazepines, missing the effects of concurrent use of illegally obtained pills or drugs. And since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period, it’s possible the findings don’t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage. (Although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results.)\n\nFinally, since the study looked at correlation (not causation), it’s possible that it missed some other factor driving up overdose deaths among concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid users — perhaps, for whatever reason, these users may be more likely to misuse their drugs.\n\nStill, it’s well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each other’s overdose risk. So it’s not really controversial to conclude that simultaneously using opioids and benzodiazepines dramatically increases the risk of drug overdose — or, conversely, that stopping the concurrent use of these two drugs could reduce the risk of overdose.\n\nGiven that the opioid epidemic has quickly turned into the deadliest drug crisis in US history, it’s important — and potentially lifesaving — for doctors and policymakers to at least consider the study’s findings.\n\nFor more on the opioid epidemic, read Vox’s in-depth explainer, the abridged explainer, or the maps and charts explainer.']",This story highlights the dangers of taking both opioid painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines–but it misses the mark by stating it would be “simple” to fix this problem.,"This story highlights the dangers of taking both opioid painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines–but it misses the mark in a few ways, primarily by proclaiming researchers “just uncovered a simple way to combat the opioid epidemic.”

It’s the guy who heads to the pool one night a week and endures a workout that might make Michael Phelps gasp for air. It’s the weekly rock climbers and double spin class-takers schvitzing their Sunday away. These weekend warriors cram the recommended amount of exercise into one or two days, while the rest of us faithfully head to the gym multiple times a week for a half-hour hamster run on the treadmill.\n\nRelated: Americans keep getting fatter, new report shows\n\nA paper published January 9 in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests these warriors may be onto something. In a study based on nearly 64,000 adults, researchers in the U.K. found that weekend exercise appears to be just as effective at preventing heart disease and cancer as exercise done more frequently. This is great news for anyone who feels too busy on weekdays to work out but enjoys outdoor activity on the weekend.\n\nTry Newsweek for only $1.25 per week\n\n“I think that the weekend warrior physical activity pattern is beneficial because they are actually doing a large proportion of vigorous intensity activity. And vigorous activity makes you fit, and fitness reduces your risk of disease and death,” says Gary O’Donovan, a researcher in physical activity and sedentary behavior at England’s Loughborough University and lead author of the paper.\n\nO’Donovan and fellow researchers looked at data on middle-aged adults who responded to a government-sponsored household survey conducted from 1994 to 2012. The survey included questions about health history and fitness habits. The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records.\n\nThey found the risk of death from all causes was about 30 percent lower for weekend warriors, compared with adults who maintained a sedentary lifestyle. And the warriors had a 40 percent lower risk of cardiovascular death and an 18 percent lower risk for cancer-related death. The mortality rates of weekend warriors were roughly the same as those who claimed to exercise more than two days a week but for shorter durations.\n\nHowever, there are also some limitations to this study, the researchers say. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. The information about physical activity was reported by the participants, and it’s likely that many were too generous in their estimates of how much time they spent at the gym. Unfortunately, taking 20 minutes in locker room to put on your sneakers doesn’t count as a workout.\n\nRelated: Severe childhood obesity is on the rise in the U.S.\n\nIt’s recommended that people get 150 minutes (or two and half hours) of exercise each week, based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical authorities. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. (Experts often encourage recreational athletes to not exercise more than an hour a day.) “In theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,” says O’Donovan.\n\nThis study shows that it doesn’t matter how you decide to split up the recommended weekly amount of exercise. You just need to do it.\n\nHowever, experts caution that it is possible to overdo it, and more exercise than two and a half hours a week can actually be unhelpful and even harmful. One study, published in 2014 in the journal Heart, suggests that in people with existing heart disease, the risk for cardiac arrest and stroke was the same for people who exercised more than an hour a day compared with those who didn’t exercise at all. The coronary heart disease patients who stuck with the recommended 150 minutes a week had the lowest risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nRelated: Post-workout cold immersion likely won’t help you heal\n\nThere are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren’t used to being active. “I would be more concerned about what’s happening at the point of exercise—not the long-term benefits,” says Dr. Howard Andrew Selinger, chair of family medicine at Quinnipiac University. He says someone who is not in good shape is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest or acute injury, such as spraining muscles or putting too much stress on joints.\n\nO’Donovan encourages aspiring weekend warriors to start slowly to avoid any health problems. He says middle-aged adults should exercise moderately during the first 12 weeks and then slowly build up to more vigorous activity.']",Researchers saw an association with physical activity and reduced risk of death when looking at data–they did not prove it’s a direct cause-and-effect relationship.,"This story highlights the findings of a large, longitudinal study conducted in England and Scotland. However, “large” doesn’t mean “conclusive,” which this story seems to indicate.

Treatment usually involves surgical removal of the uterus, known as hysterectomy. At the same time, lymph nodes are often removed to determine the stage of the cancer and whether further treatment is necessary.\n\nThe research team from the Florida Hospital Cancer Institute, in Orlando, reviewed eight prior studies, including nearly 1,600 patients who underwent either an open, closed or robot-assisted hysterectomy and lymph node removal.\n\nIn the open surgery, a relatively large incision is made in the abdominal wall. The closed procedure, known as laparoscopy, requires a much smaller cut, through which small instruments and a video camera are inserted. However, this minimally invasive approach also calls for significant training on the part of the surgeon to overcome challenges such as the counterintuitive movements involved in working from images on a TV monitor.\n\nRobotic-assisted surgery is similar to laparoscopy, only the instruments and cameras are integrated into robotic arms, which the surgeon operates through a control console. The robotic equipment provides better three-dimensional vision, increased range of motion and intuitive, downscaled movements, while adding a few thousand more dollars to the procedure’s price tag, the authors note.\n\n“Also with the computer-enhanced robotic technology, no matter how much coffee you drink in the morning, your movements don’t have tremors,” said Nezhat.\n\nBased on their review, the researchers found that minimally invasive surgeries done with a human hand and instruments or with robotic assistance equipment took around the same time and resulted in similarly long stays in the hospital. However, about half as much blood was lost when robots were enlisted than with standard laparoscopy.\n\nBoth minimally invasive techniques resulted in longer-duration operations than open surgery. But both also led to shorter hospital stays and, in the case of robotic surgery, less blood-loss.\n\nFurther, the average number of lymph nodes removed was about the same in the robotic and open procedures, suggesting that both approaches result in about equal surgeon accuracy in staging endometrial cancer.\n\nNo differences between the three methods were seen in the numbers of complications, report the researchers in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\n“The robot will not really decrease human errors but it will make the surgery easier,” Dr. Tommaso Falcone of the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, who was also not involved in the study, told Reuters Health in an e-mail.\n\n“Robotics increases the chance that a hysterectomy can be done by laparoscopy,” he added. “However, if the surgeon is skilled enough to do the hysterectomy without the robot by laparoscopy then the outcomes will be similar.”\n\nNezhat further noted that while robotic assistance can be a good “enabler” for a minimally invasive approach, surgeons should have at least the basic knowledge of regular laparoscopy too, as there may be times when the robotic equipment doesn’t work.\n\nThe reviewers point out that some of the differences found, such as the longer operation times for robotic-assisted surgery, may be due to surgeons’ inexperience with the new tool and could improve over time.\n\nOn the other hand, the newness of the technology could have deterred surgeons from using it for difficult cases, potentially biasing the results in a positive way for the robotic technique.\n\nRobotic surgery equipment only received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2005. More research is needed to be able to compare long-term outcomes, wrote the researchers.\n\nNezhat advises women to look for a surgeon experienced in doing minimally invasive surgery. If a robot is to be enlisted, he recommends asking how the procedure would be performed if the robot is not available or if it doesn’t work.\n\n“Robotic-assisted surgery is in its infancy, and it definitely has a future,” said Nezhat. “Its benefits should offset its higher costs.”\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/kef67q Obstetrics & Gynecology, December 2010.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Explaining the results of a meta analysis of observational studies is a daunting task and we applaud this story for a credible job.

This success in large animals holds considerable potential for a safe, effective and long-lasting new treatment in humans with the same bleeding disorder.\n\n""Our finding has great clinical relevance for patients with factor VII deficiency,"" said study leader Paris Margaritis, D. Phil., a hematology researcher at the Raymond G. Perelman Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics (CCMT) at The Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). ""These dogs have the type of mutation found in the majority of patients with this disorder, so this approach could lead to a sustained gene therapy in people.""\n\nThe study appeared online Dec. 23 in Blood.\n\nThe Margaritis team collaborated with University of North Carolina (UNC) scientists, led by Tim Nichols, M.D., professor of Medicine and Pathology at the UNC School of Medicine.\n\nFactor VII deficiency is rare, found in about one in 300,000 to one in 500,000 people. Because a gene mutation impairs normal production of a blood clotting factor, patients may suffer excessive bleeding in the central nervous system or GI tract, or after surgery or an injury. Female patients may suffer excessive menstrual bleeding.\n\nFactor VII (FVII) deficiency has a range of severity, with about 40 percent of patients having severe disease. They are most commonly treated with regular infusions of clotting factor. Unlike hemophilia, a better-known bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males, factor VII deficiency strikes males and females equally.\n\nGene therapy proposed for bleeding disorders involves introducing DNA carrying the code to produce the specific clotting factor lacking in patients. Researchers at CHOP and elsewhere have bioengineered an adeno-associated virus (AAV), which does not cause disease, as a vector to deliver DNA into cells where it can express enough factor to make the blood clot normally. Over the past 15 years, CHOP hematology researchers have performed clinical trials of gene therapy for hemophilia B that have helped define efficacy and dosing levels in humans.\n\nThe CCMT at CHOP houses a clinical-grade laboratory that manufactures gene therapy vectors, including the AAV vectors used in the current study. Margaritis, a member of the CHOP group long engaged in hemophilia research, currently leads a laboratory focused on factor VII deficiency as well as hemophilia.\n\n""We developed a unique animal model of this disease after identifying dogs with naturally occurring factor VII deficiency,"" said Margaritis. ""Our investigations enabled us to design the corrective gene to insert into our virus vector in the current study.""\n\nThe CHOP team collaborated with scientists at UNC who have a long-established colony of dogs for hematology research. Based on previous work by Margaritis, the UNC team identified dogs for this gene therapy study.\n\nNichols, the director of UNC\'s Francis Owens Blood Research Laboratory, characterized factor VII deficiency in four individual dogs. Using the AAV vectors supplied by Margaritis, Nichols injected the dogs with varying dosages and monitored their health outcomes and biological markers over several years.\n\nThe treated dogs had expressed levels of clotting factor VII that would be therapeutic in humans, with long-term stability. In one dog, the effects persisted nearly three years. Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses.\n\nThe current study sets the stage for clinical trials in humans. This gene therapy may especially benefit young children with severe bleeding from factor VII deficiency, such as patients receiving care in CHOP\'s hematology program.\n\n""This work is very exciting and promising,"" said Nichols, who added, ""The FVII-deficient dogs tolerated the initial gene therapy infusions very well and have had no adverse side effects over several years of follow up. In other related studies in dogs with hemophilia B, similar positive findings have translated to people with hemophilia B."" Both Nichols and Margaritis agreed: ""The table is now set to propose clinical trials that would treat people who suffer from FVII deficiency.""\n\n###\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (grants HL064190 and HL63098), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Pennsylvania Department of Health supported this study. In addition to his CHOP position, Margaritis is a faculty member at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n""Sustained correction of FVII deficiency in dogs using AAV-mediated expression of zymogen FVII,"" Blood, published online Dec. 23, 2015.']",High marks for this measured news release on an animal study that researchers hope may pave the way for a treatment for a rare bleeding disorder.,"Credit: UC Davis Comparative Oncology Program
This short news release describes a gene therapy experiment in four dogs that might turn out to help human patients with a rare blood disorder known as Factor VII deficiency. The release does a good job of making clear that this is just a proof-of-concept and needs human trials. Great specific language is used to make that clear. But it does not give any context for the problems of developing gene therapies for rare diseases. Companies may balk at developing a treatment than can’t be sold very widely, which contributes to high costs.

Ace this test,"['New research leaves little doubt about it: Fitness is powerful. A new study shows it’s also a powerful predictor of whether an individual will live or die in the next decade.\n\nPut a person on a standard-issue treadmill, crank up the speed and the incline, measure the maximum metabolic equivalents of task she achieves and the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate she can endure, and you have two key bases on which to predict a patient’s 10-year survival prospects, says a study published Monday in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.\n\nThe resulting “FIT Treadmill score,” say researchers from Johns Hopkins University, “is easily attainable from any standardized exercise test and translates basic treadmill performance measures into a fitness-related mortality risk score.”\n\nThe predictor also takes into account a patient’s age and sex. Once computed, the FIT Treadmill score was not improved by taking into account a wide range of measures often used to assess risk, including blood pressure, obesity, cholesterol readings, family history, medication use and the Framingham Risk Score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study plumbed the records of 58,020 patients in the Detroit area who were referred for a stress test because they reported chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or dizziness, among other things. Researchers checked the medical records for a median of 10 years after each stress test to see if a death -- of any cause -- was recorded. A total of 6,456 of these patients, who ranged in age from 18 to 96, died.\n\nLooking back at the treadmill performance of those who lived and those who died, the researchers generated a scale ranging from -200 to 200 to convey an individual’s likelihood of dying of any cause over the next 10 years.\n\n“The notion that being in good physical shape portends lower death risk is by no means new, but we wanted to quantify that risk precisely by age, gender and fitness level, and do so with an elegantly simple equation that requires no additional fancy testing beyond the standard stress test,” says lead investigator Dr. Haitham Ahmed, a cardiology fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nPatients with a score between 100 and 200 have a 98% likelihood of surviving the next decade, the researchers said. Those with scores between 0 and 100 have a 97% probability of survival. Patients who turn in a performance yielding a score between 0 and -100 have an 89% likelihood of 10-year survival. And those with a score between -100 and -200 have a 62% probability of surviving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProbabilities may not grab all patients by the collar. But telling someone he or she has a better than 1-in-3 chance of dying before the next decade’s out (or even a better than 1-in-10 chance) would probably be a sobering reminder to hit the gym. The authors said the metric “can be used to communicate fitness-related risk and motivate behavioral change after exercise stress testing.”\n\nDo-it-yourself stress testing is probably not very reliable, since a physician or sports physiologist needs to be around to decide when to call a halt to the test (and therefore what maximum a test-taker has achieved).\n\nBut if you think you’d like to try, and can do a relatively simple computation, you can use the metabolic equivalents (METS) and the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate (%MPHR), which are both available on most cardio machines at the gym, to calculate your own survival prospects. Here’s the magic formula:\n\nFIT Treadmill Score = %MPHR + 12 (METS) - 4 (age) + 43 (if female)\n\nFat? Fit? Flummoxed? Yeah, me too.

Doctors can try to treat glioblastoma with surgery to remove the cancerous cells, and blast them with radiation and chemotherapy. However, as the disease spreads, it becomes difficult to differentiate healthy brain cells from cancerous glioblastoma stem cells, and the condition is therefore almost impossible to completely remove.\n\nGetty Images\n\nRead more: New prostate cancer DNA spit test developed by scientists\n\nEach year, glioblastoma kills around 15,000 adults in the U.S. The condition recently made headlines as the disease that killed senator John McCain at the age of 81. Symptoms include recurring headaches, loss of appetite, blurred vision, vomiting, shifts in personality and the ability to learn, seizures and the gradual loss of speech.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n“Thus, development of an effective therapy to kill glioblastoma stem cells is urgently needed,” Dr. Pei-Yong Shi, professor of genetics at the University of Texas Medical Branch and author of the study published in the journal mBio told Newsweek.\n\nAs both the Zika virus and glioblastoma can affect the brain, the team hypothesized that the former could be harnessed to treat the latter.\n\nIn 2015, countries in the Americas, including Brazil, as well as parts of Africa, were hit by a public health crisis following outbreaks of Zika and its link to encephalitis, a condition where the brain becomes swollen.\n\nThe majority of Zika cases result in a mild fever, rash, aches and pains, conjunctivitis and a headache. But if a pregnant woman becomes infected, the virus can target neural progenitor cells in her fetus, putting the infant at risk of being born with microcephaly. This is where the head develops smaller than normal.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe study showed that a live-attenuated Zika vaccine (containing a weakened version of the virus that does not cause disease in humans) could selectively infect and kill human glioblastoma stem cells, explained Shi. That’s because glioblastoma stem cells have similar properties to neural stem cells.\n\nTo investigate whether ZIKV-LAV, a vaccine developed at the University of Texas shown to protect mice and non-human primates against the virus, could kill human glioblastoma stem cells, the scientists injected a combination of glioblastoma stem cells from two human donors and the vaccine into mice.\n\nThe animals dosed only with the stem cells developed tumors. But those injected with the combination lived to around 50 days, 20 days longer than the stem cell mice.\n\nWhen the team sequenced the RNA (a molecule that helps with gene expressions) of glioblastoma stem cells exposed to the vaccine and then those which weren’t, they found the virus prompted an antiviral reaction in the exposed cells in what is known as an oncolytic response.\n\nBefore undergoing surgery, cancer patients could be given the Zika vaccine to ""let the viruses hunt down the GSCs [glioblastoma stem cells] and eliminate them,” said virologist Dr. Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, who worked on the study.\n\nShi said: “Scientists may turn the \'bad\' side of a devastating pathogen—Zika virus—for potential cancer therapy.”\n\nHowever, he cautioned any potential treatment which could emerge from the study is far from being rolled out.\n\n“We still need to further improve the specificity of the cancer-killing ability, while retain the safety of the vaccine strain,” Shi explained. “For example, we need to make sure that the therapeutic vaccine virus does not infect and kill normal neurons in humans.”\n\nDr. Harry Bulstrode, brain tumor expert funded by the charity Cancer Research U.K. who is researching how Zika could be used to treat aggressive brain tumors, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek: ""This study is another interesting piece in the jigsaw, but it is never going to demonstrate what we believe to be the really exciting properties of the virus. These are its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and to selectively infect and concentrate in the brain tumor stem cells left behind after surgery.""']","The story does express some limitations of the study findings, which we appreciate.","This story reports results from a study in which researchers deployed a Zika virus vaccine to target and kill human glioblastoma brain cancer stem cells, which had been transplanted into mice. Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant form of primary brain tumor, and has most recently been in the news as the disease that killed Senator John McCain. It is incurable despite aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Median survival time is less than 2 years.
The story does express some limitations of the study findings, which we appreciate. But given how preliminary this evidence was, we think there was room for improvement–especially in the headline (no mention of mice) and when countering some speculation about how the virus might “hunt” down cancer in people.

It is the most common cause of job-related disability. Low back pain affects men and women equally.\n\nMost back pain is short-term, but about 20 percent of people affected by acute low back pain go on to develop chronic low back pain lasting a year or more. A compressed and herniated disk, in which the rubbery cushion between vertebrae impinges on and irritates nearby nerves, is a major cause of low back pain that can radiate to the legs.\n\n""The nerve root is a sensitive structure that when pinched becomes inflamed and causes pain,"" said lead investigator Alessandro Napoli M.D., Ph.D., an interventional radiologist at Sapienza University of Rome. ""The body reacts with muscle constriction, which decreases the distance between vertebrae, and a vicious cycle is created.""\n\nThe single-center prospective study included 80 patients experiencing at least three months of low back pain due to a herniated disk that had not responded to conservative treatments including exercise and medication.\n\nThe patients underwent a minimally invasive interventional radiology procedure in which, with the help of CT imaging, a needle is guided to the location of the bulging disc and nerve root. A probe is then inserted through the needle tip and delivers pulsed radiofrequency energy to the area over a 10-minute period. Even without touching the disc, the pulsation serves to resolve the herniation.\n\n""The probe delivers a gentle electrical energy, so there\'s no thermal damage,"" Dr. Napoli said. ""The results have been extraordinary. Patients have been relieved of pain and resumed their normal activities within a day.""\n\nOf the 80 patients treated, 81 percent were pain free one year after a single 10-minute treatment session. Six patients required a second pulsed radiofrequency session. Ninety percent of the patients were able to avoid surgical treatment.\n\n""Following this treatment, inflammation and pain go away. With relaxation of the muscles, the distance between the vertebrae returns,"" Dr. Napoli explained.\n\nDr. Napoli said no patients experienced side effects after receiving the minimally invasive outpatient treatment.\n\n""There\'s a big gap between conservative treatments for disc compression and herniation and surgical repair, which can lead to infection, bleeding and a long recovery period,"" Dr. Napoli said.

Try Diet and Exercise Instead,"['Many Americans would rather take a drug than change their habits to control a persistent ailment. Yet, every medication has side effects, some of which can be worse than the disease they are meant to treat. Drugs considered safe when first marketed can turn out to have hazards, both bothersome and severe, that become apparent only after millions of people take them for a long enough time.\n\nSuch is the case with a popular class of drugs called proton pump inhibitors, or P.P.I.s, now used by more than 15 million Americans and many more people worldwide to counter an increasingly common ailment: acid reflux, which many people refer to as heartburn or indigestion.\n\nThese medications are now linked to a growing number of complications, ranging in seriousness from nutrient deficiencies, joint pain and infections to bone fractures, heart attacks and dementia. While definitive evidence for most of the risks identified thus far is lacking, consumers plagued by acid reflux would be wise to consider an alternative approach, namely diet and lifestyle changes that can minimize symptoms and even heal damage already done.\n\nAcid reflux is more than just a nuisance. It involves the backward flow of stomach acid into the tissues above it. It results when the lower esophageal sphincter, a ring of muscle between the esophagus and the stomach, fails to close tightly enough to prevent the contents of the stomach from moving up instead of down. Sometimes the upper sphincter, between the esophagus and the throat, malfunctions as well.']","It conflates occasional acid reflux (or gastroesophageal reflux, which can cause heartburn) with the more serious problem of GERD, which also can cause heartburn.","This story focuses on “heartburn” and lifestyle changes that can reduce the likelihood of it and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
We were pleased with the way the story focused on non-drug options for a common condition. We often see news stories that do the opposite, prioritizing drugs and skipping over alternatives, such as dietary changes, that may be just as effective and carry fewer risks.
But, this story may leave readers confused. It conflates occasional acid reflux (or gastroesophageal reflux, which can cause heartburn) with the more serious problem of GERD, which can also cause heartburn.

More research is needed to determine just how effective a peptide can be in helping humans beat the flu.\n\n""We have identified a potentially new treatment for H1N1 human influenza virus, which is a peptide that comes from the skin of a frog from southern India,"" said Joshy Jacob , an associate professor in the Emory University School of Medicine\'s microbiology and immunology department, who led the study.\n\nThe peptide, named urumin, specifically targets H1 flu viruses, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal Immunity\n\n""This peptide works by directly killing the virus, and it is specific for all influenza viruses that have a H1 type of hemagglutinin,"" Jacob said.\n\nHemagglutinin is a spike-shaped protein found on the surface of flu viruses. For the viruses to make you sick, the spikes of hemagglutinin attach to your cells to infect them.\n\n\'It makes the virus particle fall apart\'\n\nFor the study, skin secretions were collected from 15 frogs, of the species Hydrophylax bahuvistara , which are about the size of a tennis ball and brightly colored. Peptides were then gathered from their secretions.\n\nA Hydrophylax bahuvistara frog in its native environment in southern India.\n\nThe researchers observed how the peptides interacted with influenza viruses under a microscope and in mice.\n\n""In this paper we screened 32 peptides, and the surprise was that four out of 32 had activity against the virus,"" Jacob said.\n\n""Out of the four, we found one of them (urumin) was non-toxic to human cells,"" he said. ""So, we tested it against viruses that came from the 1930s until the current ones, and it kills all of the H1s. It doesn\'t touch H3. It\'s very, very specific.""\n\nProfessor Joshy Jacob, in middle, seen with his colleagues David Holthausen (on left) and Song Hee Lee (on right).\n\nThe researchers aren\'t quite sure why urumin only targets H1 viruses, but Jacob said that H1 viruses might be anatomically similar to an amphibian pathogen that the frog mucus is intended to destroy. If there is a similarity, it may explain why H1 viruses are vulnerable to urumin\'s wrath.\n\n""The frog makes this peptide for its own survival. It never gets influenza,"" Jacob said, adding that the peptide fights the flu virus by destroying an important part of the hemagglutinin.\n\nTo explain how the peptide works, Jacob likened hemagglutinin to a billboard sign.\n\n""You have the message and then you have the little stem that holds it up. The message can change but the stem is the same, and this peptide targets the stem of the hemagglutinin, that\'s why it\'s very efficient,"" he said.\n\nA side-by-side electron microscope image of a flu virus before and after being exposed to the urumin peptide.\n\nThe urumin peptide could be a novel treatment since it targets the hemagglutinin, unlike current drugs on the market which target other parts of the virus, resulting in less impact, Jacob said.\n\n""It just blows it up. It makes the virus particle fall apart,"" he said.\n\nGregory Chinchar, a professor in the University of Mississippi Medical Center\'s department of microbiology and immunology, said that he was surprised that the peptide targeted the hemagglutinin on the flu virus. He was not involved in the new study.\n\n""I don\'t think people thought that they work that way before,"" Chinchar said about the peptide. ""They thought that they would be more targeted to membranes, but the data looks like they target the H1 protein specifically and that data looks pretty firm.""\n\nThe history of \'milking\' frog skin\n\nIt was first discovered that frogs had a special way of warding off bacteria and other pathogens in ancient Russia, when live Russian Brown frogs were dropped into milk to keep the milk from going sour, according to the American Chemical Society\n\n""The milk stayed good, just like you refrigerated it,"" Jacob said about the age-old Russian practice.\n\n""In 2012, scientists took that particular frog and wanted to know why is it, why do these frogs keep milk fresh? It turned out that when you shock a frog or when you stimulate them or stress them, they secrete these short peptides into their surroundings,"" he said.

Humans have long known that frogs come equipped with protective chemicals to maintain froggy health.  This story describes a study of a single peptide from the mucus of a frog from India that lays waste to the H1 subtype of the influenza A virus–at least in the laboratory.
The story does an admirable job of explaining how the peptide kills the virus, provides good contextual comments from independent sources, and repeatedly reminds readers that testing in humans is yet to be accomplished. While we generally think preclinical research is too early to be of much use to a wide audience, the details here make this less about a hapless “new study proves xyz” and more about the scientific process of finding new tools against the flu.
On the flip side, the story is not helped by the headline, which leaves the question of applicability to humans quite open.

Reporting online today in International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, the research team describes their results, which provide a proof of concept for efforts to develop implant technology to return the sense of smell to those who have lost it.\n\n“Our work shows that smell restoration technology is an idea worth studying further,” said corresponding author Eric Holbrook, MD, Chief of Rhinology at Mass. Eye and Ear and associate professor of otolaryngology at Harvard Medical School. “The development of cochlear implants, for example, didn’t really accelerate until someone placed an electrode in the cochlea of a patient and found that the patient heard a frequency of some type.”\n\nSmell loss, or anosmia, has an estimated prevalence of 5 percent of the general population. While some cases of anosmia may be treated by caring for an underlying cause (often nasal obstruction, in which odors can’t reach the nerves of the olfactory system due to swelling, polyps or sinus disease), other cases involving damage to the sensory nerves of the nose (i.e. head injury, viruses and aging) are much more complex. There are currently no proven therapies for these cases.\n\nOur sense of smell not only contributes to our enjoyment of life, but also to our daily safety and well being. We rely on our sense of smell to make us aware of smoke in detecting a fire, natural gas leaks and to avoid eating rotten food. In the elderly, of whom there are estimates that greater than 50 percent of the population over the age of 65 has experienced smell loss, it can be difficult to get proper nutrition, as the sensation of flavor is closely tied to the sense of smell, and as flavor diminishes, appetite decreases in this population.\n\nA Cochlear Implant for the Nose\n\nMotivated by work conducted by research colleagues at Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Medicine, Mass. Eye and Ear physicians wanted to address the question of whether electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb could induce the sense of smell in human subjects.\n\nThe findings described in the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology report demonstrate this feasibility. In the report, the researchers describe endoscopic procedures to position electrodes in the sinus cavities of five patients with an intact ability to smell. Three patients described sensations of smell (including reports of onions, antiseptic, sour and fruity aromas) as a result of the stimulation.\n\nThis breakthrough in human patients opens the door for a “cochlear implant for the nose” to be developed — though the study authors caution that the concept of an olfactory stimulator is more challenging than existing technologies. The most successful neuroprosthesic device in the world, cochlear implants have been on the market for more than three decades to electrically stimulate the auditory nerve to restore hearing in people with profound hearing loss.\n\n“There’s currently so little that we can do for these patients, and we hope to eventually be able to reestablish smell in people who don’t have a sense of smell,” Dr. Holbrook said. “Now we know that electrical impulses to the olfactory bulb can provide a sense of smell — and that’s encouraging.”\n\nIn addition to Dr. Holbrook, authors on the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology study include co-first author Sidharth V. Puram, MD, PhD, of Washington University School of Medicine, Reiner B. See, MD, and Aaron G. Tripp, of Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dinesh G.

They came with ""horrible"" side effects, he said, and so he rarely took them.\n\nAs a blood pressure monitor squeezed snugly around his arm, the pharmacist counseled Thomas, 49, on his diet and stress level while checking his blood pressure. She then helped Thomas find a medication better suited for his body.\n\nThomas was not at a health clinic or pharmacy or a primary care physician\'s office.\n\nHe was at the barbershop where he works in Inglewood, California. As part of a study, these health services were provided at his barbershop and others across Los Angeles County.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine , tested whether pharmacist-led programs in barbershops could significantly lower high blood pressure in black men in the United States.\n\nResults from six months after the study, published in March , showed that when the guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure level of less than 130/80 was achieved among 63.6% of men who participated in the study\'s program, versus 11.7% of those who didn\'t.\n\nResults from 12 months after the study show that when guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure measurement of less than 130/80 was achieved by 68% of men who participated in the study program, versus 11% of those who didn\'t.\n\nJUST WATCHED Check, change, and control your blood pressure Replay More Videos ...

Levels in between are considered at risk.\n\n""The first number, called systolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart beats,"" the CDC says. ""The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart rests between beats.""\n\nMany older black men tend to avoid seeing the doctor until they have a serious health problem, and then they ""use the emergency room as a doctor,"" Thomas said.\n\n""If it wasn\'t for the program, a lot of guys wouldn\'t have known they had high blood pressure,"" he said of the study. ""Unfortunately, I wish we had other programs to come in, too.""\n\nOn the other hand, the barbershop represents a safe haven in the black community -- a no-judgment zone -- where conversations about health and other personal topics are commonplace.\n\nAs a barber, ""we know more about our customers than their spouses do,"" Thomas said.\n\nShape your hair and your blood pressure\n\nThe prevalence of high blood pressure among black adults in the United States is among the highest in the world, according to the American Heart Association .

The pharmacists could prescribe drug therapy under a collaborative agreement with the men\'s doctors.\n\nAt his barbershop, Thomas said, many customers were hesitant to open up to the pharmacists and doctors and to meet with them for health consultations.\n\n""No one wanted to do it,"" he said. ""But by them being there -- they were in there every day -- and then we got used to them, and they warmed up to everybody. ... Then a lot of guys eventually were like, \'I\'ll go.

""Since the barbershop is a place where men want to be, it\'s a place that\'s known for open collegial conversation, it really is a perfect place to relay health messages that are important for black men.""\n\nThe history of barbershops as havens for health\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIn the years to come, as racial segregation laws limited the spaces where black Americans could gather, the barbershop served as a safe meeting space for the black community.

The story is strong and scores well because it discusses critical data from the study, offers comments from independent sources and provides information on limitations.

People suffering from it often deal with a lifetime of painful symptoms. A new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a long-term solution for those dealing with the dry, itchy and painful skin that comes with chronic eczema. The trial uses a cream containing beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria on the skin. While it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria, experts say this approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin.\n\n""There are over 1,000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin, some that even produce natural antibiotics. However, we know that eczema patients lack the beneficial bacteria needed to kill Staph aureus, harmful bacteria that can worsen eczema,"" said Donald Leung, MD, head of the Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology at National Jewish Health.\n\nTo fight harmful bacteria, researchers isolate beneficial bacteria from our skin and grow it in a lab. It is then applied to eczema patients\' skin as a lotion twice a day for a week. Bacterial DNA from patients\' skin is then analyzed in a lab to determine if the cream effectively reduced the amount of bad bacteria present.\n\n""Ideally, we want to eliminate all staph aureus from the skin of eczema patients,"" said Leung. ""What the cream does is help the skin gain back its natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy.""\n\nResearchers hope that using the bacteria-infused cream will offer a long-term solution where other treatments fall short. Powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema, but they kill good bacteria on patients\' skin along with the bad. Creams containing corticosteroids are also often prescribed to eczema patients, but they come with harsh side effects, and patients usually can\'t tolerate them for long periods of time.\n\n""The worst symptom of eczema is the itching and the scratching, and the more you scratch, the more it spreads. It can be very painful,"" said Cassandra Rodriguez, 33, who has struggled with eczema all her life.\n\nCassandra has tried just about every cream and medication on the market, and says when she learned about the clinical trial, she was on board to give it a try.\n\n""The trial coordinator explained that it\'s like a probiotic for your skin,"" said Rodriguez. ""You hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut, so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin.""\n\nCassandra\'s son also has eczema, and she\'s hoping this research will lead to an effective treatment so that he won\'t have to suffer with the pain and embarrassment of the disease for as long as she has. ""He\'s little now, but dealing with eczema as a teen and an adult is really difficult,"" said Rodriguez. ""If there were something on the market that could help him and help everyone suffering with eczema every day, that would be amazing.""\n\nExperts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream. The next steps involve testing those different combinations, ensuring they\'re safe and conducting a longer trial to see if the benefits of bacterial cream can truly provide a permanent solution for eczema patients.\n\n###\n\nAbout National Jewish Health:\n\nNational Jewish Health is the leading respiratory hospital in the nation.

The premise of this research is that introducing “good bacteria” might decrease the population of Staphlococcus aureus —  a bacterium that’s part of the normal flora of our skin and respiratory tract, and speculated to play a role in making eczema worse.
But as with many treatments based on the microbiome, the benefits are touted with language that — although it sounds reasonable and appealing — is not backed by existing research. In fact, here there is no research. The sponsors are still recruiting volunteers for the trial. That should have been made more clear.
The news release does explain why a less toxic alternative might have advantages over existing therapies such as antibiotics and corticosteroids.

But since its approval in 2002, women using the device have sent the FDA more than 5,000 complaints, ranging from pain and menstrual problems to pregnancies and even deaths.\n\nSome of the complaints related to the placement of the device.\n\nIn a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU), sound waves emitted from a probe placed in vagina help a physician check if Essure has been placed properly.\n\nThis test is an alternative to the generally-prescribed modified hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test in which an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes is used to check for proper device placement.\n\nA woman using Essure must do a test to confirm that the device is properly placed within three months of the procedure and until she receives a confirmation from her doctor, she must use alternate birth control methods, Bayer said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAll physicians who offer Essure are expected to be trained to perform the TVU confirmation test by mid-2016, the company said.\n\nThe training will start in September, the same month the FDA will hold a public panel meeting to discuss the safety and effectiveness of Essure.']",This story related to the controversial Essure contraception device lacked most of the basic information that would allow readers to evaluate the procedure being discussed.,"This article describes FDA approval of transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) as an alternative test method to confirm the proper placement of the Essure permanent contraception device. The test, like the currently used hysterosalpingogram (HSG), must be performed three months after placement of the device. The announcement by Bayer Healthcare, and Reuters’ incurious report on the announcement, do little to inform readers about the risks associated with the device and how the TVU procedure might reduce those risks. As we recently noted in a review of a Bayer Healthcare news release that reported on the tardy post-market safety assessment of Essure, numerous harms have been reported by women implanted with Essure. Improper placement of the device is a factor contributing to those harms. But there is no explanation in the article about the difference between HSG and TVU in terms of costs, benefits or harms. And there is no discussion of the evidence that led to the FDA approval.

Studies have shown that people in parts of the world who eat more fish have lower rates of heart disease, and fewer heart attacks (though the same can’t necessarily be true of those who take supplements—see this piece “Fish Oil Is Hugely Popular—But Should You Take It? for more on that).\n\nOne thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack. Can omega-3 fat provide similar benefit? Researchers led by Dr. Raymond Kwong at Brigham and Women’s Hospital wanted to find out, so they took advantage of more sophisticated imaging techniques that can provide detailed pictures of the heart and how it’s changing in the days and weeks after a heart attack.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nFor the study, published in the journal Circulation, they studied nearly 360 people who recently had a heart attack, who were randomly assigned to take 4g of omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo pill for six months. (That’s a high dose; a 3 oz. portion of salmon contains anywhere from half a gram to 1g of omega-3.) Every two months, the volunteers came in for an MRI of their heart to track how much the muscle was changing.\n\nNormally after a heart attack, part of the heart is starved of oxygen, and that portion never recovers. The remaining healthy tissue starts to compensate for the compromised tissue, but has to work harder to maintain the heart’s normal pumping function. Over time, this overworking can lead to scar tissue and start to restrict even the healthy tissue’s ability to do its job.\n\nKwong and his team found that people taking the high dose of omega-3 fats showed 6% less of this decline in heart function than those taking placebo. What’s more, the people who showed the highest blood levels of the omega-3 fats (people absorb it at different rates) showed the greatest reduction in scarring — 13% — compared to those with the lowest levels. The effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs, including cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medications.\n\n“The omega-3 fatty acids seem to be preventing scarring of the otherwise healthy muscle that now has to overwork because of the heart attack,” says Kwong.\n\nBased on analysis of their blood samples, the people taking omega-3 supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack.\n\nIt’s the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart after a heart attack; the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved, the stronger the heart will be.\n\nKwong says that the findings are only the first step toward considering whether omega-3 fatty acid supplements should be part of every emergency heart attack response. The 4g is a high dose; previous studies in which people were given 1g of fish oil were more inconsistent. Most of the people also started taking the supplements two to four weeks after their heart attack. Might they have benefit more if they had started taking the supplements sooner? How much omega-3 is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way?\n\nThese are questions Kwong and others hope to answer with more studies. Kwong collected blood samples from the volunteers and will be studying them for hints about how omega-3 fatty acids are working in the body after a heart attack. “To say every [heart attack] patient should be taking omega-3 fatty acids right away is a bit premature,” he says. “But I do think it’s logical that our results hold promise, and may reduce bad outcomes in patients after a heart attack.”\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.']","The study results are intriguing, but also come with important limitations, such as a high drop-out rate that could have skewed the findings.","In a randomized controlled trial studying fish oil versus placebo, a very modest improvement in heart health markers was observed in people prescribed fish oil. This TIME article demonstrates a good understanding of the study’s novelty, which appears to be among the first to look at potential benefits of fish oil in patients who have just had a heart attack.
However, the story missed the mark in several ways: It didn’t mention the potential harms of taking fish oil if you’re a post-heart attack patient, nor did it discuss costs of the intervention. The only person quoted is the lead researcher of the study–an independent source was needed. Lastly, several limitations of the study are not discussed, including that many patients did not return for post-treatment follow-up.

It's the latest mind-body technique -- including yoga, acupuncture and meditation-based therapies -- to be found effective in reducing menopause symptoms. (Corbis)\n\nWomen sweltering under a plague of hot flashes might consider an old strategy to reduce their misery, says new research: harnessing the power of suggestion. Clinical hypnosis that prompted women to chill in the face of hot flashes was highly effective, says a new study, driving down both the number and the severity of episodes that women suffered and improving sleep quality and the extent to which the episodes interfered with daily life.\n\nThe post-menopausal women in this trial suffered at least eight hot flashes a day -- as many as 50 a week.\n\nAlthough hormone replacement therapy has been found highly effective in reducing the physical symptoms that accompany midlife hormonal changes, its safety for all women is widely debated. The landmark Women's Health Initiative study suggested that treatments that combine estrogen and progesterone might raise a woman's likelihood of dementia, stroke and breast cancer. Other medications used to treat hot flashes -- the blood-pressure medication clonidine, the antidepressant paroxetine and the anti-seizure medication gapapentin -- can have unacceptable side effects as well.\n\nHypnosis, by contrast, comes with no known risks. It is among the many non-drug treatments to which women turn for hot flash relief. In trials, the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM) has found that yoga, acupuncture, qi gong and some meditation-based therapies can be effective in reducing menopausal symptoms. But black cohosh, an herbal supplement, has proved largely ineffective.\n\nThe latest research, published online in the journal Menopause, compared the effects of five 45-minute sessions of therapeutic hypnosis with those of a placebo treatment in which a therapist listened attentively to a subject's complaints for five sessions. For the 93 post-menopausal women who got the hypnosis treatment, the sessions included hypnotic induction, instructions for self-hypnosis and specific suggestions for mental imagery that would conjure the comforting sensations of coolness, relaxation and safe places.\n\nOn several measures, including a gauge of skin-conductance that detected a rise in body temperature, the subjects who got the hypnotherapy sessions experienced a marked improvement in their experience of menopausal symptoms.\n\nThe frequency of hot flashes in the hypnotherapy group dropped by 48% at six weeks and 56% at 12 weeks, compared to drops of 7% and 13% at six and 12 weeks, respectively, among those in the trial's control condition. A measure of the severity and frequency of hot flashes showed an average 71% improvement in the hypnosis group at six weeks versus 8% in the control group -- and an 80% improvement at the 12-week mark among the women who got hypnosis versus 15% at 12 weeks.\n\nHypnotherapy also reduced hot flashes measured by electrodes that showed changes in skin conductance that would be seen with hot flashes. At six weeks, women in the hypnotherapy group had 41% fewer hot flashes than at the outset and 57% fewer hot flashes at 12 weeks, while those in the control group experienced a slight rise in hot flashes at six week and a 10% drop at 12 weeks.""]",Better than the ,"This story uses absolute reduction numbers to quantify the benefits of therapeutic hypnosis, which gives a more helpful perspective of the study’s findings. It also does a good job in comparing the various alternatives available for postmenopausal women suffering from hot flashes. However, we yearned for some expert perspective to give context to the numbers.

Many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin, and as an alternative to painkillers.\n\nIt\'s a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis. But there\'s a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions.\n\nAdvocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. Another study, published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments.\n\nThe research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids - Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers - and heroin, though. Many medical professionals say there\'s not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it.\n\nIn Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a years-long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck. Tired of feeling ""like a zombie,"" the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. Ham gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control and she hasn\'t gone back on the opioids.\n\n""Before, I couldn\'t even function. I couldn\'t get anything done,"" Ham said. ""Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy.""\n\nBolstered by stories like Ham\'s, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot.\n\nAuthorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody.\n\n""I don\'t think it\'s a cure for everybody,"" said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. ""But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it\'s working?""\n\nMost states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment.\n\nThis month, Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Sen. Mike Vereb, a Republican, called on lawmakers to take on what he called ""the number-one killer in Pennsylvania"" - opioid abuse.\n\n""Opioid abuse has no party, has no color, has no religion,"" Vereb said. ""Let\'s face it, that\'s the killer. What we\'re doing today is the healer.""\n\n""It\'s hard to argue against anecdotal evidence when you are in the middle of a crisis,"" said Patricia Hymanson, a York, Maine, neurologist who has taken a leave of absence to serve in the state House. ""But if you do too many things too fast, you are sometimes left with problems on the other end.""\n\nNo place immune to America\'s opioid epidemic\n\nIn New Hampshire, where drug deaths more than doubled last year from 2011 levels, the Senate last week rejected efforts to decriminalize marijuana.\n\nThere are some promising findings involving rats and one 2014 JAMA study showing that states with medical marijuana laws had nearly 25 percent fewer opioid-related overdose deaths than those without, but even a co-author on that study said it would be wrong to use the findings to make the case for cannabis as a treatment option.\n\n""We are in the midst of a serious problem. People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,"" said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\nCannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School\'s Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution.\n\n""If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,"" he said. ""However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction.""\n\nThe findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data.\n\nSubstance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. But supporters point to doctors like Dr. Gary Witman, of Canna Care Docs, who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in Fall River, Stoughton and Worcester, Massachusetts. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids. None have relapsed.\n\n""When I see them in a six-month follow up, they are much more focused,"" Witman said. ""They have greater respect. They feel better about themselves. Most importantly, I\'m able to get them back to gainful employment.""']","The story relies heavily on anecdotes, and while these personal stories are weighed against the perspectives of outside researchers, with much research being cited, we are never given needed details on what that research contains.","This relatively thorough story discusses a major question: If we can substitute one drug (in this case, marijuana) for others that have a high risk of abuse, especially opioid painkillers.

This therapy has recently been highlighted by several professional football players traveling to Europe for treatment. The process works by using one's own blood – specifically the body's own anti-inflammatory proteins and human-growth elements – to end or ease pain and chronic injuries.\n\nRecently a well-known Seattle Seahawks player and four of his teammates are sitting out a week of training camp to receive a blood-healing treatment from a European supplier an IRAP-based treatment solution. Other NBA, MLB and NHL superstars have also utilized the treatment.\n\nThis treatment was developed by a German physician, Dr. Peter Wehling, in the 1980s. By using one's own blood – specifically the body's own anti-inflammatory proteins and human-growth elements – to end or ease pain and chronic injuries. During the process, blood is drawn from the patient and then injected back into the pained joint.\n\nA European company and their U.S. affiliate started using IRAP to treat joint pain from inflammation in the 1980s; the price reported was $10,000. The European-based process was the inspiration for Dr. Barreto of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to work on developing a stronger, more effective, and more cost-efficient version in the United States.\n\nAfter years of development and process optimization, the U.S. product IRAPjoint™ is now ready. Significantly better concentration, healing/pain reduction durability, faster production (just one hour), one-fifth the price, and chemical additive free, IRAPjoint™ is now available in multiple physician practices throughout the United States.\n\nIRAPjoint™ is produced through a single blood draw which is enough for a full year's treatment of up to 12 injections. Typically, the treatment process is painless and just takes a few minutes and consists of one injection per week for three weeks, followed by quarterly injections, as needed. Success has been achieved in knees, hip and shoulder joints.\n\nFinally, a U.S. based company has a solution for America's professional and weekend athletes as well as those struggling with aching or arthritic joints. It's a non-drug, non-surgical treatment derived from your own blood. The cost of the USA-based IRAPjoint™ treatment is $2,000 compared to the reported price of $10,000 for a foreign competitor.\n\nFor clinical or PR inquiries, please call (405) 400-0680.

The therapy, called IRAPjoint, consists of withdrawing a patient’s blood, heating it, and then re-injecting it into the painful joint.
The theory behind this practice, which has been done for several years in Europe, is that heat increases the number of anti-inflammatory proteins (also called anti-inflammatory cytokines) in the blood, which then combat inflammation at the re-injection site. While increasingly popular with professional athletes (and horses), there is little actual scientific evidence that this treatment works. Anecdotal evidence can be important, and for top athletes whose careers depend on healthy joints, the gamble and steep price tag may be worth it.

The medication is not available yet, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing it for possible approval, the researchers said.\n\nIn the United States, about 10 percent of people say they have chronic insomnia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are sleep aids on the market, but they do not work for everyone and they can have side effects that include sleepwalking, daytime drowsiness and confusion.\n\nSuvorexant works differently from those drugs, zeroing in on specific brain chemicals involved in the ability to sleep, explained study author Dr. William Herring, executive director of clinical research at Merck.\n\nThe study, published online Nov. 28 and in the Dec. 4 print issue of the journal Neurology, included 254 healthy adults with primary insomnia, which means it wasn\'t caused by an underlying physical or mental health problem.\n\nAll of the patients spent four weeks on one of four doses of suvorexant and another four weeks on placebo pills. They had their sleep monitored in a sleep lab on their first night with each treatment, and then came back again after four weeks.\n\nOverall, Herring\'s team found, people slept better with the drug, although the improvement was not dramatic.\n\nAt the outset, when patients spent eight hours in bed, they were typically asleep for 66 percent of that time. One day on suvorexant boosted that by anywhere from 5 percent to 13 percent, relative to the placebo. Between 21 and 37 fewer minutes were spent awake during those sleep periods.\n\nThere was still a benefit four weeks later. One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small.\n\n""The amount of additional sleep was not tremendous,"" said Dr. Carl Bazil, director of the division of epilepsy and sleep at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nThe effect was essentially comparable to what has been seen with other sleep medications, said Bazil, who was not involved in the research.\n\nBut, he said, suvorexant is seen as a potentially important development in the world of sleep medicine, because the drug blocks specific brain chemicals called orexins, which help keep people awake. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects.\n\n""The way [suvorexant] works makes a lot of sense,"" Bazil said. ""The hope is that it will help some people who haven\'t responded to [other drugs], and have fewer side effects.""\n\nIt\'s promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study.\n\nThe most common side effects were sleepiness (reported by about 10 percent of patients on the two higher doses of suvorexant), headache (reported by about 5 percent), dizziness and abnormal dreams (5 percent).\n\nThere are still many questions, including whether the drug would benefit people with insomnia due to a health condition, which doctors call secondary insomnia.\n\nThe study also excluded adults aged 65 or older -- an age group commonly affected by insomnia. But, Herring said, seniors were part of a larger, 12-month trial, and Merck has submitted those results to the FDA.\n\nAnother sleep specialist said the findings show ""some potential benefit"" from suvorexant, but he cautioned insomnia sufferers against relying completely on any drug.\n\n""Medication can be important,"" said Dr. William Kohler, who directs the Florida Sleep Institute in Spring Hill. ""But in the long run, the best methods for treating insomnia are behavioral techniques.""\n\nKohler said cognitive behavioral therapy -- where people learn to change the thoughts and habits that affect their sleep quality -- is a proven way to manage insomnia. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix.\n\nBazil agreed: ""I look at most people with insomnia as someone who developed bad sleep habits.""\n\nA drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said. ""But those bad sleep habits -- you\'ve got to address them too,"" he added.\n\n""The problem,"" Kohler noted, ""is that we don\'t want to make behavior changes. We want to pop a pill.""\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about insomnia and good sleep habits from the National Sleep Foundation.']",This story did a lot of things admirably.  The use of independent experts was the most important factor in the story.,"We thought the explanation of results was handled awkwardly.  But for the most part, this story addressed most of our criteria and deserves a four-star score.

In the United States, physicians diagnose more than 10,000 cases each year. While more than 4,000 American women die of the disease each year, the mortality rate has dropped more than 50 percent in the past four decades, largely due to the advent of well-organized screening and diagnostic programs.\n\nWhile the Pap smear can be performed by a non-specialist, colposcopy requires visualization of the cervix, relying on highly trained professionals and expensive equipment that is not easily accessible to underserved populations. These factors make cervical cancer more prevalent in women living in low socioeconomic communities.\n\nIn a new paper published on May 31 in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Duke believe they have found a better way.\n\n""The mortality rate of cervical cancer should absolutely be zero percent because we have all the tools to see and treat it,"" said Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr., Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke. ""But it isn\'t. That is in part because women do not receive screening or do not follow up on a positive screening to have colposcopy performed at a referral clinic. We need to bring colposcopy to women so that we can reduce this complicated string of actions into a single touch point.""\n\nCurrent standard practices for cervical cancer screening require three things: a speculum, a colposcope and a trained professional to administer the test.\n\nThe speculum is a metal device designed to spread the vaginal walls apart. The colposcope is a magnified telescopic device and camera designed to allow medical professionals to look through the speculum to see the cervix, which is located three to six inches inside the vagina. Colposcopes and people who know how to use them are difficult to find in many low-income regions, both domestically and internationally.\n\nRamanujam believes she can replace at least two of these requirements. Her laboratory has developed an all-in-one device that resembles a pocket-sized tampon with lights and a camera at one end. Health providers -- or even women themselves -- are able to capture images of the cervix using the rounded tip of the device to manipulate its position if necessary. The device also includes a channel through which contrast agents used for the cervical cancer screening procedure can be applied.\n\n""We recruited 15 volunteers on Duke\'s campus to try out the new integrated speculum-colposcope design,"" said Mercy Asiedu, a graduate student working on the project in Ramanujam\'s lab. ""Nearly everyone said they preferred it to a traditional speculum and more than 80 percent of the women who tried the device were able to get a good image. Those that couldn\'t felt that they just needed some practice.""\n\nRamanujam and Asiedu are now working on clinical trials to see how their design stacks up against the traditional colposcopy used with a speculum. By using both methods to visualize the cervix, the researchers will be able to make a direct comparison.\n\nAsiedu is also working to automate the screening process. By using image processing and machine learning to teach computers how to spot signs of precancerous and cancerous cells, Asiedu hopes to remove the need for a trained physician at any point in the screening process and shift the task to midwives, community health workers and even the women themselves.\n\n""There have been a few other attempts to come up with a better solution, but none of them have succeeded,"" said Asiedu. ""One design using an inflatable cylinder proved just as uncomfortable as a traditional speculum. Another using directed airflow is just as bulky and expensive as a modern colposcope. With our handheld, low-cost design, we\'re hoping to redefine the entire procedure.""\n\n###\n\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (1R01CA195500, 1R01CA193380).\n\nCITATION: ""Design and Preliminary Analysis of a Vaginal Inserter for Speculum-Free Cervical Cancer Screening,"" Asiedu MN, Agudogo J, Krieger M, Miros, R, Proeschold-Bell, RJ, Schmitt JW, Ramanujam N.

This news release provides some useful background about cervical cancer screening and a new device that might make such screenings more accessible around the globe. However, the release is marred by an incomplete description of the steps involved in cervical cancer screening.
Colposcopy (a test that provides an illuminated, magnified view of the cervix) is done not as a primary screening method as suggested here, but rather as a second step in the screening process when an initial screening test is abnormal. The news release is not clear on this point. Primary screening tests for cervical cancer include Pap smears and cervical swabs for human papilloma virus (HPV), or (when those are unavailable) visual inspection of the cervix after acetic acid is applied.
The release tends to exaggerate the potential benefit of this new technology by implying that colposcopy is essential as a primary screening test for all women — when it’s mainly used for the smaller number of women who initially screen positive. Indeed, there is evidence that colposcopy is not effective when used as a primary screening technique in all women.

Half of the patients received an appendectomy, which is the standard of care, while the other half got an IV of antibiotics for three days followed by antibiotic pills for a week.\n\nThe researchers found that 73% of the patients who took antibiotics recovered from appendicitis and did not need surgery for at least a year afterward. The rest of the patients -- who went on to have another case of appendicitis and need an appendectomy -- did not have a higher rate of complications than the patients who initially received surgery.\n\n""This is quite a radical change in the line of thinking, because appendectomy has served patients well for over 100 years,"" said Dr. Paulina Salminen, a surgeon at the Turku University Hospital in Finland and lead author of the study, which was published on Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association . An editorial accompanying the study added, ""the time has come to consider abandoning routine appendectomy for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis.""\n\nThe findings suggest that for patients with uncomplicated cases, who make up about 80% of the patients diagnosed with appendicitis, surgery may not be necessary, Salminen said. However, if the appendix has ruptured, emergency surgery must be done because patients can develop deadly infections in the abdomen and antibiotics alone are not strong enough to treat them, she added.\n\nRead More']","Story touts “surgery-free option for appendicitis”, but readers must dig deep to learn that far more study is needed.","The story gets generally good marks from us with a couple of provisos.  We liked the balanced discussion of the results and the physician comments in the story.  Unfortunately, the headline is overly enthusiastic in its description of the study results. There was an important omission: the story did not report that the study actually failed in its primary objective to demonstrate that antibiotic therapy was as good as appendectomy.

By the end of the six-month study, patients who had received the text messages had reduced their cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index.\n\n""I have to say, we were pretty surprised that it worked,"" says Clara Chow, lead author of the study and program director of community-based cardiac services at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia.\n\nAnd it worked to improve not just one risk factor for heart disease, but many. ""These are the things that medications usually do, not text messages,"" says Chow, who is also an associate professor at Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney.\n\nIn a randomized clinical trial, more than 700 patients with coronary heart disease were split into two groups: half received four text messages per week for six months plus usual care, while the other half received just usual care.\n\nThe texts that patients received were semi-personalized, based on background information about each person, such as smoking status and preferred name. For example, vegetarian participants wouldn\'t receive the text message about how grilling steak is healthier than deep-frying it.\n\nOther texts might include something like, ""Hi, Elizabeth. Have you gone for your walk today?"" or ""Have you taken your medications yet today? It\'s important to take them at the same time each day.""\n\nThere\'s a lot of hype over mobile health interventions these days, Chow says. ""Everyone thinks it has a lot of potential, but there\'s actually very little evidence.""\n\nWhile there are more than 100,000 health-related apps on the market, the evidence to date is lacking as to whether many of those apps are safe or effective, according to Zubin Eapen, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine.\n\n""We [as physicians] are always looking for evidence to make sure that we are recommending the right things for our patients, whether it\'s a drug, a device or a digital product, like an app,"" says Eapen, who is also medical director of the Duke Heart Failure Same-Day Access Clinic.\n\nEapen coauthored an editorial, which was published alongside Chow\'s study, with Eric Peterson, the Fred Cobb Distinguished Professor of Medicine in the division of cardiology at Duke and an associate editor of JAMA.\n\nNot only does this research provide evidence that a text-based program can improve heart disease risk factors, but it also shows that a bunch of bells and whistles aren\'t required for successful health outcomes. A simple, low-cost program of text messaging can do the trick.\n\n""I like to look for things that are able to be used in multiple corners of our world, from low-income settings to high-income settings,"" Chow says. ""Everybody owns a mobile phone these days. You don\'t have to have a smartphone to text.""\n\nThat means more access across more sectors of a population. While almost two-thirds of American adults own a smartphone, that number rises even higher when you\'re talking about plain old cell phones – a full nine out of 10 American adults own some kind of cell phone.\n\nGlobally, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death. ""If we are going to reach a global population, we need solutions that are both scalable and affordable,"" Eapen says. ""And mobile health – and text messaging, maybe, in particular – represents both a scalable and affordable approach.""\n\nMaking healthy changes in behavior can be tough, but for patients with heart disease, it can be vital.\n\nYet those daily decisions – whether to smoke that cigarette, eat that piece of cake or skip the gym – are often ""far removed from the rewards or consequences,"" Eapen says. It can be hard to view those everyday decisions in light of more distant consequences, like having another heart attack or not living as long a life as desired. Encouraging text messages may help to inform those everyday decisions and keep a bigger goal in mind.\n\nChow and Eapen say the study has its limitations. It can\'t tell us whether text messaging could eventually lead to fewer subsequent heart attacks among the patients receiving those messages or whether the positive health outcomes would continue past the six-month study window. Yet patients in Chow\'s study resoundingly said that the text messaging helped them make the necessary changes – more than 90 percent of the participants found the program useful.\n\n""People said things like, \'It wasn\'t actually what the messages said, it was that someone was there supporting me, thinking about me,\' "" Chow says.\n\nAnd although Chow and her colleagues told study participants that they did not need to reply to the text messages, many of them still did. ""Heaps of them replied to us,"" she says. ""They would say, \'Thanks for the message. I\'ve been on my walk, my blood pressure is better.\' ""']",Adding some numbers to the description of benefits would’ve filled in this otherwise complete picture of the study.,"The story focuses on a JAMA study that found coronary heart disease patients who received four health-related text messages per week for six months were more likely to take steps to reduce their risk of heart-related health problems — and saw corresponding improvements in cholesterol and blood pressure. The story does a nice job of describing the study and is careful to note the study’s limitations, but could have done more to explain the extent to which patients benefited from the intervention.

That might be way too many.,"['Each year, five million people have wisdom teeth removed, but it\'s up in the air whether all of those surgeries were necessary.\n\nWisdom teeth, also called the third molars, are four teeth that grow at the very back of each corner of the mouth. For most people, they start to grow in between ages 17 and 25. They\'re thought to crowd out other teeth or cause tooth decay, which is why many dentists and oral surgeons think it\'s better to just nip those problems in the bud and take them out as a preventative measure.\n\nBut there\'s a serious debate between dentists and oral surgeons: should they preemptively remove someone\'s wisdom teeth if the patient doesn\'t have any symptoms?\n\nSimply put, there\'s no right answer. It comes down to what you, as a patient, want. Here\'s what you need to know to figure that out.\n\nDentists and oral surgeons are fighting over wisdom teeth\n\nDentists and oral surgeons agree across the board that there\'s cause to remove wisdom teeth if a patient is in pain or if there are signs of disease popping up, like tooth decay or infection. That\'s an obvious choice. But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren\'t any symptoms is where the professionals get into it.\n\nMany dental professionals stick with a watch and wait approach with wisdom teeth to avoid surgery if possible. ""Many people don’t have adequate space in their jaw for the teeth to come into full position, but that alone isn’t justification of having them all removed,"" says Dr. Scott Tomar of University of North Carolina\'s School of Dentistry. Tomar says that as a dentist he feels the risks of complication, including infection and hitting nerves during surgery, outweigh any benefits of preventative removal.\n\nIn 2007, oral surgeon Dr. Jay Friedman called the preventative removals a public health hazard in the American Journal of Public Health. The American Public Health Association has sided with this argument since 2008, when it formally opposed the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. (The same thing happened with tonsils, which doctors no longer remove just to get rid of the chance of infection later on.)\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having their wisdom teeth removed\n\nSome doctors, though, still see preventative oral surgery as being two steps ahead of the problem. If you\'re going to need your wisdom teeth out eventually, why not have them removed when you\'re younger and are more likely to recover more easily? Some think of removing the wisdom teeth early on as a way to lessen the crowding of other teeth\n\n""You might not have symptoms now, but you can\'t assume it\'s gonna be that way for the rest of your life,"" says Dr. Ray White, an oral surgeon working at University of North Carolina. Rather than let the teeth cause problems later on, many oral surgeons remove them.\n\nBut a 2012 Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials found there\'s no evidence that removing wisdom teeth will prevent or reduce crowding of other teeth down the line. And a different Cochrane review found that watching and waiting can ""may reduce the number of surgical procedures by 60 percent or more.\n\nThe question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on\n\nIt\'s worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved.\n\n""Are there people gaming the system? Sure. You don\'t get paid much for not doing anything,"" White says. ""But I\'d hope we can get past that.""\n\nThe American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons says, ""There is no pat answer, cookbook recipe, or flow chart that is universally accepted regarding the decision making process"" in these cases. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients.\n\nThe risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth\n\nThere\'s a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life.\n\nThere\'s also a chance that they\'ll need to come out later. If that\'s the case, you can\'t always plan for it. Opting to have them removed gives patients time to plan around the procedure, which leaves people out of commission for about three days.\n\nBut inconvenience isn\'t the only risk. ""The risk for complications increases as people get older, and the duration of disability after the operation gets longer as people get older,"" says oral surgeon Dr. Thomas Dodson.\n\nIn some cases, the extraction can be more painful if you wait, Dodson says. That\'s because the tooth is easier to remove if its roots aren\'t fully developed.\n\nThe common risks related to the surgery include poor wound healing, infection, pain, and uncontrolled bleeding. Nerve injury, in rare cases of wisdom teeth removal, can leave people with permanent numbness around the face and mouth, according to the APHA.\n\nAmericans spend billions each year on wisdom teeth\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having 10 million wisdom teeth removed, according to the American Public Health Association. That\'s a hefty bill for something we may or may not need. How much it costs depends on how the molars are situated. A simple surgical extraction for a wisdom tooth that\'s showing through the gums should run about $230, according to Healthcare Bluebook. If it\'s impacted (pushed against another tooth and unable to fully come through the gum), the cost jumps to about $400 per tooth.\n\nUpdate: Added information about the number of teeth removed.']",Congratulations to Vox for a strong debut at HealthNewsReview.org. This was a 4-star effort that questions a very common and costly dental practice.,"This story explores a simmering debate among dentists and oral surgeons over the wisdom of preventative wisdom tooth removal. This issue primarily affects 17-25 year olds, since that is the age when the third molars typically appear and when they are least resistant to removal. The story thoroughly surveys the landscape, giving readers a nice synopsis of each camp’s argument and the evidence (or lack thereof) that supports it. Costs are closely examined. The story would have been stronger had it attached a few more numbers to the potential risks and benefits of each approach.

In select patients surgical intervention to remove the clot may be possible to mitigate effects of the stroke.\n\nCurrently, the American Stroke Association advises that blood clot removal for some patients -- an emergency procedure called endovascular thrombectomy recently developed and increasingly used in addition to medical therapies -- should be done within six hours after stroke symptoms to lower the amount of disability patients will face later. But this analysis showed that the time for treatment could be slightly longer -- up to 7.3 hours.\n\nThis study could affect the current guidelines on treating stroke patients, according to Dr. Cathy Sila, Director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. She said there is ""compelling rationale to move that window a little bit.""\n\nAs a result of having lost blood flow to the brain for an extended time, stroke victims often suffer physical disabilities and lose varying degrees of their independence. They often require longer-term care and therapies.\n\n""Long-term disability of stroke is more expensive than cost of hospitalization,"" Sila told ABC News today.\n\nAuthors from multiple institutions including the University of Calgary, pooled data from five studies on stroke treatments to see if providing endovascular thrombectomy in addition to standard medical treatment past six hours would help patients. They analyzed those studies for patients who have had large blood vessel strokes, seeking to understand how much of an effect blood clot removal surgery performed after six hours would have on their longer-term recovery. They used a benchmark of three months after the stroke to assess patients\' level of disability.\n\nIn total, 1,287 patients were enrolled in the five trials studied. The researchers examined clinical data and brain imaging in addition to the patients’ physical function. They found that the patients who received standard medical therapy along with an endovascular thrombectomy up to 7.3 hours after developing stroke symptoms were less likely than patients who were treated with only medications to report disability three months later.\n\nWhen they examined the patients three months after the stroke, each hour delay in receiving the treatment corresponded in worse outcomes for the patients, including more severe disability and less functional independence.\n\nThis meant that even the patients who received the treatment outside of the generally accepted 6 hours cut off up to the 7.3 hours point tended to report less disability during their recovery. However, if people received the treatment after 7.3 hours from onset of symptoms there was no statistical improvement.\n\nDr. Mayank Goyal, a co-author of the study and professor of Radiology, University of Calgary, said he hopes the study will help raise awareness about the importance of getting prompt treatment for a stroke and having an efficient system to provide this procedure.\n\n""Time is brain,"" Goyal told ABC News. ""The faster we can re-establish blood flow to brain, the higher the likelihood of the patients having a good outcome and going back to independent living.""\n\nSila said further study is needed to find out if these kinds of procedures could benefit people even after the 7.3 hours from symptom onset. She pointed out that these studies are important since they can help change guidelines and push insurance companies to cover the procedure for more patients.\n\n""We need to have this kind of data so third party payers would have it to base [costs] on,"" she said.\n\nDr. Lei Lynn is an internal medicine resident at George Washington University Hospital and a resident in the ABC News Medical Unit.']",The story also could have been more specific on the study findings.,"The news story focuses on a recent JAMA article that reports some stroke patients would benefit from surgically removing a blood clot — via a process called endovascular thrombectomy — up to 7.3 hours after stroke symptoms appear. This is a departure from existing guidelines, which say the surgery should only be done within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms.
The story does a good job of illustrating how the new research findings may affect the current standard of care for stroke patients–though it should have been clearer about which patients are eligible for this surgery. Also, the story only addresses costs indirectly, and does not address potential risks associated with endovascular thrombectomy nor adequately quantify the potential benefits of the surgical intervention.

(Nasdaq: CPXX) today announced positive results from the Phase 3 trial of VYXEOS™ (cytarabine: daunorubicin) Liposome for Injection (also known as CPX-351) in patients with high-risk (secondary) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to the standard of care regimen of cytarabine and daunorubicin known as 7+3. The trial met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. Data will be submitted for presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2016 Annual Meeting.\n\nThe median overall survival for patients treated with VYXEOS in the study was 9.56 months compared to 5.95 months for patients receiving 7+3, representing a 3.61 month improvement in favor of VYXEOS. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.69 (p=0.005) which represents a 31 percent reduction in the risk of death versus 7+3. The percentage of patients alive 12 months after randomization was 41.5% on the VYXEOS arm compared to 27.6% on the 7+3 arm. The percentage of patients alive 24 months after randomization was 31.1% on the VYXEOS arm compared to 12.3% on the 7+3 arm.\n\n""The overall survival advantage seen with CPX-351 compared to 7+3, along with a superior response rate and no increase in serious toxicity indicates that we\'ll likely have a new standard of care for treating older patients with secondary AML,"" said Jeffrey E. Lancet, M.D., senior member and chief of the Leukemia/Myelodysplasia Program at Moffitt Cancer Center and the principal investigator for the study. ""This represents a major step forward for a very difficult-to-treat patient population.""\n\nVYXEOS also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in induction response rate (CR+CRi of 47.7% versus 33.3%; p=0.016) and this significance was maintained for the analysis of CR alone (CR of 37.3% versus 25.6%, p=0.040).\n\nSixty-day all-cause mortality was 13.7% versus 21.2%, in favor of patients treated with VYXEOS.\n\nNo substantial difference in Grade 3 or higher adverse events was observed between VYXEOS and 7+3. In the intent-to-treat population, Grade 3 or higher, hematologic adverse events were similar for overall infections, febrile neutropenia, and bleeding events. In the intent-to-treat population, Grade 3 or higher, non-hematologic adverse events were similar across all organ systems, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, general systems, metabolic disorders, musculoskeletal, nervous system, respiratory, skin and renal.\n\n""These findings confirm that VYXEOS provides the first opportunity we\'ve had in decades to extend survival for patients with high-risk AML,"" added Gail Roboz, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Director of the Leukemia Program at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University and the New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York. ""Also, more patients in remission means more who are eligible for potentially curative therapy.""\n\nBased on these results the company expects to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for VYXEOS with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year and submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n""The successful outcome of this Phase 3 trial represents an important advance for AML patients, their families and clinicians,"" said Scott Jackson, Chief Executive Officer of Celator Pharmaceuticals. ""It also marks a major milestone for Celator, for VYXEOS, and for our CombiPlex® platform. We offer our sincere thanks to the patients and investigators who participated in this study and we will work closely with regulatory authorities to make this new treatment available to the AML community as soon as possible.""\n\nThe clinical trial was conducted in partnership with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society® (LLS) through its Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP), which has supported the clinical development of VYXEOS beginning in Phase 2.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nCelator will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 8:00am EDT to discuss the results of the Phase 3 trial. To participate in the conference call, please dial 877-303-6316 (domestic) or 650-521-5176 (international) and refer to conference ID 71930208. The live webcast of the call can be accessed in the Investors section of Celator\'s website at www.celatorpharma.com. An archived webcast will be available on Celator\'s website beginning approximately two hours after the event.\n\nAbout VYXEOS\n\nVYXEOS (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome for Injection, also known as CPX-351, is a nano-scale co-formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin at a synergistic 5:1 molar ration. VYXEOS represents a novel approach to developing combinations of drugs in which molar ratios of two drugs with synergistic anti-tumor activity are encapsulated in a nano-scale liposome in order to maintain the desired ratio following administration. VYXEOS was granted orphan drug status by the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). VYXEOS was also granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of elderly patients with secondary AML. In addition to the Phase 3 trial, Celator published results from two randomized, controlled, Phase 2 trials with VYXEOS. The first trial was conducted in newly diagnosed elderly AML patients and the second trial was conducted in patients with AML in first relapse.\n\nPhase 3 Trial Design\n\nThe randomized, controlled, Phase 3 trial (Protocol NCT01696084), enrolled 309 patients at 39 sites in the United States and Canada, and compared VYXEOS to the conventional cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment regimen (commonly referred to as 7+3) as first-line therapy in older (60-75 years of age) patients with high-risk (secondary) AML. Patients were stratified for age (60 to 69 and 70 to 75 years of age) and AML type; treatment-related AML, AML with documented history of MDS with prior treatment with hypomethylating agent therapy, AML with documented history of MDS without prior hypomethlyating agent therapy, AML with a documented history of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL), and de novo AML with a karyotype characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).\n\nPatients were randomized 1:1 to receive either VYXEOS or 7+3. Patients could receive one or two inductions, and responding patients could receive one or two consolidations. First induction for VYXEOS was 100u/m2; days 1, 3, and 5 by 90-minute infusion and for the control arm was cytarabine 100mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 7 days and daunorubicin 60mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3 (7+3). Second induction for VYXEOS-treated patients was 100u/m2 on days 1 and 3 and the control arm was cytarabine 100mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 5 days and daunorubicin 60mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 (5+2).\n\nOnly patients with documented CR or CRi were eligible to receive chemotherapy consolidation. Consolidation for VYXEOS-treated patients was 65u/m2 on days 1 and 3 and the control arm was cytarabine 100mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 5 days and daunorubicin 60mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 (5+2).\n\nAbout AML\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature blast cells in the bone marrow. AML is generally a disease of older adults, and the median age of a patient diagnosed with AML is about 67 years. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be 19,950 new cases of AML and 10,430 deaths from AML in the U.S. in 2016. In Europe the number of new cases is estimated to be 18,000 and in Japan the number is 5,500. The Company estimates that nearly 70 percent of AML patients are over the age of 60, and approximately 75 percent are intermediate or high risk. Furthermore, approximately half of those patients are considered suitable for intensive treatment.\n\nEven with current treatment, overall survival for AML is poor. In patients over 60 years of age, the 5 year survival rate is less than 10%. In high-risk (secondary) AML, overall survival is lower, resulting in an acute need for new treatment options for these patients.\n\nAbout Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nCelator Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with locations in Ewing, N.J., and Vancouver, B.C., is an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company that is transforming the science of combination therapy, and developing products to improve patient outcomes in cancer. Celator\'s proprietary technology platform, CombiPlex®, enables the rational design and rapid evaluation of optimized combinations of anti-cancer drugs, incorporating traditional chemotherapies as well as molecularly targeted agents to deliver enhanced anti-cancer activity. CombiPlex addresses several fundamental shortcomings of conventional combination regimens, as well as the challenges inherent in combination drug development, by identifying the most effective synergistic molar ratio of the drugs being combined in vitro, and fixing this ratio in a nano-scale drug delivery complex to maintain the optimized combination after administration and ensuring exposure of this ratio to the tumor. Celator\'s pipeline includes the lead product, VYXEOS™ (also known as CPX-351), a nano-scale liposomal formulation of cytarabine:daunorubicin being studied for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia; CPX-1, a nano-scale liposomal formulation of irinotecan:floxuridine studied in colorectal cancer; and a preclinical stage product candidate, CPX-8, a hydrophobic docetaxel prodrug nanoparticle formulation.

Hair may fall out entirely, gradually, in sections, or may become thin. Hair loss due to cancer treatment is usually temporary, but minimizing or relieving these kinds of side effects are considered important to overall treatment.\n\n“We are pleased to see a product for breast cancer patients that can minimize chemotherapy-induced hair loss and contribute to the quality of life of these individuals,” said William Maisel, M.D., M.P.H., acting director of the Office of Device Evaluation in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Managing the side effects of chemotherapy is a critical component to overall health and recovery.”\n\nThe Dignitana DigniCap Cooling System is indicated to reduce the frequency and severity of alopecia during chemotherapy in breast cancer patients in which alopecia-inducing chemotherapeutic agents and doses are used. It is a computer-controlled system that circulates cooled liquid to a head-worn cooling cap during chemotherapy treatment. The cooling cap is covered by a second cap made from neoprene, which holds the cooling cap in place and acts as an insulation cover to prevent loss of cooling.\n\nThe cooling action is intended to constrict blood vessels in the scalp, which, in theory, reduces the amount of chemotherapy that reaches cells in the hair follicles (hair roots). The cold also decreases the activity of the hair follicles, which slows down cell division and makes them less affected by chemotherapy. The combined actions are thought to reduce the effect chemotherapy has on the cells, which may reduce hair loss. DigniCap may not work with some chemotherapy regimens. Interested patients should talk with their doctors.\n\nThe efficacy of the cooling system was studied in 122 Stage I and Stage II women with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy, using recognized chemotherapy regimens that have been associated with hair loss. The data from this study may also be applied to some Stage III and IV breast cancer patients because they may have a benefit-risk profile comparable to the patients enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint was a self-assessment of hair loss by the women using standardized photographs at one month (three-six weeks) after the last chemotherapy cycle. More than 66 percent of patients treated with the DigniCap reported losing less than half their hair.\n\nPrevention of hair loss in these patients may be a significant benefit to their quality of life, and the risk of the chemotherapy drug missing an isolated grouping of the breast cancer cells in the scalp because of the cold cap is extremely rare.\n\nThe most common side effects of the cooling system include cold-induced headaches and neck and shoulder discomfort, chills, and pain associated with wearing the cooling cap for an extended period of time.\n\nThe FDA reviewed data for DigniCap cooling system through the de novo classification process, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and not substantially equivalent to any legally marketed device.\n\nThe DigniCap Cooling System is manufactured by Dignitana Inc., in Lund, Sweden.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###']",FDA describes the novel cooling cap it approved for the reduction of hair loss in breast cancer patients during chemotherapy.,"Credit: DigniCap
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued this news release following its approval of the first cooling cap for the U.S. market. While undergoing chemotherapy, breast cancer patients may pursue courses of treatment with the DigniCap scalp cooling device to prevent hair loss.
The release does a few things well. It uses appropriate wording to describe hair loss, addresses the harms of the cooling system and establishes high up in the story the novelty of the medical device. But the report lacks crucial details when quantifying benefits, evaluating the quality of evidence and discussing costs. We don’t know if there was a control group in the study, what its limitations are and how much a course of treatment is. Another problematic point that was overlooked was the conflict of interest present in the clinical trial: DigniCap’s manufacturers collaborated with a private organization to conduct the research and to submit the FDA application.

Higher soy intake was also associated with less reported fatigue. The breast cancer survivors studied included 173 non-Hispanic white and 192 Chinese Americans including US-born Chinese and Chinese immigrants.\n\nResearchers say breast cancer survivors often experience side effects from cancer treatments that can persist months or years after completion of treatment. For example, because many treatments designed to prevent breast cancer recurrence inhibit the body\'s production or use of estrogen, the hormone that can fuel breast cancer growth, breast cancer patients often experience hot flashes and night sweats, among other side effects.\n\nThe lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments.\n\n""These symptoms can adversely impact survivors\' quality of life and can lead them to stopping ongoing treatments, she says. ""Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors.""\n\nWhen study participants were evaluated separately by race/ethnicity, associations were significant among white breast cancer survivors; however; while a trend was seen in the benefit for Chinese women, results were not statically significant. Researchers explain Chinese women typically report fewer menopausal symptoms. Most of them also consume cruciferous vegetables and soy foods, making it difficult to see a significant effect in this subgroup. Indeed, in this study, Chinese breast cancer survivors ate more than twice as much soy and cruciferous vegetables.\n\nWhether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study\'s senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi\'s Cancer Prevention and Control Program.\n\nResults obtained in preclinical studies in animals show that biologically active compounds present in both soy and cruciferous vegetables cause breast cancer cells to grow, but have opposite effects in animals that consume these compounds well before cancer is diagnosed and continue consuming them during and after cancer treatments.\n\nUntil more research is conducted, breast cancer patients should not suddenly start eating soy, if they have not consumed it before, says Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi and a co-author of the study.\n\nResearchers also found suggestive associations with lower reporting of other symptoms, including joint problems, hair thinning/loss and memory less in women who consumed more soy foods, but these associations did not reach statistical significance.\n\nPhytochemicals, or bioactive food components, such as isoflavones in soy foods and glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables may be the source of the benefit, researchers say. Isoflavones bind to estrogen receptors and exert weak estrogenic effects, among other effects. Glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables influence levels of metabolizing enzymes that can modulate inflammation and levels of estrogen, possibly attenuating treatment-related symptoms.\n\n###\n\nCo-authors of the study include Chiranjeev Dash, MBBS, MPH, PhD, Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, and Yun-Ling Zhen, MPH, PhD, from Georgetown Lombardi; Yi-Tin Hwang, PhD, from National Taipei University, Taiwan; Scarlett Lin Gomez, MPH, PhD, from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California; Teresa T.

In short, how do these findings relate to their own experiences?","This news release rather thinly describes a study designed to demonstrate whether chemicals naturally found in soy-based foods and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and kale are linked to reduced side effects of hormone-related treatments among breast cancer survivors.
Although the release ably describes some of the reasons the dietary intervention might work and how, it offers no numbers or measurements to support the conclusion that these foods are associated with fewer menopausal symptoms such as fatigue and hot flashes. Nor does it describe how dietary data were collected, and thus how reliable they are. While it aptly cautions breast cancer patients not to start a soy-rich diet until further research is done, it doesn’t say why caution is recommend. Nor does it describe just how much of these foods might be considered beneficial or harmful in a normal diet.

No survival benefit was seen among men taking alprostadil, another type of erectile dysfunction drug that works through a different mechanism.\n\n""If you have an active sex life after a heart attack, it is probably safe to use PDE5 inhibitors,"" said Daniel Peter Andersson, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm and the study\'s lead author. ""This type of erectile dysfunction treatment is beneficial in terms of prognosis, and having an active sex life seems to be a marker for a decreased risk of death.""\n\nThe research is based on a Swedish national database of health records that includes all hospitals in Sweden. Researchers analyzed the records of men age 80 years or younger who were hospitalized for a first heart attack between 2007 and 2013. Tracking the men for an average of 3.3 years following this first heart attack, they compared outcomes among those who subsequently filled a prescription for a PDE5 inhibitor or alprostadil to those who did not. Overall just over 7 percent of men were prescribed an erectile dysfunction drug, 92 percent of whom were prescribed a PDE5 inhibitor and 8 percent of whom were prescribed alprostadil.\n\nAfter adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes, heart failure and stroke, those taking PDE5 inhibitors were found to be markedly less likely to die than those taking alprostadil or no erectile dysfunction drugs. Filling more prescriptions for PDE5 inhibitors appeared to be associated with a greater benefit, although Andersson said that trend should be interpreted with caution because the study was not large enough for a definitive dose-response analysis.\n\nIn addition to a decreased mortality, men using PDE5 inhibitors or alprostadil were 40 percent less likely to be hospitalized for heart failure compared to those not taking any erectile dysfunction drugs.\n\nAlthough the results provide evidence that PDE5 inhibitors may benefit heart health, the retrospective study design makes it impossible to ascertain direct cause and effect, Andersson noted. It is possible that using erectile dysfunction drugs simply indicates a more active sex life, which could itself contribute to, or be a marker of, a heart-healthy lifestyle overall.\n\n""We think that if you have an active sex life it\'s probably an indicator of a healthy lifestyle, especially in the oldest quartile--those 70 to 80 years old,"" Andersson said. ""From the perspective of a doctor, if a patient asks about erectile dysfunction drugs after a heart attack and has no contraindications for PDE5 inhibitors, based on these results you can feel safe about prescribing it.""\n\nAndersson said the results came as a surprise because erectile dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of heart disease in otherwise healthy men. However, previous studies have associated the use of PDE5 inhibitors with a decreased blood pressure in the left ventricle, which reduces the amount of work required to pump blood and therefore could help explain why the drugs might benefit people with heart failure. PDE5 inhibitors were initially developed to treat angina, a type of chest pain that results from constricted arteries.\n\nThe researchers also tracked the risk of a subsequent heart attack or cardiac revascularization procedure, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass but found the use of erectile dysfunction drugs had no effect on these outcomes.\n\nA limitation of the study is that the researchers did not assess the effects of untreated erectile dysfunction, or conversely, the effect of having an active sex life without taking erectile dysfunction drugs. The researchers also were unable to account for socioeconomic status; as a next step, they are planning a larger study that will include more health records and complete information on marital status, educational level and disposable income. They are also pursuing a separate analysis of outcomes from erectile dysfunction drugs in men with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.\n\n###\n\nThis study received funding from the Stockholm County Council and the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation.\n\nAndersson will present the study, ""Association Between Erectile Dysfunction and Death or Cardiovascular Outcomes After Myocardial Infarction,"" on Friday, March 17, at 1:30 p.m. ET at Poster Hall C at the American College of Cardiology\'s 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.

Because they’re observational.,"The release summarizes a Swedish study that found men who took erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs following a heart attack had a lower risk of dying or being hospitalized for heart failure than men who did not use these drugs.
The release does a good job providing information about this retrospective observational study. The study design, number of subjects and results are provided in a straightforward manner. The release also commented on the limits of observational research and didn’t make cause-and-effects claims such as that the drug “reduces risk.” 
The study obtained data on ED drug from national health records data and inclusion for the study was at least a single prescription for the drugs during the study period. How even a single prescription for an ED drug can in some way alter risks is unclear. There is a suggestion that the effect may be dose related but the study itself is silent on the issue. The release did note that the ability and desire to engage in sex may be a marker of reduced risks.

Because of that belief, most research today focuses on using vaccines to prevent the cells’ destruction in the first place, or on using beta cell transplants to replace the destroyed cells.\n\nThe new findings, however, hint that even in patients with long-standing diabetes, the body retains the potential to restore pancreas function if clinicians can only block the parts of the immune system that are killing the beta cells.\n\nThe results are “fascinating and very promising,” said immunology expert Dr. Eva Mezey, director of the adult stem-cell unit at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. But Mezey noted that the results had been achieved in only a small number of patients and that they suggest the vaccinations would have to be repeated regularly.\n\nThe key player in the diabetes study is a protein of the immune system called tumor necrosis factor, or TNF. Studies by others have shown that if you increase levels of TNF in the blood, it will block other parts of the immune system that attack the body, especially the pancreas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo raise TNF levels, Dr. Denise Faustman of Massachusetts General Hospital and her colleagues have been working with the BCG vaccine, known formally as Bacille Calmette-Guerin. BCG has been used for more than 80 years in relatively low doses to stimulate immunity against tuberculosis. More recently, it has been used in much higher doses to treat bladder cancer.\n\nFaustman first reported her findings in mice in a 2001 paper in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, but scientists reviewing her findings for that journal were so skeptical that she was not allowed to refer to “regeneration” of the pancreas in the paper. Instead, she was told to say “restoration of insulin secretion by return of blood sugar to normal.”\n\nIn 2003, she published a report in the journal Science in which she was able to use the word “regeneration,” but that finding was met by an “explosion of skepticism,” she said. Nonetheless, by 2007, “six international labs had duplicated the mouse experiments,” she said. “We needed to move forward into humans.”\n\nIn the human trial, Faustman and her colleagues studied six patients who had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes for an average of 15 years. They were randomly selected to receive either two doses of BCG spaced four weeks apart or a placebo.\n\nCareful examination of those receiving the vaccine showed a decline of T cells that normally attack the pancreas. It also revealed a temporary but statistically significant elevation of an insulin precursor called C-peptide, an indication that new insulin production was occurring.\n\n“If this is reproducible and correct, it could be a phenomenal finding,” said Dr. Robert R. Henry of UC San Diego, who chaired the scientific program at the meeting. It suggests that once the destructive immune response is controlled, the body has the capability to produce more insulin, he said.\n\nOne of the patients receiving a placebo also showed a similar elevation of C-peptide, but that patient coincidentally became infected by Epstein-Barr virus, which is known to induce production of TNF.\n\nThe concentrations of BCG that the team used were much lower than they would have liked, but were the highest the Food and Drug Administration would permit, Faustman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said she is now negotiating with the agency to use higher levels, which should produce a more pronounced effect, and to enroll more people.\n\nThe research is funded by philanthropists, primarily the Iacocca Family Foundation.\n\nthomas.maugh@latimes.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">It would be so easy to hype the extremely preliminary results of this research.  To its credit, this story did none of that. </span>","Responsible reporting of a promising, but very preliminary finding in diabetes research.

It found that bariatric surgery:\n\nslashed participants\' weight by a third\n\nproduced a mean weight loss of more than 100 pounds\n\neliminated precancerous uterine growths\n\nimproved physical quality of life\n\nimproved insulin levels and glucose use\n\naltered the composition of gut bacteria\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Oct. 1, 2015 - A study evaluating the effects of bariatric surgery on obese women most at risk for cancer has found that the weight-loss surgery slashed participants\' weight by a third and eliminated precancerous uterine growths in those that had them. Other effects included improving patients\' physical quality of life, improving their insulin levels and ability to use glucose - which may reduce their risk for diabetes - and even altering the composition of their gut bacteria.\n\nThe study speaks both to the benefits of bariatric surgery and to the tremendous toll obesity takes on health. ""If you look at cancers in women, about a fifth of all cancer deaths would be prevented if we had women at normal body weight in the U.S.,"" said Susan C. Modesitt, MD, of the University of Virginia Cancer Center. ""When you\'re looking at obesity-related cancers, the biggest one is endometrial cancer, but also colon cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer and gall bladder cancer. We think about 40 [percent] to 50 percent of all endometrial cancer, which is in the lining of the uterus, is caused by obesity.""\n\nEffects of Obesity and Morbid Obesity\n\nThe study looked at 71 women with a mean age of 44.2 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 50.9. Women are considered obese at a BMI of 30 and morbidly obese at 40 (which is typically about 100 pounds over a woman\'s ideal body weight), yet almost a third of women presenting for bariatric surgery did not identify themselves as obese.\n\nThe study looked at the effects of bariatric surgery in a relatively short timeframe, one to three years after surgery. A total of 68 participants underwent the procedure; two opted out of the surgery, and another died of a heart condition prior to surgery. The effects of surgery on body weight were dramatic: Mean weight loss was more than 100 pounds.\n\nPreventing Cancer\n\nTen percent of study participants who had not had a hysterectomy showed precancerous changes in the lining of the uterus, and all of those resolved with weight loss. ""We\'re talking about small numbers, really tiny numbers"" of study participants, Modesitt said, noting one limitation of the study. ""So I could never say that effect is definitive, but it is suggestive, given that we know already the incredibly strong link between endometrial cancer and obesity.""\n\nModesitt, of the UVA\'s Division of Gynecologic Oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, was most surprised by the dramatic changes seen in the patients\' metabolic profiles derived from the gut microbiome, the population of microorganisms living inside us. ""The study results demonstrate that there is a huge alteration, but I don\'t even know what to say about that, except it is really new and intriguing area to look at in the link between obesity and cancer. For example, before groundbreaking work by Dr. John Marshall at UVA in the past, no one knew that ulcers were from bacteria. Who knows what role the gut bacteria play in promoting obesity, but metabolic parameter/markers of the bacteria definitely changed after [study participants] lost weight.""\n\nWhile the study speaks to the transformative effect bariatric surgery can have, Modesitt urged people to avoid gaining weight in the first place and for those seeking to lose weight to exercise and eat more healthily before turning to surgery. ""We really should be working on diet and exercise from the get-go in our entire society, starting with our children. And exercise does seem to be protective -- even if you don\'t lose all the weight, it absolutely has beneficial effects,"" she said. ""There are lots of studies showing if you exercise, it improves your insulin, your glucose, all of those sorts of things that go along with the cancer-causing effect. Almost everybody agrees adding exercise would be wonderful and improve health on many levels.

Unfortunately, the story presents a misleading picture to readers by relying on one successful patient anecdote, and by making unqualified statements, such as “experts call the [procedure] the most major advance in stroke treatment in two decades.”
Scant attention is paid to the actual benefits quantified in the study that is the meat of the story. No attention is paid to the possible harms of the procedure. Costs are never mentioned, and there is no real discussion of the quality of the evidence. Instead the audience is left with a very powerful image of an otherwise healthy 43-year-old man suffering a stroke while driving, nearly killing himself in a subsequent car crash, being treated by surgery, and being fully restored to a normal life. His experience is certainly remarkable, but the audience is given the false impression that it is representative of everyone who has undergone the procedure or might in the future.

In recent years, doctors have started to focus on inflammation — the same process that makes cuts red and painful — as an important contributor to a heart attack. It’s the reason doctors recommend low-dose aspirin to prevent recurrent heart attacks in people who have already had them, why they also prescribe statins, which lower both cholesterol and inflammation, and why they have started to measure inflammation levels in the blood.\n\nBut it’s never been clear exactly how much inflammation adds to heart disease risk. Since statins lower both, it’s hard to tell whether inflammation or cholesterol has the bigger impact on heart problems.\n\nMORE: Why Inflammation in Your Mouth May Raise Your Risk of Cancer\n\nBut in a new paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting, scientists say they now have proof that lowering inflammation alone, without affecting cholesterol, also reduces the risk of a heart attack.\n\nIn the study, 10,000 people who have already had a heart attack were randomly assigned to get injected with a placebo or different doses of a drug called canakinumab. Canakinumab, made by Novartis, is currently approved to treat rare immune-related conditions and works to reduce inflammation but does not affect cholesterol levels. After four years, the people who received the drug had a 15% lower chance of having a heart attack or stroke compared to people who didn’t get the drug. The medication also reduced the need for angioplasty or bypass surgery by 30%.\n\n“Even I am pinching myself,” says Dr. Paul Ridker, who led the study and is director of the center for cardiovascular disease prevention at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and is a pioneer in exposing the role inflammation plays in heart disease. “This outcome is more than we hoped for. The bottom line is we now have clear evidence that lowering inflammation through this pathway lowers rates of heart attack and stroke with no change at all in cholesterol.”\n\nAbout a quarter of people who have heart attacks will have another heart event even if they keep their cholesterol at recommended levels. For them, it may not be cholesterol so much as inflammation that is driving their heart disease. So the study further solidifies the fact that heart doctors should be measure inflammation as well as cholesterol in their heart patients. An inexpensive blood test that looks for a protein that rises in the blood with inflammation, called C-reactive protein (CRP), can tell doctors how much inflammation their patients have. Beginning in 2003, the American Heart Association started to provide guidelines on how doctors should use CRP testing; for patients like those in the current trial, the group did not see any additional benefit to CRP testing since those patients should already be treated with statins, which can lower both cholesterol and inflammation.\n\nGet The Brief.

Ridker says the findings should clarify how doctors can optimize the way they treat their heart patients — about half of people who have had a heart attack tend to have high levels of inflammatory factors, while half have high cholesterol levels. The inexpensive CRP test could identify those with higher inflammation, who might be candidates for taking a drug like canakinumab.\n\nThe drug is not currently approved for any heart conditions, but Novartis will likely look at doing more studies to confirm its effectiveness in treating heart disease.\n\nPerhaps more intriguing are additional results that Ridker reported, related to cancer. In a separate study published in the Lancet using data from the same study, he found that people taking canakinumab lowered their risk of dying from any cancer over four years by 50%, and their risk of fatal lung cancer by 75%.\n\nWhile the connection between heart disease and cancer may not seem obvious, Ridker says that many people who have had heart problems, like those in the study, are former or current smokers, since smoking is a risk factor for heart attacks. And smoking increases inflammation. “People who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day are chronically inflaming their lungs,” he says. That’s why he decided to look at cancer deaths as well as heart events in his study population.\n\nThe cancer data is still preliminary, and needs to be confirmed with additional studies, but it’s encouraging, says Dr. Otis Bradley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study. “We know that free oxygen radicals and inflammation can damage DNA and can cause cancer,” he says. “This all makes sense to me.” Studies have already shown, for example, that inflammation may be a factor in prostate cancer and colon cancer.\n\nBut whether anti-inflammatory agents, like canakinumab, or even over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, should be part of standard cancer treatment isn’t clear yet. There are a number of different inflammatory pathways, and canakinumab targets just one. Other pathways, along with new anti-inflammatory drugs, may emerge with more research.\n\nWhen it comes to heart disease, however, it’s clear that inflammation-fighting medications like canakinumb may represent the next generation of treatment. “Ten years from now we will be doing more personalized medicine,” says Ridker. “Some people will get more cholesterol lowering. Some will get more inflammation-lowering drugs. Some will get other agents that we haven’t considered yet. It’s a wonderful new era in heart disease treatment.”\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]","The TIME story is without enough context when it reports that scientists now have “proof” that lowering inflammation alone, without affecting cholesterol, also reduces “the risk of a heart attack.”","People with heart disease and cancer, along with physicians, are bombarded almost daily with the onslaught of novel, eye-poppingly expensive, and ever “promising” new ways to treat or prevent these life-threatening disorders. Because their benefits and potential harms are so often barely known, and because their impacts are frequently confined to “subsets” of patients in clinical trials, the overall result is a see-saw of hope and despair that journalists find challenging to report and put into context.
The anti-inflammatory effects of a Novartis drug called canakinumab is the latest case in point. TIME magazine’s description of clinical trial results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, unfortunately fails to address the modest benefits, and the substantial risks and costs, of the drug. This is in contrast to a Reuters story on the same study that takes a far more cautious, cautionary and calibrated tone that better serves readers.

On two separate occasions, 12 of the people took a dose of MDMA and then spoke for several hours with a pair of trained therapists. The others took a placebo but received the same therapy. (All of the participants received additional therapy sessions that did not involve the drug.)\n\nTwo months later, 10 of the 12 people who took MDMA had improved to the point where they no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and three participants whose condition had prevented them from holding down a job were able to return to work.\n\nBy contrast, just two of the eight people in the placebo group experienced a substantial improvement in their symptoms.\n\nMDMA is believed to raise levels of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin and the so-called ""bonding hormone,"" oxytocin. The resulting sense of euphoria and emotional warmth seems to help patients connect with their therapists, says Michael Mithoefer, M.D., the lead author of the study and a Mount Pleasant, South Carolina-based psychiatrist who specializes in PTSD.\n\n""A lot of the time, people have quite painful and challenging experiences revisiting the trauma, and [MDMA] can help them do it without being overwhelmed or numbed out,"" he says.\n\nDon\'t try this experiment at home. Ecstasy use can cause depression, severe anxiety, and potential cognitive problems, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. And when purchased on the street it can be contaminated.\n\nConducting a study with an illegal drug is a complex process. This was the first clinical trial to explore the therapeutic potential of MDMA since the drug was outlawed in 1985, and the researchers required the permission of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration , and the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\n""It took quite a bit of time to get approval,"" Mithoefer says.\n\nThe study was funded by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a California-based nonprofit organization that also sponsors research on medical marijuana and psychedelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin.\n\nThe use of MDMA in psychotherapy has been studied for decades, but research in the U.S. all but ground to a halt after the drug became illegal.\n\nMithoefer and his team are now gearing up for a similar study involving combat veterans, which is scheduled to begin later this year.']","This is a Health.com story that appeared on the CNN Health website.  So CNN didn’t write it, but we hold CNN responsible for republishing it. And there’s a lot to take responsibility for herein. ","A very small study of the therapeutic potential of the illegal narcotic Ecstasy has produced what, on the surface, appears to be counterintuitive findings. The study indicates that taking Ecstasy may help people recover from post-traumatic stress disorder. The actual data to back these findings are shaky, at best, and readers should have been told more about the funders of this study. The story, though, is framed as if the case already has been proven and that if people can just find some Ecstasy that is pure enough, they will be able to cure their PTSD. While some counter-balancing facts are tossed in, the overall tone of the piece reads like a press release for the group that funded the study. The story seems like an attempt to generate some quick web hits by riding the Ecstasy titillation factor – and little more.

The study was selected for the society\'s ""Best of ASCO,"" an effort to condense the research ""most relevant and significant to oncology"" into a two-day program to increase global access to cutting-edge science.\n\n""Our findings will change the standard of care for women newly diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer,"" said principal investigator Atilla Soran, M.D., M.P.H., clinical professor of surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and breast surgical oncologist with UPMC CancerCenter. ""We\'ve shown that surgery to remove the primary tumor--either through lumpectomy or mastectomy--followed by standard therapy, is beneficial over no surgery.""\n\nDr. Soran began the trial in 2007, ultimately recruiting a total of 274 women newly diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer from 25 institutions. Half the women received standard therapy, which avoids surgery and consists of a combination of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy, while the other half first had surgery to remove their primary breast tumor, followed by the standard therapy.\n\nAt about 40 months after diagnosis, the women who received the surgery plus standard therapy lived an average of nine months longer than their counterparts who received standard therapy alone. Nearly 42 percent of the women who received surgery lived to five years after diagnosis, compared with less than 25 percent of the women who did not receive surgery.\n\nThe trial also showed that surgery in younger women with less aggressive cancers resulted in longer average survival than in women with more aggressive cancers that had spread to the liver or lungs.\n\n""Our thinking is similar to how you might approach a battle against two enemies,"" said Dr. Soran. ""First you quickly dispatch one army--the primary tumor--leaving you to concentrate all your efforts on battling the second army--any remaining cancer.""\n\n###\n\nThis research was primarily funded by the Turkish Federation of Societies for Breast Diseases.

The release doesn’t  acknowledge that the study found no difference between groups for the primary outcome (survival at 36 months).

Attacks can last anything from four to 72 hours.\n\nEach year more than 8.5 million people in the UK are thought to experience migraine – more than the number affected by asthma, diabetes and epilepsy combined.\n\nThe condition is linked to depression and sick days caused by migraine are estimated to cost the UK economy more than £2bn per year.\n\nThe trial, called Strive, compared patients taking erenumab for six months with others given a non-active placebo dummy drug.\n\n\n\nThe research revealed that by months four to six, at least a 50% reduction in mean migraine days per month was achieved for just over 43% of patients injected under the skin with 70-mg of erenumab each month, while half of patients injected with the higher dose of 140-mg had such results. However, those given a placebo also saw benefits, with 26.6% of participants in this group experiencing such a reduction.\n\n\n\nLead investigator Prof Peter Goadsby, from King’s College hospital, London, said: “Strive … represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment.”\n\nThe findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that blocking the CGRP pathway could reduce the impact of migraine, he said. “The results of Strive represent a real transition for migraine patients from poorly understood, re-purposed treatments, to a specific migraine-designed therapy.”\n\nSimon Evans, chief executive of the charity Migraine Action, said: “Migraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when, in reality, it can be a debilitating, chronic condition that can destroy lives. The effects can last for hours, even days in many cases.\n\n“An option that can prevent migraine and that is well tolerated is therefore sorely needed, and we hope that this marks the start of real change in how this condition is treated and perceived.”\n\n\n\n“Broadly speaking I think this is a very interesting study and I think it is a good step forward for the field and I think it is a good day for migraine sufferers,” said professor Zameel Cader, Director of the Oxford Headache Centre who was not involved in the research, pointing out that the results were on a par with currently available therapies for migraine.\n\n“Placebo responses [in migraine studies] are quite high and I think that is partly due to the subjective nature of pain and because of the strong psychological effects that being treated have on that experience of pain and those symptoms,” he said, adding that injections generally result in an even stronger placebo effect than tablets.\n\n\n\nCader said that he too was looking at running trials using antibodies, and said he was excited about the approach since it might result in fewer side effects than current therapies, and would mean individuals would not have to remember to take a table every day.\n\n“This is probably the first example of a migraine preventing drug that was rationally designed, rather than serendipitously found,” he added.\n\nAmgen and Novartis, the codevelopers of erenumab, funded the trial, while Amgen also supplied the drug and conducted the data analyses.']","But, the piece does a good job putting the results into context and even compares those findings to the placebo group, giving them a more transparent and helpful context.","The Guardian covers a new phase III clinical trial of erenumab, a drug injected monthly, designed to reduce the frequency of painful migraines.

Many news organizations used more sensational “breakthrough” language than The Guardian did in this story.  But this was still only half a loaf, inexplicably reporting on one migraine study in the New England Journal of Medicine without even mentioning or linking to another migraine study in the same journal with a somewhat similar antibody agent.  Why?

Roughly 70% of these procedures are performed on patients suffering symptoms of a heart attack and aren\'t medically controversial. But the remainder are done on stable patients who are suffering mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Of those, 50% are deemed appropriate, 38% uncertain and 12% inappropriate, the report says.\n\n""One in eight is probably higher than we would like,"" said Paul Chan, a cardiologist at Saint Luke\'s Mid America Heart and Vascular Institute, Kansas City, Mo., and the study\'s lead author.\n\nThe results, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Tuesday, come amid rising concern about the overuse of big ticket medical technology. Such concerns are rising not only in cardiology, but in other major specialties as state and federal governments and health insurers seek to contain health-care costs.\n\n""This tends to confirm concerns that many people have expressed—that there are many thousands of patients who undergo coronary interventions for very questionable indications,"" said Steven Nissen, head of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nResearchers cautioned that the findings are complicated and include some results that are reassuring and others that are troubling. The study is part of an unusual initiative by the American College of Cardiology to examine the extent of unnecessary procedures in part because of growing concerns in recent years that angioplasty and especially stents are overused.\n\nIt comes just days after a separate initiative in the field of spine surgery. Last week, The Spine Journal, the official publication of the North American Spine Society, published a study revealing that surgeons who collectively received tens of millions of dollars from medical-device giant Medtronic Inc. failed to report serious complications in a dozen research papers they wrote about a Medtronic bone-growth protein.\n\nAs health-care costs continue to soar, reaching $2.5 trillion in the U.S. in 2009, medical societies are becoming more open to self-scrutiny for fear that the federal government and private health insurers will make medical decisions for them. Some organizations are also mindful that conflicts of interest undermine the credibility of their fields.\n\nOne big warning sign that stents were likely being implanted unnecessarily in some patients came in 2007 when the New England Journal of Medicine published a study known as ""Courage"" by a Buffalo, N.Y. cardiologist named William Boden. The Courage study, which tracked 2,287 patients for five years, showed stents weren\'t any better than a cocktail of medicines to treat patients suffering from chronic but stable chest pain.\n\nLast December, the Senate Finance Committee released a report on a Maryland cardiologist, Mark Midei, who allegedly performed unnecessary angioplasties on hundreds of patients. Dr. Midei was suspended by his hospital, St. Joseph Medical Center in Towson, Md., and charged with unprofessional conduct by the Maryland State Board of Physicians.\n\nThe Senate report revealed that Abbott Laboratories, ABT -0.14% one of the biggest makers of stents, hired Dr. Midei as a sales consultant after St. Joseph\'s barred him from operating on patients. Abbott also feted Dr. Midei in 2008 with a $1,407 pig roast when he implanted 30 stents in a single day, setting what may have been a company record.\n\nAfter Dr. Midei\'s departure, the number of patients who received stents at St. Joseph\'s fell to 116 in 2009 from 350 the year before. Dr. Midei has denied the allegations and sued St. Joseph for damaging his career. His lawyer couldn\'t immediately be reached for comment. Abbott has said its affiliation with him ended in early 2010, and has declined to comment on the specifics of the relationship. The company declined to comment about Tuesday\'s JAMA study. A spokeswoman for St. Joseph\'s said Dr. Midei\'s privileges remain suspended and he hasn\'t performed any cardiac catheterizations on patients there since May 12, 2009.\n\nMedicare paid some $25.7 billion for stent procedures in the six years through 2009, according to the Senate report. However, use of the devices has leveled off amid the controversy, leading one of the field\'s biggest players, Johnson & Johnson, JNJ -1.03% to announce last month that it would stop making stents.\n\nThe new study is from data submitted by 1,091 hospitals—about 80% of those which perform angioplasty and stent procedures in the U.S.—to the National Cardiovascular Data Registry, which is maintained by the cardiology college.\n\nThe study looked at data from 500,154 procedures, which doctors call percutaneous coronary interventions, or PCI, and compared them against appropriateness criteria recently adopted by a team of 17 heart experts.\n\nUse of angioplasty and stents in patients suffering a heart attack is proven to save lives and there is little disagreement about their use in that setting. The study found that nearly 99% of procedures in such patients, including some who were suffering ""high risk"" unstable chest pain, were appropriate.\n\nBut in more-stable patients, the procedure hasn\'t been shown to save lives or prevent heart attacks. In this group, the study found just 50% were appropriate\n\nSt. Luke\'s Dr. Chan noted there was ""huge variation"" across hospitals, with one-quarter of them having an inappropriate case rate of 6% or under and another 25% doing 16% or more inappropriate cases.\n\n""We suspect that part of the [problem] may be driven by a huge push for screening patients who don\'t have symptoms but have risk factors for disease,"" he said. In a screening, some test may show an abnormality which leads to a cardiac catheterization to look at a patient\'s arteries, he said.

In another study, people were randomly assigned to use second skin or a placebo under their eyes. Trained observers graded the subjects on the appearance of the undereye skin. The product’s durability was tested in volunteers who wore it while running in heat and working up a sweat, while swimming, and while going out in a rainstorm.\n\nOne of the important uses, the researchers said, is in treating eczema and the sort of dry skin that comes with aging, with dry itchy patches on the back and legs that keep people up at night, scratching.\n\n“We tell people to pat their skin with a damp washcloth and put on a heavy moisturizer, but that only lasts a short time,” Dr. Gilchrest said. “They end up with greasy goo all over the sheets, and they wake up in the middle of the night, terribly uncomfortable. We need something that was easier to use and didn’t make a mess and stays. Which is what this stuff does.”\n\nAnother application of the second skin is to keep drugs like cortisone creams on the skin, Dr. Anderson said.

And a new clinical trial suggests they are not just blowing smoke.\n\nThe study, published Monday, found that for 30 MS patients with muscle “spasticity,” a few days of marijuana smoking brought some relief.\n\nBut the big caveat, researchers say, is that it’s not clear that the downsides of pot smoking are worth it.\n\nSome people with MS are already using medical marijuana to treat certain symptoms, including spasticity — when the muscles in the legs or arms contract painfully, in something akin to a “charley horse.”\n\nThere is some science behind the idea: The body naturally produces cannabinoids, the group of chemicals found in marijuana. And studies have suggested the cannabinoid receptors on our cells help regulate muscle spasticity.\n\nBut the evidence that pot smoking actually helps with spasticity has been anecdotal.\n\n“We’ve heard from patients that marijuana helps their spasticity, but I think a lot us thought, ‘Well, it’s probably just making you feel good,’” said Dr. Jody Corey-Bloom, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n“I think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,” said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego.\n\nThe cost, her team found, is that smoking caused fatigue and dizziness in some users, and generally slowed down people’s mental skills soon after they used marijuana.\n\nBut it’s not clear if that would have any long-term consequences, Corey-Bloom said.\n\nAbout 400,000 people in the United States have MS, a chronic disease in which the protective coating around nerve fibers starts breaking down.\n\nThe new study, reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, included 30 MS patients with muscle spasticity that had failed to get better with standard medication.\n\nCorey-Bloom’s team had each patient smoke marijuana or “placebo” joints — which looked, smelled and tasted like the real thing, but lacked the active ingredient in marijuana, known as THC.\n\nEach patient smoked marijuana once a day for three days and used the placebo cigarette once a day on three separate days. Before and after each treatment, an independent rater assessed the patients’ muscle spasticity.\n\nOverall, the study found, measures of spasticity dropped an average of three points —about 30 percent — on a 24-point scale when patients smoked marijuana, but didn’t change after they smoked the placebo.\n\nThe issue of treating spasticity is “certainly an important one,” said Nicholas LaRocca, vice president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society.\n\n“Spasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don’t necessarily work for everyone,” said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n“But smoking marijuana does not appear to be a long-term solution, because of the cognitive effects,” he told Reuters Health.\n\nPeople with MS are already at some risk of “cognitive changes,” LaRocca pointed out, so the potential for lasting effects from long-term marijuana smoking is a concern.\n\nHowever, LaRocca said, researchers are developing cannabinoid-based medications for MS. That includes a cannabinoid mouth spray called Sativex that has been approved in the UK, Canada, Spain and New Zealand to treat MS-related spasticity.\n\nResearch into cannabinoids and spasticity should continue, LaRocca said, because medications may be able to harness the benefits of specific cannabis compounds, without the side effects linked to smoking pot.\n\nBoth LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study.\n\n“Blinding” people as to whether they are on marijuana or a placebo is tough since the drug creates a “high” feeling.\n\nIn this study, 17 of 30 patients were able to correctly guess whether they were using marijuana or a placebo at each of their six visits with the researchers. And the rest often guessed correctly.\n\n“It’s pretty clear that the patients were not really blinded,” LaRocca said. “What effects that might have had on the results is unclear.”\n\nCorey-Bloom said that should not have influenced the spasticity findings, since an independent researcher (who didn’t know whether patients were smoking marijuana or the placebo) rated spasticity using a standard scale.\n\nBut another limitation, she pointed out, is that the study looked at the effects, and side effects, of marijuana over only a few days. “We can’t say anything about long-term effects,” Corey-Bloom told Reuters Health.\n\nFor now, LaRocca recommended that people with spasticity see a doctor experienced in treating MS. And if you’re on an anti-spasticity medication and it’s not working well enough, or the side effects are too much, tell your doctor, he said.\n\nFor some people, a change in the medication dose might help.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/qB3Mku Canadian Medical Association Journal, online May 14, 2012.']","On a subject that is easily sensationalized, this story was measured and analytical in its reporting of a very preliminary study.","For every claim there was a caution.

Still, thanks to science, genetics need not always be destiny, as Martha Teichner shows us in our Cover Story:\n\nAmy and Brad Price’s home in Omaha, Nebraska, is crazy with all the kids around. There are seven of them, ages 2 to 11. But if you look closely, you’ll see small memorials to one more: Liviana, who died in 2013 at the age of 5½ of a rare, nightmare disease called late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy. MLD destroys brain cells and is caused by a single, faulty gene.\n\n“She was happy all the time,” Brad said.\n\nAmy added, “She loved pretty dresses.”\n\n“She loved her tutu,” Brad said.\n\nShe was talkative, addicted to “Caillou,” the animated TV series, a lively little girl, ‘til she was two. “Her knees were going a little knock-kneed,” Amy said. “And she had been just randomly falling down.”\n\nHer doctor said, “Nothing to worry about,” but she quickly got worse.\n\n“I was in the kitchen doing something and I heard her crying,” Amy recalled. “And I turned around and said, ‘Liviana, what’s wrong?’ And she said, ‘Mommy, my legs don’t work.’”\n\nLiviana was diagnosed in the fall of 2010. Amy recalled: “She’s sitting on the bed in her tutu and her colorful sweater, and they’re telling me she’s gonna die.”\n\nMany children with the disorder are dead by the age of 6. And it runs in families. If it hadn’t been for Liviana, Amy and Brad Price would never have known to have their other children tested. They learned that their infant son, Giovanni, had inherited the faulty gene, too.\n\n“I get a call from the doctor’s office,” said Amy, “I knew. And I was thinking, ‘I’ve just been told two of my kids now are gonna die.’”\n\nExcept that’s not what happened.\n\nDoing research online, Amy Price discovered the existence of a medical trial in Milan, Italy, of an extraordinary gene therapy treatment for MLD that would save Giovanni’s life -- and later, when his sister, Cecilia, was born with MLD, hers, too. The treatment works only on children who, like them, have not yet started showing symptoms.\n\nThe Price family scraped together the money to go to Milan.\n\n“The patients go to the surgery room for collection of the stem cells on Monday, and receive their cells back on Friday evening,” said Dr. Alessandra Biffi, who oversaw the trial.\n\nA patient’s stem cells contain the faulty gene, which the doctors have learned how to fix. Amazing, right? But then they need a vehicle to insert the good gene into the stem cells before those are put back into the patient’s body.\n\nHere’s what’s really amazing: That vehicle is the HIV virus, re-engineered so the children can’t get AIDS.\n\nWhy the HIV virus? “Is it particularly efficient at getting around the body?” Teichner asked.\n\n“Yeah, it’s very efficient in entering our cells, and that’s why we use it,” Dr. Biffi replied.\n\nHow well did the children do? It will take years to know for sure, but so far so good. “At least 70-80% of them have an outstanding benefit coming from the treatment,” Dr. Biffi said. “Some of the children were going to school and having a normal life.”\n\nGiovanni Price is six now, in first grade. He and his sister Cecilia (Ceci for short) have to go back to Milan twice a year to be tested and monitored.\n\nBrad Price calls Dr. Biffi “Our angel. She took us in like family.”\n\nSo why Italy, and not the United States?\n\nGene therapy has a checkered history. In the 1990s, hyped as the Next Big Thing, research withered here after serious setbacks, including a death during clinical trials. But more than 15 years later, it’s back. One sign: Dr. Biffi is now head of the gene therapy program at Dana-Farber/Boston Children’s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.\n\nTeichner asked, “Do you believe that gene therapy is finally coming into its own?”\n\n“I think yes, absolutely,” Dr. Biffi replied.\n\nThe MLD trial, she thinks, demonstrates what’s possible -- offering promise to the 30 million Americans who suffer from some 7,000 rare diseases.\n\nTrials for the experimental treatment Ceci and Giovanni Price received in Milan have not begun in the U.S. They are two of only 24 children in the world with MLD to receive it.\n\nCompare Giovanni to Calliope Joy Carr, also six, from Bala Cynwyd, Pa., outside Philadelphia. She can turn her head, a little. She can still smile and laugh. But that’s about all. She was diagnosed at 2.\n\nFor her parents, college professors Patrick Carr and Maria Kefalis, coming to terms with the disease was wrenching. “It’s decline in slow motion, and that’s difficult,” said Carr.\n\n“I remember the social worker said, ‘It’s good to try to cry in the shower to save it from your family and your children,’” Kefalis said.\n\nAfter more than a year of rage and grief, Kefalis decided that she had to find some way of helping MLD children. It was too late for Cal, but she was desperate to give her daughter’s life meaning.\n\n“We’re not wealthy people,” she said. “We didn’t know very influential people who could write a big check for a million dollars. And so we said, ‘Well, we’ll start selling cupcakes.’”\n\nThe Calliope Joy Foundation was formed in 2013. It’s been slow going, but the money added up. And when Kefalis learned about the Italian trial, and the fact that Amy Price had to keep going back to Milan with Giovanni and Ceci, it was clear she would use the money to help families get to Italy.\n\n“She sent me a picture of Giovanni playing in his front yard,” Kefalis said. “He’s three months younger than Cal, so he should’ve been as sick as Cal. He should have been on a feeding tube. He should be paralyzed. And I thought, I gotta be a part of this. I need to help this happen again and again and again.”\n\nMaria Kefalis has turned cupcakes into weapons of war -- her war against MLD. She’s raised more than $250,000, and helped where she could, but she’s hit a wall. So far, not a single gene replacement therapy has been approved by the FDA. The trial in Italy is closed to new patients. It could be years before any children with MLD will be allowed to receive the treatment in the United States.\n\n“Now, it’s just impatience,” Kefalis said. “Now it’s, like, ‘When do we get this here? What will it take. Tell me what you need me to do.’”\n\nUntil then, she continues to fight her battles one cupcake at a time -- the Price children, Giovanni and Cecilia, proof to her the war can be won.\n\nTeichner asked Brad and Amy Price, “You keep using the word ‘miracle.’ In what way is all of this a miracle?”\n\n“Our son’s still with us, and Cecilia as well,” they replied. “That’s the miracle.”\n\n\n\nFor more info:']","The story leans on one family’s experience to suggest that the experimental therapy is effective, when in fact the small trial has yet to be fully analyzed, published and peer reviewed.","This is an originally reported, people-driven story about children with a rare and deadly genetic disease known as metachromatic leukodystrophy undergoing an experimental gene therapy as part of a clinical trial in Italy.

950,story_reviews_01007,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/4302/,2011-09-06 04:00:00,"Rare surgery brings more weight loss, more risks","['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A less common form of obesity surgery may spur more weight loss than its far more popular cousin, gastric bypass — but at the price of greater long-term risks, researchers reported Tuesday.\n\nThe study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, followed 60 severely obese patients who were randomly assigned to either gastric bypass surgery or a more extensive procedure known as duodenal switch.\n\nTwo years after surgery, duodenal switch patients had lost more weight: about 50 pounds more, on average.\n\nPeople shed a substantial amount of weight with either type of surgery. Gastric bypass patients cut an average of 111 pounds, while duodenal switch patients dropped about 162.\n\nBut those extra pounds came with nearly double the complication rate.\n\nOf the 29 duodenal switch patients, 62 percent had problems like abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and intestinal obstruction. And several suffered long-term malnutrition — something not seen in the gastric bypass group.\n\nDuodenal switch is not a popular procedure. In a 2008 study, it accounted for just 1 percent of weight-loss, or bariatric, surgeries done in the U.S., and 5 percent in Europe.\n\nThe technique is often reserved for “superobese” patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 50 or higher — though some surgeons perform it with less severely obese patients too, explained Dr. Torgeir T. Sovik of Oslo University in Norway, the lead researcher on the new study.\n\n“As duodenal switch can be associated with more adverse events, this procedure should only be performed in carefully selected patients by a dedicated bariatric team,” Sovik told Reuters Health in an email. “And a closer follow-up after surgery is required after such procedures.”\n\nBut an expert not involved in the study went further.\n\n“This is an operation that should probably go away,” said Dr. Edward H. Livingston, a professor and surgeon at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\nThe average weight loss seen with either gastric bypass or duodenal switch will improve or reverse obesity-related ills like diabetes, sleep apnea and knee arthritis, according to Livingston, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nSo for those medical conditions, it probably wouldn’t matter if a person lost 100 pounds or 150 pounds over two years.\n\nBMI is a measure of weight relative to height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight, and above 30 is obese.\n\nThe patients in the current study were a fairly healthy group despite having a BMI of 50 or more.\n\nAfter two years, those who’d had a duodenal switch showed a greater improvement in their cholesterol levels. But those levels were near-normal (in both groups) to begin with, Livingston noted.\n\nThat begs the question, he said, of whether the extra weight loss “actually accomplished anything.”\n\n“The answer is ‘no,’” Livingston said.\n\nIn the U.S., where about 220,000 people underwent weight-loss surgery in 2009, gastric bypass is the most common form chosen.\n\nDuring gastric bypass, the upper portion of the stomach is stapled off to create a smaller pouch that restricts the amount of food a person can eat at one time. The surgeon also creates a bypass around the rest of the stomach and a portion of the small intestine, which limits the body’s absorption of food.\n\nDuodenal switch is more extensive. The surgeon removes part of the stomach, and the remaining “sleeve”-like stomach is attached to the final section of the small intestine; that puts even greater limits on the body’s absorption of calories and nutrients.\n\nBoth surgeries carry the long-term risk of nutritional deficiencies, and people need to take supplements and carefully monitor their diets for a lifetime afterward.\n\nBut the risks of nutrient deficiencies are greater with duodenal switch, and include some not seen with gastric bypass, Livingston pointed out.\n\nSome people, for instance, may have severe calcium and vitamin D loss leading to weak and fragile bones. Other problems include severe protein deficiency and night blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency (which is also reversible with extra vitamin A treatment).\n\nIn this study, three of the 29 duodenal switch patients developed protein malnutrition, two developed night blindness, and one had a severe iron deficiency that needed to be treated with iron infusions.\n\nLivingston said his advice to people considering weight-loss surgery is to avoid duodenal switch. “It’s just not a good operation,” he asserted.\n\nBut he also questioned the value of weight-loss surgery, in general, for severely obese people who do not have medical conditions that stand to improve or resolve after surgery.\n\nIn general, experts say that surgery could be an option for anyone with a BMI of 40 or higher; that translates, roughly, to a man who is at least 100 pounds overweight or a woman who is 80 pounds overweight.\n\nLivingston said he thinks more caution is in order when a very obese person is otherwise healthy.\n\nAlong with the risks of surgery, he said, there is still uncertainty about whether it actually lengthens people’s lives. Some studies have suggested it might, but not all.\n\nIn a study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Livingston and his colleagues found no survival advantage among severely obese patients who’d undergone weight-loss surgery versus those who hadn’t.\n\nThe study involved 850 U.S. veterans who underwent some form of weight-loss surgery, at an average age of about 50, and more than 41,000 vets who had only non-surgical care. There was no evidence that surgery improved longevity over the next seven years.\n\n“We really don’t even know if there’s a survival benefit,” Livingston said.\n\nThat, he added, makes the risks of duodenal switch seem even less worthwhile.\n\nBut according to Sovik, duodenal switch might be appropriate for some superobese patients.\n\nIn the U.S., he said, about one in three weight-loss surgery candidates have a BMI of 50 or higher. And studies suggest that a sizable percentage of those people will still have a BMI higher than 40 after gastric bypass.\n\nIn this study, one-quarter of gastric bypass patients still had a BMI that high two years after surgery — versus none of the duodenal switch patients.\n\nMore extensive monitoring after duodenal switch, Sovik noted, can help detect and manage side effects.\n\nHe pointed out, though, that larger, longer-term studies are still needed to show whether the extra weight loss with duodenal switch ultimately improves severely obese patients’ health and extends their lives.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/mQAUrf Annals of Internal Medicine, online September 6, 2011.']",This story portrays the controversy in treating chronic obesity by clearly explaining the delicate balance of risk and benefit surrounding weight-loss surgery.,"While the story begins with a small research study about two different methods of weight-loss surgery, it expands and includes context about wider debate over whether shedding pounds improves health and life expectancy.

For one, teens need more sleep than adults: about eight or nine hours a night, compared with about the six or seven their parents require. Teens, biologically, really do crave sleep.\n\nWhich is a problem when it comes to education. Most high schools start before 8 am to help parents get to work by 9 am. Early school start times also give kids more time for after-school activities like sports or theater.\n\nBut that has consequences: Around 69 percent of high school students get less than eight hours of sleep on a school night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which puts these teens at risk of negative impacts on health.\n\nThere may be a simple fix: Start schools at a later time.\n\nThis is a solution supported by both the America Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AMA urges schools to start no earlier than 8:30 am. In 2014, the Academy of Pediatrics wrote that “the urgency and the magnitude of the problem of sleep loss in adolescents” warranted big changes in school start times.\n\nBut it’s not a foregone conclusion that later start times will ensure teens sleep more. Later start times could lead teens to go to bed even later. Or parents might still wake them up early. When it made its recommendation, the Academy of Pediatrics admitted “it is clear that additional research is needed to further document the effects of changes in school start times over time.”\n\nWell, there’s some new (but still incomplete) evidence that later start times do help teens get more sleep.\n\nA new meta-analysis in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine analyzed 18 studies on start times. It finds that when school starts up to an hour later, students typically do get around 19 minutes more sleep, on average. When start times are delayed more than an hour, that average increases to 53 minutes of extra sleep.\n\nThe study also found some preliminary evidence that later school start times were associated with better mental health outcomes. Only five of the 18 studies included these measures, but in two of them, later start time was associated with better (self-reported) feelings of depression and irritability.\n\nMore work needs to be done to confirm these findings. But even if later school start times only improve sleep time, that’s a positive step for public health. Because if later school start times can truly help students sleep better, the research suggests that better sleep would lead to major improvements to their health and well-being.\n\nTeens tend to be night owls, and forcing them to be early birds can mess with their health\n\nTeens tend to go to sleep a bit later and wake up a bit later than the average adult — something called a “delayed” sleep phase. For most teens, it means their whole biological clock is shifted, and if they wake up too early, their body will be out of sync with the rest of the world. “Every neurotransmitter, hormone, and chemical in the body cycles with the daily rhythm,"" Philip Gehrman, a sleep researcher and clinician at the University of Pennsylvania, told me earlier in the year.\n\nWhen your body clock is off from society’s, scientists call it “social jet lag.” And like the jet lag from a long journey, it messes with your body.\n\nStudies of adults find that social jet lag is associated with higher BMI, insulin resistance, depression, and a higher likelihood to engage in dangerous behaviors like smoking. And the group of people most at risk for social jet lag? Teens.\n\nIn a tightly controlled lab study, 24 healthy adult participants* who had their sleep shifted by one hour each day (simulating jet lag) started to look prediabetic after a three-week trial. Their resting metabolic rates dropped 8 percent. ""Assuming no changes in activity or food intake,"" that ""would translate into ~12.5 pounds increase in weight over a single year,"" the study, published in Science Translational Medicine in 2012, concluded.\n\nRead more\n\nPeople with a lot of social jet lag also tend to get fewer hours of sleep, which exacerbates these same health problems. On top of that, short sleep reduces powers of perception, concentration, and judgment. There’s some evidence that when students sleep better, they perform better in school as well.\n\n(*A lot of the studies on social jet lag and short sleep use adults as their participants. But as the American Academy of Pediatrics reports, studies do also find an association between short sleep and obesity in adolescents.)\n\nDelaying school start times is easier said than done\n\nAs Vox’s Libby Nelson has reported, very few schools have actually adopted this reform. This map, which reflects the most recent CDC data available, shows that across the country, schools still start very early.\n\nThere are some understandable reasons why. Nelson writes:\n\n...the problem is usually logistics. Students of all ages usually share the same fleet of buses. High school students get the first shift, and the buses circle back to pick up their younger siblings later in the morning. Most districts don\'t want elementary school students to have to wait in the dark for buses early in the morning — nor do they want to pay for a separate fleet of school buses for elementary and middle school kids. Breaking with tradition turns out to be costly.\n\nAnd even though the evidence is mostly in favor of increasing school start times, it isn’t a slam dunk quite yet.\n\nThere are some limitations to mention about the new meta-analysis. The studies mostly used self-reported measures of sleep duration. (More objective measures — like those obtained from Fitbit-like wristbands — are more accurate.) And many of the studies were short in duration, comparing sleep duration in snapshots before and after a school made a switch. More data would show whether the impact of school start time on sleep waned or improved over time.\n\n“The aggregated quality of the evidence,” the study reports, “is only moderate.” The researchers also found no effect on academic performance. Furthermore, two of the studies found evidence that earlier start times were associated with increased vehicle accidents involving the teens. Being tired in the morning can be a dangerous distraction while on the road.\n\nIn all, the researchers call for more rigorous data on the topic. As schools change their start times, they write, researchers should sweep in to collect information on students’ sleep in a standardized way.\n\nRegardless, it’s a promising area for study. Because if later school start times can truly help students sleep better, the research suggests that better sleep would lead to major improvements to their health and well-being.']","But, no sources appear to have been interviewed for this story, though it contains a lot of citations to studies and quotes used in past stories.","It is clear that too little sleep is bad for humans, and health officials have long recommended that teenagers get eight to nine hours of sleep a night, a suggestion made difficult by early start times (often before 8 a.m.) in America’s schools. But how good is the evidence for the effects of later high school start times on students? A group of researchers conducted a meta-analysis and concluded that the evidence is not very strong. Among the 287 relevant studies found, only 18 (6%) were of good enough to quality for inclusion, and while those studies yielded some evidence for beneficial effects (later start times do seem to result in longer periods of sleep, for example), the researchers had a hard time finding links between later start times and both academic performance and behavioral issues.
The overall evidence, they concluded, is just too weak. Initially, the Vox story seems to ignore this take-away, especially with the headline that starting school later “might really help.” Later, the story does go on to explain some of the limitations of existing studies and includes the researchers’ call for more rigorous data.  Whether those cautionary comments, sitting at the end of the story, will help readers evaluate these results is hard to say.

It’s making them fit and healthy.”\n\n\n\nThe UK’s National Health Service recommends that to ward off an early death, people should spend 150 minutes a week performing moderate exercise, or 75 minutes a week doing vigorous exercise. As a rule of thumb, moderate exercise can be done while maintaining a conversation, whereas during vigorous exercise talking at the same time is too hard.\n\n\n\nIn the study, those who met the physical activity target by exercising through the week had a 35% lower risk of death than the inactive adults, with cardiovascular deaths down 41% and a 21% lower risk of cancer death.\n\n\n\nBut the weekend warriors also saw substantial health benefits if they met the physical activity target too. Their overall risk of death was 30% lower than the sedentary adults, with the risk of cardiovascular and cancer deaths lower by 40% and 18% respectively.\n\n\n\nThe joy of steps: why humans are built to get a high from being on the move Read more\n\n“Weekend warriors are people who meet the recommended volume of physical activity each week through only one or two sessions. There are doing a large proportion of vigorous exercise and that makes you fitter than moderate exercise,” said O’Donovan. Men and women benefited equally, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association: Internal Medicine.\n\n\n\nThe results are based on medical data gathered for 63,591 adults aged 40 and above between 1994 and 2012. Nearly 9,000 of the study participants died in the period.\n\n\n\nFor those who have resolved to get fit in the New Year, O’Donovan recommends to start with moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, and then to set realistic, incremental goals to boost confidence without running the risk of setbacks due to injury. “A middle aged or older person should do as much as 12 weeks of moderate exercise before introducing vigorous exercise,” he said.\n\n\n\nUlf Ekelund at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo said the study emphasised what researchers have found time and again: that even a small amount of regular exercise wards off death. In the study, those who exercised a little had a 29% lower risk of death than those who did no exercise at all. “The novel finding is that it appears the duration, and possibly the intensity, of leisure time physical activity is more important than the frequency,” Ekelund said.\n\n\n\n“My take home message is that the greatest risk reduction and the greatest gain for the individual and for public health is if those who are physically inactive take up some activity,” he added.\n\n']","But, we were pleased to see the inclusion of an independent source, who helped establish what was novel about the study findings.","
This story looks at an observational study comparing frequency of exercise vs no exercise on early risk of death, with an emphasis placed on “weekend warrior” style exercise.
Like we saw in our review of Newsweek’s take on this study, this story from The UK Guardian confuses association with causation. It also didn’t mention any of the study’s limitations, which were plentiful.
However, we were pleased to see the inclusion of an independent source, who helped establish what was novel about the study findings.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner\n\nThe result is likely to surprise many skeptics who did not believe insulin could be delivered orally because they doubted it could survive the onslaught of digestive juices so it could have the intended effect.\n\nOramed uses a protective coating and a high-enough dose of insulin so that most of it can be destroyed and still deliver a clinically beneficial amount of the hormone.\n\nThe positive results must be replicated in a larger Phase III trial before the drug, known as ORMD-0801, can be submitted for approval. But the data from the Phase II, 180-patient trial represents a major milestone.\n\n“It’s been a long trip but it’s finally at the point that it’s beyond a doubt, the oral insulin works,” Nadav Kidron, chief executive of Jerusalem-based Oramed, said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe 28-day study involved patients whose type 2 diabetes was not adequately controlled by metformin. They were dosed before bed time and had their overnight glucose levels continuously monitored. Those who received the oral insulin had a mean night-time glucose reduction of nearly 6.5 percent compared with a placebo.\n\nThere were no reported serious adverse side effects and no issues with hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar, the company said. Oramed said it plans to publish more detailed data from the study once it has had time to analyze the full results.\n\nWhile insulin is typically associated with type 1 diabetes, many patients with type 2 eventually see their disease progress to the point where they need insulin. Type 2 accounts for more than 90 percent of the nearly 400 million people with diabetes worldwide.\n\nA safe and effective oral insulin, if approved, is expected to become a multibillion-dollar product.\n\nThe main attraction of an insulin pill, aside from avoiding injections, is that it comes much closer to the path of natural insulin, which is produced in the pancreas and goes directly to the liver. ORMD-0801 goes from the gut to the liver, while injected insulin circulates throughout the body before it gets there.\n\nSome doctors believe high levels of insulin circulating through the rest of the body may increase health risks.""]",Given the nature of the research–unpublished and coming directly from a pharmaceutical company–an outside source would have made this story stronger.,"This is a brief story on findings from a phase II trial of a new oral insulin medication conducted by Oramed, a pharmaceutical company.
The story gives us the basics on the study design and findings. It’s made clear that the drug must undergo further testing before it’s approved for use.
The only commentary, though, was from the CEO. Given the nature of the research–unpublished and coming directly from a pharmaceutical company–an outside source would have made this story stronger. (We also reviewed the news release this story seems to be based on.)

Carroll answered readers’ questions about this article in a follow-up here.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my parents refused to let me drink coffee because they believed it would “stunt my growth.” It turns out, of course, that this is a myth. Studies have failed, again and again, to show that coffee or caffeine consumption are related to reduced bone mass or how tall people are.\n\nCoffee has long had a reputation as being unhealthy. But in almost every single respect that reputation is backward. The potential health benefits are surprisingly large.\n\nWhen I set out to look at the research on coffee and health, I thought I’d see it being associated with some good outcomes and some bad ones, mirroring the contradictory reports you can often find in the news media. This didn’t turn out to be the case.\n\nJust last year, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies looking at long-term consumption of coffee and the risk of cardiovascular disease was published. The researchers found 36 studies involving more than 1,270,000 participants. The combined data showed that those who consumed a moderate amount of coffee, about three to five cups a day, were at the lowest risk for problems. Those who consumed five or more cups a day had no higher risk than those who consumed none.']",This column recounts a laundry list of observational studies showing health benefits of coffee consumption without ever delving into the limitations of such research.,"
Clearly the health effects of coffee is a topic of huge public interest given that coffee is central to our culture, our morning routine, and our social lives — and likely one of the most commonly consumed beverages on the planet. This report includes links to numerous meta-analyses about the effects of coffee on a wide range of health impacts including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, liver disease, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The underlying assumption is that coffee has a bad rap that is not deserved, given the vast amount of evidence that has accumulated about its potential benefits over the years. One might be tempted to pour an additional cup every morning if, as the article suggests: “the potential health benefits are surprisingly large.”
While this is a compelling and intriguing report that reflects considerable research by the author, one can’t help but think it suffers from a bit of confirmation bias which is described as: “the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one’s beliefs or hypotheses.” Seems that when the Times went out to look for research on the effects of coffee — both the good and the bad — the bad wasn’t generally found. What would have helped was some sense of bias that might creep into the available coffee-related research, that it is mostly observational, and hence subject to a variety of limitations that are less likely found in randomized studies. Nearly every study of coffee consumption relies on peoples’ perceptions and recall of how much coffee they thought they drank, and we know that recall bias would affect all of those studies where self-reported behaviors are being measured. What the reader needs, up front, in an article such as this is a more rigorous probing of the common confounders in observational research, the potential for bias (including publication bias, reporting bias, social responsibility bias, and others) and so on. We suspect that there may even be healthy user bias and the possibility, even remote, that the people who respond to surveys about how much coffee they drink are not representative of the general population and hence the study results are less likely to be seen in the “real world.”

967,story_reviews_01534,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/2935/,2010-06-15 04:00:00,Eating Brown Rice to Cut Diabetes Risk,"['Francesco Tonelli for The New York Times\n\nNext time you order takeout wonton soup and a spicy Number 82, you might want to make sure it comes with brown rice.\n\nBrown rice is a whole grain — white rice before it has been refined and polished and stripped of the bran covering, which is high in fiber and nutrients. Brown rice also has a lower glycemic index than white rice, which means it doesn’t cause blood glucose levels to rise as rapidly.\n\nNow a new study from researchers at Harvard reports that Americans who eat two or more servings of brown rice a week reduce their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by about 10 percent compared to people who eat it less than once a month. And those who eat white rice on a regular basis — five or more times a week — are almost 20 percent more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than those who eat it less than once a month.\n\nJust replacing a third of a serving of white rice with brown each day could reduce one’s risk of Type 2 diabetes by 16 percent, a statistical analysis showed. A serving is half a cup of cooked rice.\n\nThe study, which was published in The Archives of Internal Medicine and used data from two Harvard nurses’ health studies and a separate study of health professionals, isn’t the first to point a finger at foods like white rice as a culprit in Type 2 diabetes. A 2007 study of Chinese women in Shanghai found that middle-aged women who ate large amounts of white rice and other refined carbohydrates were also at increased risk for diabetes compared to their peers who ate less.\n\nBut the Harvard study is one of the first to distinguish between brown rice and white rice consumption in the United States, where rice is not a staple food and relatively little is eaten overall, said Dr. Qi Sun, an instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Many food studies simply lump brown and white rice together.\n\n“The bottom line is we showed evidence that increased consumption of white rice – even at this low level of intake — is still associated with increased risk,” said Dr. Sun, who was at the Harvard School of Public Health when the study was done. “It’s really recommended to replace white rice with the same amount of brown rice or other whole grains.”\n\nThe researchers who did the study analyzed rice consumption among 39,765 men and 57,463 women who participated in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses’ Health Study I and II; participants in the three groups ranged in age from 26 to 87.\n\nThey had filled out food frequency questionnaires when the studies started — in 1986, 1984 and 1991, respectively — and updated their diet information every four years subsequently, through 2005 and 2006. They were also asked about their medical histories. During the course of the studies, more than 10,000 participants developed Type 2 diabetes.\n\nSuch food studies can be unreliable, since they rely on self-reported surveys. And correlation does not necessarily mean a cause-and-effect relationship, since factors other than brown rice consumption may have accounted for the decreased diabetes risk that was observed. The researchers tried to control for the fact that Americans who eat brown rice tend to be more healthy overall — they eat more fruits and vegetables and less red meat and trans fats, and they also tend to be thinner, more active and less likely to smoke than those who don’t eat brown rice.\n\nBut, Dr. Sun said, there were many possible explanations for why brown rice eaters are at lower risk for Type 2 diabetes. In addition to having a lower glycemic index than white rice, brown rice also contains important nutrients like magnesium that are stripped during the refining process; it also contains much more fiber. Earlier studies have found that having these nutrients in the diet protects against diabetes, Dr. Sun said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified the amount of cooked rice in a serving. A serving is one-quarter cup of uncooked rice, or about half a cup when cooked.']",Citing only relative risk reduction figures can tend to make the results look more impressive than they might appear if the absolute risk reduction figures were given.  That’s our biggest beef with this rice story.  ,"The headline alone seems to imply a definitive causal relationship that this study can’t prove – a point made, but not until almost the end of the story.  This could have been a story about much more than just the color of rice – even with a few lines.  Instead, it focused on a lot of numbers that may not have helped consumer comprehension very much.

Some patients were continuing to respond to T-VEC three years later.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPatients with stage III and early stage IV melanoma treated with T-VEC (163 people in all) lived an average of 41 months. This compared with an average survival of 21.5 months in the 66 earlier-stage patients who received the control immunotherapy. Immunotherapy, where agents are used to boost a body\'s natural defense against a tumor, are already the best treatments against melanoma. But this is the first time a modified virus has been successful in carrying out that treatment.\n\nUsing a virus as a drug isn\'t a new idea. Phage therapy, where viruses that attack certain bacteria are used in place of antibiotics, is commonly used in Europe and on the rise in the United States. But cancer therapies like the one described in the new paper take things a step further, manipulating existing viruses to turn them into cancer-fighting tools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research and head of the trial, has been working on this particular virus for about a decade. Before he signed onto the project, it was primarily being investigated as a breast cancer treatment. But Harrington brought head, neck, and skin cancer patients into the mix, and melanoma seemed to have the best responses of all.\n\nHere\'s how T-VEC works: It starts with the herpes virus, which is magnificent at proliferating itself within cells and then causing them to burst (that\'s where the cold sores come from). But T-VEC has had two key genes removed. These keep it from replicating within healthy cells, which can quickly spot it because of the missing genes.\n\nBut cancer cells aren\'t as savvy, and T-VEC has its run of them. Meanwhile, T-VEC has also been modified to produce a molecule called GM-CSF, which serves as a red flag waved at the immune system.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo in addition to the destructive power of the T-VEC cells themselves, the therapy summons the immune system right to where it\'s needed -- the tumor.\n\n""This is a first in class agent, a brand new therapy,"" Harrington said. ""But it\'s just the farthest along of what we hope will be many more.""\n\nHarrington expects the FDA to clear T-VEC within the year, and it could potentially be available to patients right away.\n\nBut there\'s more work to be done to determine just how T-VEC can fit into the cancer-treatment landscape. When the latest trial was started, Harrington explained, there was no standard of treatment for melanoma -- so it\'s compared to a treatment that no one expected to outpace T-VEC. Now that other therapies -- ones that target specific mutations in patients\' cancer cells -- are showing more success than what was available when the trial was formed, researchers will have to see how T-VEC compares.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n""The next steps are exciting, and already underway,"" he said. ""The next big frontier will be to combine this with existing immunotherapies. There\'s a strong rationale that other drugs on the market could act synogistically with ours.""\n\nTrials are also underway to determine how T-VEC might do with other cancers. In the meantime, other researchers will continue to crack the codes of other viruses to make them do our bidding.\n\nWant more science? Give these a click:\n\nAD']","This story provided a rosier picture of the benefit than was warranted. The appropriate overall survival statistic to report would have been the median survival rate in the entire population, not the average survival.","This blog post discusses the stage III trial of an Amgen treatment for melanoma, T-VEC, that is derived from the Herpes Simpex 1 virus. The modified virus does two things. It has been genetically altered to infiltrate cancer cells (but not healthy cells) where it bursts the cell membranes. The virus has also been programmed to produce a signaling chemical for the immune system to highlight the cancer location.
We’d highlight two specific suggestions for improvement in this otherwise informative story. First, the story implies that the drug is only months away from being available to patients. Though the manufacturer and authors of the study may hope this is the case, they have no way of knowing for certain. For desperate patients, such statements may lead to false hope. Second, the article provides a rosier picture of the benefit of this treatment than it should have. The appropriate overall survival statistic to report would have been the median survival rate in the entire population, 23 vs. 19 months. Though this is a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference, it isn’t quite as dramatic as the average survival improvement of 41 vs. 21.5 months that is reported in the story. See our review comments for details on why median survival is more informative.

Now, researchers say a special scoring system might point to those people at highest risk for colon cancer, who may need the test the most.\n\nThe system might also make colon cancer screening more efficient and boost the number of people who get checked for the disease, said a team led by Dr. Thomas Imperiale of Indiana University Medical Center, in Indianapolis.\n\nOne expert said more efforts are needed to get people to undergo colonoscopy, which is currently recommended once every 10 years beginning at age 50.\n\n""Five percent of the U.S. population will be diagnosed with colon cancer within their lifetimes,"" said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was not involved in the new research.\n\nSwaminath noted that one study published in 2012 found that ""colonoscopy reduced the risk of death from colon cancer by 53 percent, by removing polyps. No other procedure is available to remove polyps from anywhere in the colon.""\n\nAnd while some areas of the United States have rates of compliance with colonoscopy guidelines of 75 percent or more, ""many areas have poor colon cancer screening rates,"" he added.\n\nImperiale\'s team noted that not all people deemed to be at ""average risk"" for colon cancer face the same risk of the disease, and so some might benefit more from invasive colonoscopy than others.\n\nIn the new study, the Indiana researchers looked at more than 4,400 Americans who were scheduled to undergo their first screening colonoscopy. They calculated a clinical ""score"" for each of these patients, based on their health information, and the five most common risk factors for colon cancer: age, sex, waist size, smoking and family history.\n\nThen they looked at the results of each patient\'s colonoscopy. The study found that patients classified under the scoring system as low-risk did, in fact, have far fewer advanced abnormal growths that might develop into cancer, compared to patients classified as high-risk.\n\nSo, patients scoring at the lower end of risk for colon cancer might be able to have less invasive screening tests (such as the fecal occult blood test), while those at higher risk would require a colonoscopy, Imperiale\'s team concluded.\n\nHowever, Swaminath wasn\'t fully sold on the notion.\n\nHe believes that the scoring system ""was only modestly able to separate people within the risk groups."" Swaminath pointed out that even the new study found that ""low- to intermediate-risk patients still have a risk between of between 1.9 percent to 9.9 percent of harboring a polyp that can develop into cancer.""\n\nFor now, he said, the data from this study is not strong enough to spur any changes in current screening recommendations.\n\nDr. Jules Garbus is co-chief of colon and rectal surgery at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. He seemed more supportive of the new scoring system.\n\n""A risk stratification tool is critical in helping physicians make appropriate screening recommendations for patients,"" Garbus said. ""While high-risk patients may ultimately require a screening colonoscopy, many average- and low-risk patients could undergo less invasive screening procedures. This can improve patient compliance with screening, as well as address escalating health care cost issues.\n\nThe study is published Aug. 10 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about colorectal cancer screening.']",Strong effort featuring two outside perspectives. Looking at alternatives would have opened up another fruitful avenue of inquiry for the coverage.,"Can a new scoring system help some people avoid a colonoscopy?
This is an important story that touches on all sorts of issues involved in public health, including how to best to screen for a disease that takes a terrible toll, how to determine who is at highest risk and how to get the best use out of a test (colonoscopy) that is both expensive and invasive.
The story does a good job summarizing the study authors’ efforts to devise a scoring algorithm that might answer some of those questions, but makes only perfunctory references to cost and doesn’t acknowledge the long history of similar calculators that have been developed and never widely used. That’s pertinent context for this new effort. Despite leaving some room for improvement, the story makes a strong effort at interpreting a relatively simple algorithm with complex ramifications, and draws on two outside experts for perspective — something we wish more stories would take the time to do.

But in some individuals too many platelets are produced – a condition known as thrombocytosis, thought to affect about half a million people in the UK over the age of 40.\n\nResearchers say that raised platelet counts are as good a predictor of getting any cancer as a lump in the breast is for breast cancer.\n\n“This is a clue which can be used in practice by GPs to help them select patients for further investigation … most excitingly in some patients who may not already have other symptoms of cancer to achieve earlier diagnosis,” said Sarah Bailey, co-author of the research from the University of Exeter.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested a link between thrombocytosis and various cancers, with recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advising high platelet counts could be a sign of cancer of the oesophageal, stomach, lung or uterus.\n\nBut it remained unclear whether the condition could signal an increased risk of all cancers, and how it ties in with factors such as age and sex.\n\nCan you manufacture blood cells? Read more\n\nWriting in the British Journal of General Practice, Bailey and colleagues report how they examined data from almost 50,000 individuals aged 40 or over who had been given a blood test by their GP. The patients were selected at random from a national database.\n\nIn total, over 31,000 patients found to have a raised platelet count, and nearly 8,000 without, were included in the analysis.\n\nWithin a year of the blood test, the team found that cancer was more common among those who had thrombocytosis: 11.6% of men and 6.2% of women were found to have cancer compared to 4.1% of men and 2.2% of women without a raised platelet count. In the general population about 1% of individuals over the age of 40 develop cancer each year.\n\nFor comparison, among women aged between 50 and 59 who have discovered a breast lump, the proportion who are found to have breast cancer is 8.5%.\n\n\n\n“We found cancer was more commonly diagnosed in men with raised platelet counts than it was in women with raised platelet counts and we believe that is because there are more causes of raised platelet counts in women that are not cancer,” said Bailey.\n\nThe team add that cancer was more common among for those who had thrombocytosis for longer. Of the men who had a raised platelet count of the same value or higher six months after being diagnosed with thrombocytosis, 18.1% developed cancer, while for women the figure was 10.1%.\n\nWhile many different types of cancer were present in both groups, the team found that breast and prostate cancers were less common among those with thrombocytosis than in the general population, while lung and colorectal cancers were more common.\n\nFor about a third of cases of lung and colorectal cancer in patients with thrombocytosis, there had been no other symptoms that raised the suggestion of cancer. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year.\n\nRichard Neal, professor of primary care oncology at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.\n\n“This is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,” he said.\n\n“This work should begin to change practice, so that GPs should be testing patients with raised platelet counts for cancer, especially those without other potential cancer symptoms,” he added.\n\nDr Jasmine Just, Cancer Research UK’s health information officer, said more research was need to confirm whether further tests following a high platelet count would save lives.\n\n“There are lots of possible reasons a person’s platelet count might be high, and in most cases it won’t be down to cancer,” she added.\n\n“Measuring platelet count in patients who don’t otherwise warrant a blood test is not necessarily a good idea. But if a patient has a blood test for another reason and a high platelet count is found, then one of the possible diagnoses doctors should consider is cancer.”']","The story’s headline–“High Blood Platelet Count ‘As Good A Cancer Predictor as a Lump in the Breast”–is unfortunate, though, because it suggests to the reader that the blood test is a test for breast cancer (it isn’t a test for any specific cancer or any cancer period) and infers that most breast lumps are cancerous (the vast majority are not).","With the exception of a misleading and somewhat hyped headline, this British newspaper story fairly describes results of some data-mining research that adds strength to previously observed associations between a form of seriously elevated blood platelet levels (thrombocytosis) and some types of cancer.
Researchers at the University of Exeter claim its findings are solid enough to help general practitioners use commonly done blood tests that happen to include platelet counts as clues to earlier diagnosis of unsuspected cancer in adults patients — clues akin to a woman finding a breast lump that needs a biopsy — while also making clear that such patients would need “further investigation.”
The headline “High Blood Platelet Count ‘As Good A Cancer Predictor as a Lump in the Breast” is unfortunate because it suggests to the reader that the blood test is a test for breast cancer (it isn’t a test for any specific cancer or any cancer period) and infers that most breast lumps are cancerous (the vast majority are not). We also wished the story’s appropriate cautions and caveats about the use of platelet counts clinically were included much higher up in the text. But, to its credit, the story used quotes from third parties to make clear that more research is needed to confirm the new findings, that routine platelet testing is not what’s called for here, and that elevated platelet levels are potential markers but not at all proof of the presence of cancer.

But now the Food and Drug Administration has evaluated the safety of the second generation of silicone implants and the results are mixed.\n\nAn FDA report, released in late June, says silicone implants are generally safe. But complications from implants are frequent — things like hardening of the skin around the implant; ruptured, wrinkled, or lopsided implants; scarring, pain and infection.\n\nAs many as half of patients will need to have additional surgeries or have the implants removed in the first decade.\n\nIt also turns out that the longer a woman has the implants, the more likely she is to experience these complications.\n\nRuptured Implants Can Require Surgery\n\nTake Kate Marion. She had silicone implants for breast augmentation in her late 20s. Just shy of two decades later she noticed something unusual.\n\n""When I was crossing my left arm across my body — for instance, to put lotion on my right arm — I would make a little noise from my armpit, the way little boys do when they stick their hand in their armpit and pump their arm up and down,"" Marion says. ""A little tooty noise.""\n\nAn MRI showed both her implants had burst. Her doctor immediately recommended removing them, which she did. Marion hasn\'t suffered any apparent harm from her ruptured implants, and she even confesses to having an occasional twinge of regret that she didn\'t have them replaced when she had the old ones removed. But ultimately she decided she didn\'t want to go through more surgery.\n\nThere is a huge deficiency of long-term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in, the more problems...occur.\n\n""Well, how long would these next ones last? I would be in my 60s when I had to do this again, and who wants to have surgery unnecessarily when you are 60 something?"" says Marion.\n\nAlthough the long-term effects of silicone in the body are still uncertain, many plastic surgeons don\'t see the leaking of modern implants as a health concern.\n\n""The actual silicone that\'s within the implants is inert. So if the silicone gel leaks, it doesn\'t travel through the body, it doesn\'t cause systemic problems. So the MRI is really detecting a cosmetic concern,"" says New York City plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman.\n\nOily Silicone Versus Gel\n\nBut there have been more serious outcomes. Annette Knecht got silicone implants in 1991 following a double mastectomy. For years afterward she felt ill, suffered multiple bouts of pneumonia, had trouble breathing and pain in her chest. Doctors reassured her it wasn\'t her implants.\n\n""We had a CT scan done, and it showed OK — everything looked fine, so we didn\'t worry about it,"" says Knecht.\n\nBut no one ever told her to get an MRI — something the FDA now recommends that women with silicone implants get every few years. As it turned out, Knecht\'s implants had leaked; a biopsy found silicone in her lymph nodes and in her lungs. She is currently disabled and awaiting a lung transplant — all, she says, for vanity.\n\n""We\'re about four generations removed from those implants,"" says Schulman, the plastic surgeon. He explains that implants have undergone big changes since the early 1990s, when Knecht received hers. Back then they contained a runny liquid silicone.\n\n""The silicone implants of today are what we call a cohesive gel — it\'s essentially like a jelly. So the jelly may ooze a little bit, but it will not run out like an oil,"" says Schulman.\n\nSid Wolf of the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen is among critics who point out that the data in the FDA report sample just a fraction of the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Moreover, that data are limited to just the last two or three years — not enough, Wolf says, to make any real claims about the long-term safety of the implants.\n\n""There is a huge deficiency of long-term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in, the more problems ... occur,"" says Wolf.\n\nThousands Still Choosing Silicone\n\nStill, there are plenty of satisfied customers among the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Not only have the number of women choosing breast implants for augmentation risen by nearly 40 percent in the last decade, Schulman says that in his practice, 80 percent of them are choosing silicone over saline. What\'s more, he says few of them follow the recommendations to get routine MRIs to screen for leaks.\n\nSchulman says that the rates of complications for silicone implants are roughly the same as for saline — though he feels these complications can be minimized by choosing an experienced surgeon. Still, he warns his patients that no procedure is without risks — and additional surgeries are a very real possibility.\n\n""Your young breast implants don\'t last forever,"" says Schulman. ""They may leak, they may rupture, you may decide you want a different size. So you have to at least expect that sometime in your life, you are going to need a reoperation. And if you are 100 percent against having another surgery related to these implants, then it\'s something you should reconsider.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story discusses common risks of silicone but misses some big concerns, and is sketchy on costs, actual data on safety, and alternatives. </span>","400,000 women have breast implants each year and use is rising. This story was about where we are today with silicone. The use is on the rise but have we really settled the question about safety? The article kind of skirts the scary issues like the autoimmune disease and focuses on the common complications (which are much higher than perhaps people recognized). The story missed a chance to dig into the data and to help women really understand the issue more deeply. Instead, we hear a lot from one plastic surgeon who presents his own point of view.
We would have liked more data, less opinion.

A pharmaceutical company is unlikely to fund a study that doesn’t involve a drug, and in any event, the research requires a large group of volunteers tracked over a very long time.\n\nThe subjects must provide health measurements at the outset, learn the proper poses, continue to do them regularly for years and be regularly evaluated.\n\nNo one knows these challenges better than Dr. Loren M. Fishman, a physiatrist at Columbia University who specializes in rehabilitative medicine. For years, he has been gathering evidence on yoga and bone health, hoping to determine whether yoga might be an effective therapy for osteoporosis.\n\nThe idea is not widely accepted in the medical community, but then, researchers know comparatively little about complementary medicine in general. So in 2005, Dr. Fishman began a small pilot study of yoga moves that turned up some encouraging results. Eleven practitioners had increased bone density in their spine and hips, he reported in 2009, compared with seven controls who did not practice yoga.\n\nKnowing that more than 700,000 spinal fractures and more than 300,000 hip fractures occur annually in the United States, Dr. Fishman hoped that similar findings from a much larger study might convince doctors that this low-cost and less dangerous alternative to bone-loss drugs is worth pursuing.\n\nThose medications can produce adverse side effects like gastrointestinal distress and fractures of the femur. Indeed, a recent study published in Clinical Interventions in Aging found that among 126,188 women found to have osteoporosis, all of whom had Medicare Part D drug coverage, only 28 percent started bone drug therapy within a year of diagnosis.\n\nMany of those who avoided drugs were trying to avoid gastrointestinal problems.\n\nOn the other hand, yoga’s “side effects,” Dr. Fishman and colleagues wrote recently, “include better posture, improved balance, enhanced coordination, greater range of motion, higher strength, reduced levels of anxiety and better gait.”\n\nWeight-bearing activity is often recommended to patients with bone loss, and Dr. Fishman argues that certain yoga positions fit the bill.\n\n“Yoga puts more pressure on bone than gravity does,” he said in an interview. “By opposing one group of muscles against another, it stimulates osteocytes, the bone-making cells.”\n\nMost experts argue that it’s difficult, perhaps impossible, for adults to gain significant bone mass. Undeterred, Dr. Fishman invested a chunk of his own money and with three collaborators — Yi-Hsueh Lu of The Rockefeller University, Bernard Rosner of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Dr. Gregory Chang of New York University — solicited volunteers worldwide via the Internet for a follow-up to his small pilot study.\n\nOf the 741 people who joined his experiment from 2005 to 2015, 227 (202 of them women) followed through with doing the 12 assigned yoga poses daily or at least every other day. The average age of the 227 participants upon joining the study was 68, and 83 percent had osteoporosis or its precursor, osteopenia.\n\nThe 12 poses, by their English names, were tree, triangle, warrior II, side-angle, twisted triangle, locust, bridge, supine hand-to-foot I, supine hand-to-foot II, straight-legged twist, bent-knee twist and corpse pose. Each pose was held for 30 seconds. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete.\n\nThe researchers collected data at the start of the study on the participants’ bone density measurements, blood and urine chemistry and X-rays of their spines and hips. They were each given a DVD of the 12 yoga poses used in the pilot study and an online program in which to record what they did and how often.\n\nA decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. The findings, as reported last month in Topics of Geriatric Rehabilitation, showed improved bone density in the spine and femur of the 227 participants who were moderately or fully compliant with the assigned yoga exercises.\n\nImprovements were seen in bone density in the hip as well, but they were not statistically significant.\n\nBefore the study, the participants had had 109 fractures, reported by them or found on X-rays.\n\nAt the time the study was submitted for publication, “with more than 90,000 hours of yoga practiced largely by people with osteoporosis or osteopenia, there have been no reported or X-ray detected fractures or serious injuries of any kind related to the practice of yoga in any of the 741 participants,” Dr. Fishman and his colleagues wrote.\n\n“Yoga looks like it’s safe, even for people who have suffered significant bone loss,” Dr. Fishman said in an interview.\n\nFurthermore, a special study of bone quality done on 18 of the participants showed that they had “better internal support of their bones, which is not measured by a bone density scan but is important to resisting fractures,” Dr. Fishman said.\n\nThe study has many limitations, including the use of self-selected volunteers and the lack of a control group. But all told, the team concluded, the results may lend support to Dr. Fishman’s long-held belief that yoga can help reverse bone loss.\n\nEven if bone density did not increase, improvements in posture and balance that can accrue from the practice of yoga can be protective, Dr. Fishman said.\n\n“Spinal fractures can result from poor posture, and there’s no medication for that, but yoga is helpful,” he said.\n\nIn addition, “Yoga is good for range of motion, strength, coordination and reduced anxiety,” he said, “all of which contribute to the ability to stay upright and not fall. If you don’t fall, you greatly reduce your risk of a serious fracture.”\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.']","This report never really says how much people’s bone density improved with daily yoga, but the coverage includes some important caveats about the research.","This is a thorough and balanced report of research into the effects of yoga on bone density. While yoga provides a range of potential health benefits including increased flexibility, balance and strength (all factors which can help prevent falls and fractures), the researchers focused specifically on whether a 12 minute per day yoga routine could increase bone density.  Although improvements were found after a decade of research, helpful caveats about the limitations of the study (lack of a control group, self-reported nature of the study) kept it away from the realm of exaggeration.

But most insurers won\'t pay for it, because they consider it experimental.\n\nStudies have given conflicting results, partly because there\'s no standardized way of doing shock-wave therapy. Different doctors use different sources of energy, different doses and a differing number of treatments.\n\n""Is it rock-solid science that everyone agrees on? I would say no,"" says Dr. Naven Duggal, another Harvard orthopedic surgeon at Boston\'s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\nDuggal is not impressed with reported success rates.\n\n""Sixty to 80 percent [success] for something that somebody\'s not going to get guaranteed pain relief -- in my mind, it\'s not something I would go for,"" Duggal says.\n\nDuggal says foot specialists don\'t really know what causes the pain of plantar fasciitis.\n\nThe plantar fascia is a tough, rubber-band-like structure on the bottom of the foot.\n\nIt has to be strong, because every time the foot strikes the ground, the plantar fascia bears the body\'s full weight. In high-impact activities like running, the forces even exceed the actual weight because it\'s so concentrated in a narrow spot where the fascia attaches to the heel bone. That\'s presumably why sufferers of plantar fasciitis feel the pain in the heel.\n\ntoggle caption Richard Knox/NPR\n\nConcepts of what plantar fasciitis is have changed in recent years. Doctors used to think it occurred because the fascia became inflamed –- in fact, the suffix ""-itis"" denotes inflammation. But while inflammation can be involved in plantar fasciitis, it doesn\'t seem to be the cause, Duggal says.\n\nMany think that plantar fasciitis is caused by heel spurs, bony hook-like growths that develop on many people\'s heels due to stress. But specialists don\'t think that anymore.\n\nAs ideas of what plantar fasciitis is change, so have treatments. Doctors don\'t do surgery for it anymore except in rare cases, largely because they\'ve found surgery often makes people worse off.\n\n""Patients have to be patient,"" Duggal says. ""They have to understand that this condition unfortunately is not fully understood.""\n\nHe\'s interested in another experimental treatment that\'s just entering clinical trials. It\'s called platelet-rich plasma, and it involves isolating blood cells called platelets from patients\' own blood and injecting them into the plantar fascia. Though platelets are best known for their role in initiating blood clots, they also contain growth factors. So the hope is that platelet injections will stimulate healing without the damaging effects of shock-wave therapy. But it will be some years before that approach is proven -- or not.\n\nMeanwhile, foot specialists and their patients are left with a smattering of low-tech treatments that they say all plantar fasciitis patients should try, whether or not they eventually go on to shock-wave therapy.\n\nThese methods include:\n\n-- Stretching the foot several times a day\n\n-- Icing the bottom of the foot, sometimes using ice to massage the heel area\n\n-- Using cups made of gel in shoes to cushion the heel (and many orthopedic surgeons say expensive custom-made orthotics are not necessary)\n\n-- Wearing a night splint, a simple brace that holds the foot in a flexed position to keep the plantar fascia stretched during sleep\n\n-- Physical therapy, though some studies indicate that some PT practices such as ultrasound and whirlpool are not helpful\n\n-- Use of NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen\n\n-- Corticosteroid injections into the heel, though this is controversial and should not be used repeatedly\n\n-- Wearing a ""walking cast""\n\n-- Weight loss\n\n-- Taping the foot during exercise\n\n-- Backing off activities like running until the pain goes away, and then reinitiating them gradually\n\nAbout 90 percent of sufferers will get better with time. Duggal says he advises patients to try a combination of these measures for at least a year.\n\nKaren Firestone, a 54-year-old Boston businesswoman and avid runner, says that techniques like stretching, icing and taping were effective for her. She started having plantar fascia pain last summer, and on Duggal\'s advice has been diligent about doing everything she can to heal the problem.\n\n""The stretching, the icing, the taping -- I do all these little pieces of help for my body, and it responds,"" Firestone says. ""So I think people should take that message and go with it.""\n\nAfter a few months, she\'s back to running -- but shorter distances. And she stops whenever her heel pain acts up.']",A solid piece about which we have only a few reservations.  We have no doubt that most listeners and readers were smarter after hearing/reading this piece. ,"This story is about the use of shockwaves to treat a condition called plantar fasciitis that causes heel pain. The story drives home the point that there are conflicting studies and opinions as to the effectiveness of this treatment, but we wish it had gone further to explore the quality of the underlying data. The story presents opposing expert views but gives us no way to gauge which is supported by the evidence. 
On the whole, though, the story earns high marks for providing detailed cost information, engaging in an extensive discussion of alternative treatments, and generally avoiding hype.

In the study, only 21 percent of patients experienced a prolonged survival. Much more follow-up research is needed to better assess and hopefully improve the treatment\'s effectiveness, the researchers say.\n\n""We have to be careful,"" says Annick Desjardins, a Duke neuro-oncologist who helped conduct the study. ""But we have long-term survivors. We are seeing something we don\'t normally see with patients with glioblastoma.""\n\nDr. David Reardon, clinical director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says the Duke group\'s results may represent ""a good, solid, important step forward"" for patients with no alternatives.\n\n""Unfortunately, for most patients this is not going to be the answer yet,"" says Reardon, who used to work at Duke but wasn\'t involved in the new research. ""My fear is that every patient and family dealing with the devastating disease of glioblastoma is going to think the poliovirus is the cure. Unfortunately, the patients who are benefiting do reflect a relatively small percentage of the population.""\n\nThe Duke results were published online Tuesday by the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with their presentation at the 22nd International Conference on Brain Tumor Research in Norway.\n\nGlioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults. It\'s the cancer that killed former Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden\'s son Beau. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is fighting glioblastoma.\n\nThe Duke researchers decided to try to use a genetically modified version of the poliovirus, which can cause a devastating form of paralysis, because of the virus\'s ability to infect nervous system cells.\n\nThe scientists removed one of the virus\'s genes to prevent it from causing polio and replaced that gene with one from a harmless virus known as a rhinovirus, which ordinarily causes the common cold.\n\nThe engineered virus was then infused directly into tumors in patients\' brains with a tube inserted through a hole in the skull. The modified virus retains the ability to infect and kill brain tumor cells, and also appears to trigger the patient\'s own immune system cells to attack the tumors, the researchers say.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2017, the researchers treated 61 patients, trying various doses of the modified virus to determine which was safest and most effective.\n\nThere are substantial risks. The treatment can cause a dangerous swelling in the brain that can lead to seizures and other complications, the researchers found. One patient suffered a life-threatening blood clot in the brain that required surgery.\n\nBut overall, the median length of survival was 12.5 months for patients treated with poliovirus, compared with 11.3 months for a similar group of patients treated in the past, the researchers report. And starting at two years after treatment, the two groups\' survival rate began to diverge, the researchers reported.\n\nAfter 24 months, 21 percent of the patients treated with the virus had survived compared with 14 percent of the historical comparison group. After three years, 21 percent of the poliovirus treated patients survived, compared with 4 percent of the other group, according to the researchers.\n\nTwo patients have survived more than six years, Bigner says. One has survived more than five years.\n\n""You just don\'t see this percentage of long-term survivors with this disease,"" Bigner says. ""Those that have survived more than two years are in remission, and we expect them to continue to be long-term survivors.""\n\nSome other researchers praised the results.\n\n""We\'re extraordinarily encouraged by what we see with this data,"" says Mitchel Berger, chairman of neurosurgery at the University of California, San Francisco and director of its center for brain tumors. ""It\'s phenomenal.""\n\nBut some cancer doctors caution that comparing the outcomes for patients receiving the virus treatment to what would have happened to similar patients in the past could produce misleading conclusions.\n\nThe Duke researchers have started a follow-up study combining the treatment with a chemotherapy drug to try to improve the results. They also plan to combine the treatment with other drugs, including some called checkpoint inhibitors, to harness the immune system to fight cancer.\n\nIn addition, the researchers are planning to try the approach on children with brain cancer, as well as other types of cancer, including melanoma and breast cancer. ""We believe we are going to be able to increase the results even more significantly,"" Bigner says.']",The only thing the story lacked was disclosing that seven of the researchers on the study reported financial interests in the company that holds the license for the treatment.,"This is one of two stories we reviewed about an early-phase trial of the use of a modified poliovirus for glioblastoma, a fatal brain cancer. The other review covers an NBC News story. Results of the study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The story and the headline did an exceptional job of maintaining a cautious tone with phrasing, such as saying the approach “seems to have extended survival in a small group of patients.” It also did a good job of covering harms and describing the scope of the benefit. A couple of quibbles: The story could have mentioned the financial interests of the research team, and provided some context on how this isn’t a brand-new idea–it’s been in the spotlight of news coverage for a few years now.

In a common form of cataracts, proteins in the lens change over time, developing chromophores — molecular add-ons that absorb color in the blue part of the spectrum. Chromophores reduce the amount of light reaching the retina (and give the lens a yellow-brown appearance), but they also disrupt the structure of the lens proteins, causing light to scatter.\n\nCataracts can be treated by lens-replacement surgery, but the procedure is invasive and costly, requiring special equipment and skilled eye surgeons. To make cataract treatment available to more people around the world, a less-invasive, less-expensive technique is needed.\n\nLine Kessel, an ophthalmologist at Glostrup Hospital of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and colleagues have come up with what they say is a promising alternative to replacement surgery. In their approach, described in the open-access journal PLoS ONE, they “bleach” the lens with a laser.\n\nUltraviolet light can alter chromophores so they no longer absorb color, but UV light can damage the retina. So the researchers use infrared light, delivered by an extremely fast-pulse laser. The pulses are so fast, Dr. Kessel said, that two photons hit a target molecule simultaneously, with the same effect as if UV light was used.\n\nThe laser treatment reduces the light absorption and also helps restore the lens proteins to their proper structure. Much more research and development work remains, Dr. Kessel said, but the goal is a relatively simple procedure that would last half an hour at most and use largely automated equipment in mobile clinics.']","Despite the headline’s claim that this laser ""treatment"" may work for cataracts, the story never explained that this was an experiment on just 9 human organ donor lenses and not an actual clinical treatment. ","It’s not a ""treatment"" until it helps a living human being.  Until then, it’s an experiment. 
In a story that afforded the topic only 268 words, rather than using 23 of them to say that ""the goal is a relatively simple procedure that would last half an hour at most and use largely automated equipment in mobile clinics""  – perhaps a cautious independent perspective would have helped remind people that this research wasn’t done on people – only on donor lenses.

During the same period, no blood clots were reported among patients who were far enough along in testing to be evaluated in the 101-patient study.\n\nAbsorb, like traditional metal stents, is meant to prop open heart arteries that have been cleared of plaque. But unlike the millions of metal stents that are implanted in patients each year, it does not remain fixed in the arteries for life.\n\n“The trial’s results would be equivalent to an excellent metallic stent - that type of performance,” said Dr. Patrick Serruys, a cardiologist from Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, who led the study.\n\nThe stent was approved in Europe in January, but will not be widely available there until late next year. It was cleared by European regulators even though large so-called pivotal trials have not yet been conducted on the product.\n\nAbbott plans to begin a 500-patient pivotal trial in Europe later this year and to conduct a 2,000-patient trial in the United States by the end of 2011. It hopes to seek U.S. approval for the product in 2015, several years before any competitor.\n\nSerruys said current stents are essentially “cages” that hamper the flexibility of arteries and make them more prone to reclogging as they develop scar tissue and plaque builds up.\n\nHe said Absorb and stents like it will likely be the next generation of stents and ultimately improve outcomes for patients.\n\nHe said bioresorbable materials have great potential for other uses, particularly for stents to repair the pulmonary arteries and aortas of babies.\n\n“The baby will grow and the biodegradable material will disappear,” he said. “That would be one compassionate use of it, a very serious application.

This appears to be due to increased use of technology to detect thyroid nodules that may not otherwise been found previously. Most thyroid cancers can be treated successfully, but advanced cases can be difficult to treat, especially if they do not respond to radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. New treatments called ‘immunotherapies’ are being explored. They target a certain protein that has the ability to shut down T cells – a part of white blood cells that help the body fight infection and disease naturally. In blocking this activity, these new immunotherapy drugs help T cells get back to work in protecting the body.\n\nJanice M. Mehnert, MD, director of the Phase I and Developmental Therapeutics Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, is the lead author of research highlighting the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and its effect on advanced thyroid cancer. The work is being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting which begins tomorrow in Chicago. Dr. Mehnert, who is also a medical oncologist in the Melanoma and Soft Tissue Oncology Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute, shares more about the research:\n\nQ: How was the study structured?A: At the time our abstract was submitted, 22 patients with a diagnosis of advanced or metastatic papillary or follicular thyroid cancer who failed prior standard therapy were accrued from multiple international sites. Participants received 10 mg of pembrolizumab every two weeks for up to 24 months or until confirmed progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety, tolerability and response were assessed every eight weeks for the first six months and every 12 weeks thereafter.\n\nQ: What did you find?A: At the time we reported our results, six of the 22 patients remained on treatment. Of those who completed therapy, two patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of 9.1 percent, and there was a stable disease rate of 54.5 percent. The six-month overall survival rate was 100 percent and the six month progression free survival rate was 58.7 percent. Updated results will be announced at the annual meeting. There were no treatment-related deaths or therapy discontinuations due to drug-related adverse effects. Overall, pembrolizumab shows promising antitumor activity in advanced cases of follicular or papillary thyroid cancer which progressed on standard treatment. The clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in advanced thyroid cancer will be further studied in a follow-up phase II clinical trial that is now ongoing to try to discover biomarkers which predict response to treatment with pembrolizumab.\n\nQ: How are immunotherapy drugs changing the landscape of cancer treatment?A: Although many patients treated do not respond, when immunotherapy does induce responses in patients with advanced cancers, these responses may be very long lasting in terms of disease control. As well, at least when used as single agents, these agents tend to confer side effects that patients find much more tolerable than those associated with chemotherapy. It’s an exciting time in early phase drug development when we are observing these results in so many different types of cancer. Additional information is available at http://abstract.asco.org/176/AbstView_176_165870.html.']",Is a news release warranted when just two of six patients completing a safety trial show a “partial response?”,"This release summarizes the preliminary results of an early Phase 1 safety trial using the drug pembrolizumab (marketed as Keytruda) in 22 patients with thyroid cancer that had not responded to chemotherapy. The study was presented at the large American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting as an abstract and has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. While almost ignoring the safety aspect — the main purpose of a Phase 1 study — the abstract and release tout a 9.1 percent “overall response rate” among the six patients that completed the trial. Of the six completing the trial, two had a partial response. We think these results are too preliminary and based on too small of a group to warrant a news release calling Keytruda “promising” for advanced thyroid cancer. The release also omitted mention of the trial funders and the financial ties that exist between the investigators and the drug manufacturer.

But we think it’s far too soon to be touting a group of heart hormones as holding “the key to an effective weight loss treatment” merely because they increase brown fat levels in a single study conducted in mice. Although the story did introduce some caveats, they came too late to counterbalance the overoptimistic tone of the coverage.

Both drugs cause tumors to shrink and prolong survival for patients with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body, but neither is a cure.\n\n""This is an unprecedented time of clinical options -- it is truly practice-changing,"" said Dr. Lynn Schuchter, who heads the Melanoma Center at the University of Pennsylvania and is not involved with the research.\n\nMayoClinic: Find out more about melanoma\n\nOne study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology\'s (ASCO) conference on Sunday focused on the experimental drug vemurafenib. About half of all melanoma patients have a mutated BRAF gene. This mutation tells the cell to continue to grow.\n\n""It\'s like the on-switch is stuck,"" said Dr. Paul Chapman, from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center in New York and lead author of the study. Vemurafenib blocks the mutated gene, which kills the cancer cell and shrinks tumors.\n\nResearchers compared this new drug, which comes in pill form, to the only FDA-approved chemotherapy drug for melanoma, dacarbazine: It has been used to treat melanoma patients since 1975, but is only effective in about 10% of patients.\n\nNearly 90% benefited from this new targeted drug, Schuchter said.\n\nIn a large, phase 3 study involving 675 people worldwide, patients on vemurafenib did much better than those on chemotherapy. Forty-eight percent of patients on vemurafenib had substantial tumor shrinkage that lasted for more than a month, compared to 5.5% of patients in the chemotherapy group.\n\nThose taking vemurafenib had a 63% reduced risk of death compared to those on chemo. Patients on vemurafenib saw the drug work within 72 hours and 84% of the patients were still alive after six months, compared with 64% of patients getting dacarbazine.\n\n""These are truly striking results"" ASCO president Dr. George Sledge said.\n\nPatient advocates like Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, are thrilled because ""the incidence of melanoma is going up all over the world and the treatment landscape has been terrible.""\n\nDrugs that treat breast cancer found to prevent it, too\n\nSledge and other cancer experts are confident that based on these study results, vemurafenib will almost certainly will get FDA approval this year.\n\nA second study showed that the recently approved drug Ipilimumab, sold under the name Yervoy, also extends survival for melanoma patients with advanced disease.\n\nIt doesn\'t target a specific part of the cell. Instead, it stimulates the patient\'s immune system to allow it to better fight the cancer. Patients with and without the BRAF mutation were eligible to participate.\n\nAmong 502 patients enrolled in this clinical trial, half were given Yervoy plus dacarbazine and the other half were given a placebo and chemotherapy.\n\n""Twenty-one percent of (the Yervoy) population was alive after three years,"" lead study author Dr. Jedd Wolchok said, compared to 12% who got the placebo and chemo. Wolchok, also an oncologist from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said patients taking Yervoy saw the drug work for them for 19 months, compared to only eight months in patients in the chemo group.\n\nSchuchter says melanoma patients are celebrating this moment because there are now two good treatment options for patients, when there really were none before.\n\n""I\'ve been doing this for 25 years, and we\'ve not had drugs that extended survival. That is what is so remarkable here,"" Schuchter said.\n\nWhile patients taking vemurafenib do very well, Schuchter said the drug stops working after about nine or 10 months. But in many cases that are nine or 10 months they otherwise would not have had.\n\nYervoy takes a while to work, and some patients may not have that time, study author Chapman said. He also points out that both drugs do have side effects so patients have to be monitored.\n\nDoctors and researchers will now explore how to best use these drugs -- give one before the other, or simultaneously.\n\nWolchok says manufacturers of both drugs (Genentech\'s vemurafenib and Bristol-Myers Squibb\'s Yervoy), which also funded these studies, have agreed to work with researchers to study how these drugs are tolerated by patients when taken together, giving doctors even more possible treatment options. This is very unusual in the world of drug development, he said.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in young adults today. More than 68,000 people were diagnosed with melanoma last year and about 8,700 died.\n\nNot all melanomas can be prevented, but limiting exposure to strong sunlight and other sources of UV light like tanning beds can significantly reduce the risk of getting this very deadly cancer.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The difference between a 4-star story and a 5-star score may be bigger than what first glance offers. </span>","More broadly, the story contained none of the restrained context provided by the Times.   Read and compare.

Filling Cavities Without The Drill\n\ntoggle caption Gretchen Cuda for NPR\n\nIt\'s just past 8 a.m., and Kimberly Baker is reclining in the dental chair at Case Western Reserve University\'s School of Dental Medicine in Cleveland.\n\nBaker has three cavities. This morning, she\'ll be getting two of them drilled the old-fashioned way. But the third is a decay that is not so advanced, and Dr. Jin-Ho Phark, her dentist, is going to use a treatment he\'s testing that involves no drilling -- ""which is nice because many patients don\'t like the sound of the drill, and the feeling or the pain that might be associated with it,"" Phark says.\n\nThat cringe-worthy sound may be on the way out. A new procedure used by Phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or Novocain.\n\nThe treatment, called Icon, is one of several new cavity treatments that avoid drilling. Icon was developed in Germany and has been available in the U.S. for just over a year. It\'s intended for patients whose decay has not gone beyond the tooth enamel.\n\nTo Drill Or Not To Drill\n\nPhark says that when decay is caught very early or very late, dentists have a clear course of action: Early problems can often be reversed with better brushing, fluoride or calcium-containing toothpastes -- and late-stage cavities need to be filled. But at the intermediate stages, dentists don\'t have many options.\n\n""In many of those cases we decide, \'OK, this lesion is too small to be treated with a filling.\' So, we are actually waiting until the lesion grows bigger and bigger and becomes deep enough and worthy to be drilled out and be filled,"" Phark says.\n\nGerman researcher Sebastian Paris is a dentist and one of the drill-less cavity treatment\'s developers.\n\n""We aim to treat these intermediate lesions -- not the very early ones, but the intermediate ones -- where usually, as a dentist, you are not sure whether you should make a filling or not,"" Paris says.\n\nHow It Works\n\nWhen tooth decay begins, minerals, like calcium, are leached out of the tooth enamel, leaving behind sponge-like pores in the enamel. If the decay process is allowed to continue, the pores grow and form a hole, known as a cavity.\n\nThe new treatment uses a coating of mild acid that is applied to the decay to open up a route to the pores and clear out decayed enamel. Then the open pores are filled with a clear resin.\n\ntoggle caption Gretchen Cuda for NPR\n\nParis says the key to getting the treatment to work was finding a filling material that wasn\'t thick and goopy so the porous enamel would immediately suck it up like a sponge.\n\n""When you take a sugar cube and you put it into your coffee, you will see that it is soaked up with the coffee,"" Paris says. ""But if you put your sugar cube into honey, you can imagine that it will take ages to soak into the sugar cube.""\n\nCheaper, Lighter Alternatives To The Drill\n\nAvoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth. However, some dentists argue that any time before a cavity actually forms, tooth decay can be stopped -- and even reversed -- by the patients themselves, using, for example, fluoride toothpaste.\n\n""An alternative could simply be brushing better in a certain location and not drinking Coca-Cola all day long,"" says Mark Wolff, a professor of dentistry at New York University who specializes in cariology, or the study of tooth decay.\n\nWolff says that while the no-drill approach to treating this type of tooth decay has promise, fluoride treatments and other patient-applied methods are still more inexpensive, less invasive and have a much longer track record of success.\n\n""Might this be a good application to help that person recover or prevent this decay from advancing? Absolutely. I think the jury is still out on the product a little bit. Hopefully it works.

The headline proclaims that the featured dental sealant means “Filling Cavities Without the Drill.” But the product is not actually approved to fill cavities, as the manufacturer’s web site puts it, the sealant “cannot be used in cases of advanced decay” and it “is not the same as a traditional filling.” The body of the story points out that the product is used on pits that are too small to be filled, in hopes of preventing further development, but readers are likely to be misled by the headline and lead paragraphs.
The story also calls the product new, but in its application for FDA approval the manufacturer said the sealant is “substantially equivalent” to other sealants that have been available for more than a decade.

This might include reducing blood pressure and inflammation, he added.\n\nPrevious research linked dementia risk with the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in blood plasma, which reflects how much people had eaten in the past few days. But in the current work, researchers could estimate the amount of omega-3s that participants had consumed in the past several months by looking at how much had built up in their red blood cells.\n\n""This represents their average intake of fatty acids, not just a snapshot,"" Tan said.\n\nThe study, published in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Neurology, did not prove that omega-3 fatty acids prevent mental decline, merely that there may be an association between consumption of fatty acids and brain health.\n\nFor the study, researchers measured the red blood cell level of fatty acids in 1,575 dementia-free people whose average age was 67. About three months later, participants underwent mental-functioning tests and MRI scans that examined brain size and blood supply in the brain.\n\nThe participants were in the Framingham Offspring Study, which is predominately white. Whether the association would apply to other ethnic and racial groups needs to be explored, the authors said.\n\nThe researchers found that those with the lowest levels of omega-3s had worse scores on tests of visual memory, attention and abstract thinking than people who ranked in the top 75 percent for fatty-acid levels.\n\nAdults in the bottom 25 percent also tended to have smaller brain volume overall. The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels.\n\nBrain scans also showed signs of less blood supply in the brains of people with the lowest omega-3 levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said.\n\nThe researchers took into account various health and lifestyle factors, including age, education and body mass index, to explore whether other differences among the people with low levels of omega-3s could help explain their more rapid brain aging.\n\nBut after controlling for those risk factors, ""the difference [in brain aging] is still there so we conclude that omega-3 fatty acids likely explain them,"" Tan said.\n\nTan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. Another possibility is that the slight mental decline that the people in the older brain group were experiencing caused them to eat less healthy omega-3-rich foods, instead of vice versa.\n\n""This is a strengthening of the argument that people with less [omega-3 fatty acids] have higher risk of dementia,"" said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\nBut questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, fish is ""a good prescription for other things and we have a hint it might be helpful for the brain,"" Scarmeas said.\n\nThat the current study reported a difference in brain health between people with omega-3 fatty-acid levels in the bottom 25 percent and top 75 percent suggests that there is a threshold level of consumption to attain brain gains.\n\nA previous study in which participants filled out food surveys found decreased risk of vascular brain problems among those who ate at least three servings of fish a week.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about brain health at the Alzheimer\'s Association.']",This was the best of three stories we reviewed about a study of omega-3 fatty acids and the aging brain. The difference: a clear and detailed description of the limitations of observational research.,"This story made the key point that CNN and the Washington Post failed to communicate in their competing coverage: “This study … did not prove that omega-3 fatty acids prevent mental decline, merely that there may be an association between consumption of fatty acids and brain health.”

Born with scoliosis, a curvature of the spine, she was later in a car accident, then a white-water rafting accident that made her back problems worse.\n\n“I had so much pain that I would wake up and reach my arm out to touch my alarm … and something would just snap,” the 26-year-old who now lives in Aruba said.\n\nWhen she was a teen, doctors recommended surgery to straighten her spine. Both her aunt and grandmother also were diagnosed with scoliosis. Her aunt opted for the back surgery, which helped alleviate pain but also left her with very limited movement in her spine.\n\nThen, a friend suggested Brathen try yoga. She decided to try a few classes before undergoing the knife.\n\nMore than 22 million people practice yoga in the United States, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. Many of them practice to improve flexibility and find pain relief, according to the Yoga Journal.\n\nBut as Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News chief health and medical editor, noted, it’s difficult to pin down whether yoga is effective at easing symptoms of those who have back pain.\n\n“There are many types of yoga and so many different causes of back pain,” he said.\n\nDespite the lack of conclusive research, Besser said, there is some recent evidence to suggest that people with chronic low-back pain who do a carefully adapted set of yoga poses may experience less pain and improve their ability to walk and move.\n\nBen Kane\n\nIn one randomized controlled trial published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, back pain patients who learned yoga had better back function and were better able to manage their pain. Another study in the same journal showed that yoga improved disability from chronic back pain more than exercise or self-care instructions.\n\nThere is also a close relationship between yoga and stress, so taking yoga might reduce stress and, in turn, provide some relief to someone with a tense, achy back, noted Dr. Amit Sood, professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nBut as good as yoga may be for soothing stress and a sore back, Sood recommended getting medical clearance first and taking it slow and easy to start.\n\nThat’s exactly what Brathen did.\n\nShe started with gentle, restorative classes that focused on improving the core strength of her middle muscles. Little by little she noticed the pain was less intense and less frequent. She said it took years to move from a slow, meditative practice to more rigorous poses.\n\nToday, she is not only nearly pain free, she is able to do advanced moves like handstands and acrobatic arm balances.\n\nBrathen said she is so grateful for her yoga practice, she became an instructor. Now she travels the world teaching yoga and sharing her story. She started a social media challenge with the hashtag #yogaeverydamnday that has 1.6 million fans on Instagram.\n\nBut she said yoga has done more for her than just heal her lower back.\n\n“Yoga helps with a feeling of well-being on so many levels,” she said. “The world could benefit more from people with flexible hearts than flexible bodies.”\n\nBen Kane\n\nTweet Chat on the health benefits of yoga, today at 1PM, ET\n\nHas your mind, body and spirit been helped in some way by yoga? Join our tweet chat today on the health benefits of yoga at 1 p.m. ET and share your story. Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News chief health and medical editor, will moderate.\n\nJoining is easy. Here’s how.\n\nAdditional reporting by ABC News’ Liz Neporent.']",We think journalists should avoid leaning excessively on individual patient anecdotes that may not be representative. This story demonstrates why.,"This story begins with a young girl who finds relief from her crippling scoliosis-related back pain through yoga. Without warning or explanation, it morphs into a discussion of yoga for chronic low back pain in general. This shift is confusing and troubling, because while there is some evidence that yoga can be an effective approach for relief of chronic low back pain, there’s no such supporting evidence for yoga as an alternative to surgery for people with severe scoliosis. To suggest, based on one anecdote, that readers with severe scoliosis might look to yoga as an alternative to surgery is misleading and irresponsible.

Nearly a quarter of a million people worldwide have leprosy, which causes disfiguration of the skin and mucous membranes as well as progressive and incurable nerve damage. While drug therapy exists for leprosy, it must be taken for many months, has many side effects and often is given too late to reverse the permanent damage caused by the bacterial infection. A viable vaccine to prevent and/or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end.\n\nScientists at IDRI, along with national and international collaborators including the National Hansen\'s Disease Program and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, with financial support from American Leprosy Missions, have developed a promising leprosy vaccine candidate designed to help treat leprosy and prevent exposed individuals from developing disease and the resulting disabilities. Based on data generated in preclinical studies, the vaccine candidate, called LepVax, has progressed to Phase I clinical testing in the United States, the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers. The clinical trial is focused on safety, as well as evaluating the immune response to the vaccine.\n\n""While previous attempts have used vaccines primarily developed for other diseases, this is the first totally defined vaccine candidate developed specifically for leprosy, using the latest technologies and offering no less than those exposed to leprosy deserve,"" said Steven Reed, Ph.D., IDRI President, CEO & Founder. ""The leprosy vaccine program at IDRI has benefited greatly from what we\'ve learned in the development of tuberculosis vaccine candidates over the past two decades. Although the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy are related, leprosy vaccine development posed great challenges. This vaccine represents a unique accomplishment, requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology, and American Leprosy Missions has been there from the beginning."" IDRI scientists have also developed two vaccine candidates for tuberculosis, both in clinical stages of development.\n\n""We are thrilled that after 15 years and an investment of over $5.1 million, made possible by our faithful donors and partners, a leprosy-specific vaccine is beginning a Phase I clinical trial,"" says Bill Simmons, President and CEO of American Leprosy Missions. ""We believe this may be the most exciting breakthrough in leprosy treatment since multi-drug therapy, the current treatment for leprosy, was launched in the 1980s. We look forward to this vaccine improving the health outcomes of people diagnosed with leprosy. And, it may be that this vaccine can lead to interruption of the transmission of leprosy all together. What a tremendous legacy this would leave for millions of people worldwide.""\n\nThe vaccine was developed through significant efforts in screening and identifying M. leprae proteins that trigger an effective immune response. IDRI scientists then produced a fusion of four leprosy proteins, which is combined with IDRI\'s proprietary immune-stimulating adjuvant (GLA-SE). With recent developments in vaccine technology, IDRI scientists can now induce protective responses even after infection, meaning it could be possible to prevent disease development in people already infected with the leprosy bacterium.\n\n""This generation of a vaccine to prevent and possibly treat leprosy is the result of years of research. The development has been complicated by the fact that the organism that causes leprosy cannot be grown in culture in the laboratory,"" Reed explained. ""This is a unique example of a vaccine produced by totally synthetic methods.""\n\nReed added that, without the foresight and support of American Leprosy Missions, there would be no leprosy vaccine candidate. ""The vision and support of American Leprosy Missions has been tremendous as we\'ve worked with them throughout the years, moving from our work in developing a leprosy diagnostic to our current focus on a successful leprosy vaccine,"" he said. ""The progress we\'ve had to date would not have been possible without American Leprosy Missions\' financial support and guidance."" Early results from the Phase I study should be available in 2018, and the partners are currently exploring mechanisms to advance the vaccine through later-phase clinical trials should results from the Phase I study (clinical trial NCT03302897) support further evaluation.\n\nThe vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy, which will require detection, prevention and treatment. IDRI had developed technology to enable a rapid, affordable, point-of-care diagnostic test, which was funded by NIAID (grant numbers 1R43AI066613-01A1 and 2R44AI066613-02.)\n\nIn addition to IDRI and American Leprosy Missions, a variety of partners are taking part in efforts to eliminate leprosy, including Novartis and the Novartis Foundation. Reed, along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published ""Innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae"" in The Lancet Infectious Diseases , outlining what is needed to achieve this goal. Together with scientific, government and NGO partners, the Novartis Foundation develops and implements strategies to help interrupt leprosy transmission, while Novartis donates the treatment for leprosy free of charge.\n\nAbout IDRI: As a nonprofit global health organization, IDRI (Infectious Disease Research Institute) takes a comprehensive approach to combat infectious diseases, combining the high-quality science of a research organization with the product development capabilities of a biotech company to create new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. Founded in 1993, IDRI has 125 employees headquartered in Seattle with nearly 100 partners/collaborators around the world. For more information, visit www.idri.org.\n\nAbout American Leprosy Missions: American Leprosy Missions, based in Greenville, South Carolina, is the oldest and largest Christian organization in the United States dedicated to curing and caring for people affected by leprosy and related diseases. It funds projects and partners in countries across Africa, Asia and the Americas. During its more than 100-year history, American Leprosy Missions has provided holistic care to four million people around the world including medical treatment and training, Christian outreach, community development and vaccine research.

The release does not address cost, prematurely refers to the vaccine as “a breakthrough,” and does little to discuss potential harms — other than to note that phase I trials are focused on safety. The release also offers little information about the effectiveness of previous attempts to develop leprosy vaccines, which would have been valuable context.

The release would have been better if it dialed back on the sensational language and included the cost of this pricey drug.,"This news release from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) heralding the safety and efficacy of a combination drug therapy for children with hepatitis C does a good job in several areas. It explains the scope of benefits and harms, how the study was conducted, and how the therapy could improve treatment options for kids with this contagious disease. On the other hand, the news release overlooks discussion of the enormous cost of this therapy and of potential adverse effects that may emerge when the therapy is used in a large population. We also disagree with its use of the sensational words “cure” and “breakthrough.”
Editor’s note: This review contains an update under the benefits criteria that adds a caution about not equating reduced viral load with a cure.

Patients with large-vessel occlusions can then be routed to a Comprehensive Stroke Center with endovascular capabilities. In contrast, a standard physical examination achieved only 40 to 89 percent accuracy in identifying patients with large-vessel occlusion who could benefit from endovascular therapy.\n\nThe volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) device (Cerebrotech VisorTM, Cerebrotech Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) works by sending low-energy radio waves through the brain that change frequency when passing through fluids. Such waves are reflected back through the brain and then detected by the device. When a patient is having a severe stroke, the brain\'s fluids will change, producing an asymmetry in the radio waves detected by the VIPS device. The greater the asymmetry, the more severe the stroke.\n\nEndovascular therapy within 24 hours is the standard of care for emergent large-vessel occlusion, but the chance of achieving a good outcome decreases by approximately 20 percent for each hour that passes before treatment.\n\nThe researchers hope that the device will save valuable time -- especially important in stroke where time is brain -- when it is deployed with emergency medical personnel in the field. This is because the accuracy of the device simplifies the decision made by emergency personnel about where to take patients first, according to Raymond D. Turner, M.D., professor of neurosurgery and chief of the Neuroscience Integrated Center of Clinical Excellence at MUSC. Turner served as principal investigator for MUSC in the VIPS for the Non-Invasive Detection of Hemispheric Bioimpedance Asymmetry in Severe Brain Pathology (VITAL) study reported in the article.\n\n""Transfer between hospitals takes a lot of time,"" said Turner. ""If we can give the information to emergency personnel out in the field that this is a large-vessel occlusion, that should change their thought process in triage as to which hospital they go to.""\n\nIn the study, the VIPS device was deployed with emergency medical personnel in regions served by five Comprehensive Stroke Centers equipped with the endovascular capabilities to treat large-vessel occlusions that underlie severe stroke. Their goal was to use the device to accurately identify severe stroke and then compare the results to established physical examination methods practiced by emergency personnel such as the Prehospital Acute Stroke Severity Scale.\n\nBoth healthy participants and patients with suspected stroke were evaluated by emergency personnel using the VIPS device. Three readings were taken and averaged -- a process that takes about 30 seconds. Patients were also later evaluated by neurologists who provided definitive diagnoses using neuroimaging.\n\nCompared to the neurologists\' diagnoses, the device displayed 92 percent specificity -- the ability to detect the difference between patients with severe stroke and those with other conditions such as mild stroke or healthy participants with no brain pathology. This places the VIPS device above standard physical examination tools used by emergency personnel that display specificity scores between 40 and 89 percent.\n\nThe VIPS device is made by Cerebrotech Medical Systems, which paid consultants to analyze the neuroimaging data independently. The neuroimaging data was needed to teach the VIPS device which radio waves were indicative of stroke. Yet the consultants did not have access to the VIPS radio wave data during their review of the images, thereby eliminating the potential of the consultants to choose data that might artificially inflate the device\'s accuracy. It is also not clear how the device would work for patients with cranial implants, as metal interferes with the device\'s operating radio frequencies.\n\nThe device\'s success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis.\n\nIn their next steps, the researchers are undertaking the VITAL 2.0 study to determine if the VIPS device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment.\n\nTurner likens the use of the VIPS device in detecting severe stroke to the use of electrocardiography (ECG) to definitively detect acute myocardial infarction. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces. ""This could potentially be something like a defibrillator,"" said Turner. ""You can find out if a patient is having a stroke, just like you can put a defibrillator on a patient to see if they\'re having a heart attack.""\n\nThis study was funded by Cerebrotech Medical Systems.\n\nAbout MUSC Founded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South. Today, MUSC continues the tradition of excellence in education, research, and patient care. MUSC educates and trains more than 3,000 students and residents, and has nearly 13,000 employees, including approximately 1,500 faculty members. As the largest non-federal employer in Charleston, the university and its affiliates have collective annual budgets in excess of $2.2 billion. MUSC operates a 750-bed medical center, which includes a nationally recognized Children\'s Hospital, the Ashley River Tower (cardiovascular, digestive disease, and surgical oncology), Hollings Cancer Center (a National Cancer Institute designated center) Level I Trauma Center, and Institute of Psychiatry.

The release describes a published study on the VIPS diagnostic tool showing that it can accurately detect large-vessel occlusion (a blockage or closing of a blood vessel) in patients with suspected stroke yet it misses some of the key features you’d expect with a news release talking about a new diagnostic tool, especially its cost, and its accuracy measured against other methods, such as a mobile CT scan, to differentiate strokes.

Further, that incidence—3 percent—was so low that researchers suggested that “watchful waiting” may be a viable alternative to such diagnostic tests. Missing from this story is any reflection on cost; other researchers have found that the CT scan is associated with much higher health care spending rates. We also thought the story could have done without a misleading closing anecdote that badly undercuts the main message of the story.

It’s a weird but handy trick for someone who swallows 25 pills a day, most of them purchases off the Internet.\n\nBurke credits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California’s Silicon Valley, where he’s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees.\n\nHe used to get his edge from Adderall, but after moving from New Jersey to San Francisco, he says, he couldn’t find a doctor who would write him a prescription. Driven to the Internet, he discovered a world of cognition-enhancing drugs known as nootropics — some prescription, some over-the-counter, others available on a worldwide gray market of private sellers — said to improve memory, attention, creativity and motivation.\n\n“It’s not like every tech worker in Silicon Valley is taking nootropics to get ahead,” Burke acknowledges. “It’s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that.”\n\nThe word “nootropic” was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for “mind” and “bending.” Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. Even microdosing of LSD is increasingly viewed as a means to greater productivity.\n\nBut when aficionados talk about nootropics, they usually refer to substances that have supposedly few side effects and low toxicity. Most often they mean piracetam, which Giurgea first synthesized in 1964 and which is approved for therapeutic use in dozens of countries for use in adults and the elderly. Not so in the United States, however, where officially it can be sold only for research purposes.\n\nPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities. But it’s only one of many formulations in the racetam drug family. Newer ones include aniracetam, phenylpiracetam and oxiracetam. All are available online, where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts.\n\nUsing ‘stacks’\n\nA number of companies now market nootropic “stacks,” or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\n\nBecause they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims, they avoid close government scrutiny.\n\nWhen Burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago, it arrived in baggies filled with white powder. “It was as if I was buying coke off the street,” he recalls. These days, he buys his stack from Nootroo, a San Francisco company.\n\nBut self-experimenters such as Burke often don’t restrict themselves to medication alone. Dedicated brain hackers, as they call themselves, are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind. Their methods include meditation, cold-water plunges, periodic fasting and high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets.\n\n“Who doesn’t want to maximize their cognitive ability? Who doesn’t want to maximize their muscle mass?” asks Murali Doraiswamy, who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at Duke University Health System and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the Food and Drug Administration. He attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge-based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else.\n\nBut while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs — of any type — improve thinking or productivity over the long run. “There’s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,” notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, “it’s a zero-sum game. That’s because when you up one circuit in the brain, you’re probably impairing another system.”\n\nShort-term benefits?\n\nEarly studies attributed a lot of short-term benefits to nootropics — so much so that in 1983, Russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight.\n\nA 1999 study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories, typically shows severe shrinkage with Alzheimer’s. The idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting.\n\nAlthough piracetam has a history of “relatively few side effects,” it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. “We don’t use it at all and never have.”\n\nAs for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. “Piracetam has been studied for decades,” says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But “some of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they’re selling. Please don’t take it, people!”\n\nFor Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough.\n\nBurke, who begins each morning with a Bulletproof coffee — a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil — has created a San Francisco meetup group called Peak Performance “to teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a--better every day.”\n\nLast spring, 100 people showed up at a Peak Performance event where psychedelic psychologist James Fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition-enhancing effects of LSD — which he listed as less anxiety, better focus, improved sleep, greater creativity — was all in the dosage. He recommended a tenth of a “party dose” — enough to give you “the glow” and enhance your cognitive powers without “the trip.”\n\nBurke says he definitely got the glow. “The first time I took it, I was working on a business plan. I had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head, and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head. I was able to place each contingency on a branch, retract and go back to the trunk, and in this visual way I was able to juggle more information.”\n\nThe effects of fasting\n\nNot all brain hacking involves taking a pill, though.\n\nNootrobox, a San Francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body.\n\n“We stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being,” says Manuel Lam, an internal medicine physician who advises Nootrobox on clinical issues. He and members of the company’s executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms — not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real-time effect of the foods they eat.\n\n“Fasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel,” Lam enthuses. “It’s like being strapped to a solar panel. The sun is always shining on you.”\n\nNootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every Tuesday, then meet for breakfast on Wednesday at a local diner. Founded by two Stanford University computer graduates, the company has initiated an international fasting group on Facebook; at last count, there were 3,500 members.\n\nResearch on animals has shown that intermittent fasting — limiting caloric intake at least two days a week — can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque, a protein prevalent in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice.\n\nMark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence — so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting.\n\n“There’s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases,” he says.\n\nFasting has been deployed since the ancient Greeks to fast-track learning. As Plato is said to have stated, “I fast for greater physical and mental efficiency.” The philosopher Pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast 40 days before attending his lectures.\n\nFar easier to take a pill.\n\nLooking for an edge\n\nVinh Ngo, a San Francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy, has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base. His office is located in the heart of the city’s tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young, male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement.\n\nNgo has experimented with piracetam himself (“The first time I tried it, I thought, ‘Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.’ I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful”) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (“You have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It’s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain”).\n\nBut he has also seen patients whose propensity for self-experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand. One chief executive he treated, Ngo said, developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol, because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working. Unfortunately, the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration, headaches, vision and cardiac problems, muscle contractions and, in extreme cases, seizures.\n\n“There is that culture here [in Silicon Valley] that relies on being smarter than your own self,” Ngo says. “People want to find an edge over their competitor — that’s how they got their position in the first place. I’m trying to give them a little more wiggle room — but in a safe way.”\n\nHe says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests.\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach. “I don’t have a rubber stamp for everyone, and not everyone is a candidate” for cognitive enhancement, says Ngo, who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics.\n\nIf, for example, someone decides to go on medication — be it Adderall, albuterol or piracetam — the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems.\n\n“I want to empower them,” Ngo says, but “there’s a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy.”\n\nRead more\n\nBrainhacking: The frontier in mental illness treatment\n\nSmart drugs are here.

The results were published Monday by JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nThe study volunteers were all members of the Seventh Day Adventist church, which strongly encourages a vegetarian diet. (The church also urges followers to exercise regularly and refrain from smoking, drinking or using mind-altering substances.)\n\nAs a result, the researchers didn’t just compare vegetarians to non-vegetarians. They were also able to assess the relative merits of different types of vegetarian diets. Here’s how they stacked up:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy far, the lowest incidence of colorectal cancers was seen in pesco-vegetarians, people who eat fish at least once a month but eschew all other types of meat. Compared to omnivores, pesco-vegetarians were 43% less likely to be diagnosed with these cancers during the course of the study.\n\nLacto-ovo vegetarians (who eat eggs and dairy foods but not fish or other meats) came in second, with an 18% reduced incidence of colorectal cancer. They were followed closely by vegans (who don’t eat eggs, dairy products or any kind of meat), who were 16% less likely to get a colorectal cancer diagnosis.\n\nEven semi-vegetarians (who ate meat at least once per month but no more than once per week) were 8% less likely to get colorectal cancer during the study period than never-vegetarians, the researchers found.\n\nAll of these risk-reduction calculations were adjusted to account for age, gender, race, education level, daily calorie intake, exercise habits, smoking and drinking behavior, family history of colorectal cancer, and other medical conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers also crunched the numbers separately for colon cancer and rectal cancer. In this analysis, being a vegetarian (of any type) reduced the risk of colon cancer more than rectal cancer.\n\nPrevious studies have found that eating red meat – especially processed meat – is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and eating fiber is known to reduce the risk. So it’s not exactly surprising that vegetarians fared better than meat-eaters in this study.\n\nBut some of the details remain mysterious. For instance, the vegetarians in this study ate fewer foods with refined grains, added fats and sugar than their non-vegetarian counterparts. The study authors even said it will take more research to determine whether the pesco-vegetarians were better off because they ate fish.\n\nFor more medical news, follow me on Twitter @LATkarenkaplan and “like” Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.']","This story notes that vegetarians had a 22% lower risk of colorectal cancer compared with non-vegetarians. But that 22% difference translates to only 1.4 fewer cases for every 10,000 people in the study. We think it’s helpful for readers to know that.","The story summarizes a recent paper in JAMA Internal Medicine that reports a vegetarian diet is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. The story goes into some detail on the decreased risk for various types of vegetarian diets, and discusses some of the uncertainty regarding what may be responsible for the correlation between diet and cancer risk. However, the story never gives readers an accurate breakdown of the primary limitations of the study, and the statistics used in the story will give readers an inflated sense of the benefits. Not only is the reduction in cancer risk very small in absolute terms, but many of the results mentioned were not statistically significant. While the traditional definition of statistical significance has some problems, as we’ve discussed recently on the blog, we’d still expect stories to alert readers when findings do not achieve this benchmark.

SUGGESTIONS FOR STICKING TO ANY WEIGHT-LOSS PLAN SUGGESTIONS FOR STICKING TO ANY WEIGHT-LOSS PLAN Set weight-loss goals. An initial goal of 5% to 10% is recommended by health experts because that amount is associated with improvements in medical conditions, such as diabetes, and most people can achieve it. After this is achieved, another goal can be set. Aim for a reasonable weight loss of one to two pounds a week. Keep track of all foods and beverages you consume. Studies show dieters who keep a record of their intake lose twice as much weight as those who don\'t. Track weekly physical activity, including type, duration and frequency.

Here\'s what a new two-year study has found In the battle between a low-carb diet and a low-calorie, reduced-fat plan, the best weight-loss plan is — either one. A large study, released Monday, shows both diets produce similar weight loss and improvements in many health measures. \'NEW ATKINS\': Digesting the facts on the low-carb diet LOW-CALORIE: Easy recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks DIET SELECTOR: Which plan is right for you? The finding comes after years of debate over whether low-carb plans, such as the Atkins diet, are safe and effective long-term. Such diets slash the consumption of breads, pasta, potatoes, rice, cakes, cookies and some fruits and starchy vegetables while beefing up protein. Nutrition experts have long favored a more conventional diet, which reduces the overall amount of calories and fat and while allowing a wide variety of foods. To compare the two types of diet plans, researchers at three major medical centers tracked the weight loss of more than 300 obese people for two years. Half of participants followed a low-carb diet, consuming about 20 grams of carbohydrates a day for three months, then gradually increased their carb intake over time. (Carbohydrate intake varies by individual, but typically people consume 200 to 400 grams a day.) The other half of dieters followed a low-calorie, low-fat diet of 1,200 to 1,800 calories a day, depending on their weight and gender, with less than 30% of calories from fat. Everyone exercised, kept track All dieters were encouraged to be physically active. They started out with 10 minutes a day of exercise, most of it walking, four days a week and then worked up to at least 50 minutes a day four days a week. Participants in both groups were taught behavioral skills such as setting reasonable weight-loss goals, keeping track of what they ate, recovering from episodes of overeating, reversing small weight gains, sticking with a regular program of physical activity such as walking, and steering clear of places and activities associated with overeating. The study, paid for by the National Institutes of Health and published in Tuesday\'s Annals of Internal Medicine show that dieters on both plans: •Lost an average of 11% of their starting weight, or roughly 24 pounds, after one year. •Lost and kept off about 7%, or roughly 15 pounds, at the end of two years. •Had similar changes in total cholesterol, blood pressure, percentage of body fat and bone density, but those in the low-carb group had about two times better improvements in their good (HDL) cholesterol than people in the low-fat group. You can do well on either of these diets if you make practical changes that help you stick to the program, says the study\'s lead author, Gary Foster, director of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University in Philadelphia. ""People think high-this, low-that. It\'s a lot of mental gymnastics,"" he says. ""What they should do is pick a plan they can stick with and then spend their attention on strategies that help them adhere to that plan."" He highly recommends writing down all foods and beverages you consume, which has been shown to be effective in short-term and long-term weight loss, he says. He also advises limiting the places and activities associated with overeating. And he tells people to be specific about the changes they are going to make. For instance, instead of vowing ""I\'m going to cut fat,"" say, ""I\'m going to eat low-fat popcorn instead of potato chips at night."" Or instead of saying ""I\'m going to exercise more,"" say ""I\'m going to walk while my son is at soccer practice three days a week,"" he says. ""What we say to patients is \'Plans work better than platitudes.\' "" Foster says the study also shows that ""low-carb diets appear not to be associated with as many adverse consequences as people have thought."" Eric Westman, an internist and director of the Duke Lifestyle Medicine Clinic in Durham, N.C., has done studies on the low-carb diet and uses it to help people lose weight. ""It\'s great to see the science confirm what we see clinically,"" says Westman, a co-author of The New Atkins for a New You. It\'s good news that the low-carb plan doesn\'t impact bone density but elevates good cholesterol more than the other diet, he says. He has some patients consuming 20 grams of carbs a day for a year or longer, ""so we see better results than in this study,"" he says. ""We see people losing 50 to 70 pounds a year."" What kind of eater are you? Keith Ayoob, a registered dietitian at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, says: ""I\'m all for people losing weight, but I\'m also for people eating a healthful diet. You can lose weight eating 20 grams of carbohydrates a day, but you won\'t get enough fiber, vitamins and minerals without taking supplements. ""People have to decide what kind of eaters they are. Those who don\'t particularly like fruits, vegetables and whole grains may be able to stick with the low-carb diet, but for those want to see some volume on their plate, 20 grams of carbs a day isn\'t going to give them much. I wouldn\'t suggest anyone go below 120 grams of carbohydrates a day.""

This, they said, is due to the procedure\'s use of a slender medical device called an endoscope, which when inserted into the target region provides a continuous real-time image of the culprit cells.\n\nThe traditional means for getting at misfiring cells relies on pre-intervention X-rays for a much less precise snapshot form of visual guidance.\n\nThe findings are reported by study author Dr. Vivek Y.

(July 17, 2017) - Moffitt Cancer Center researchers launched a first of its kind study comparing the long-term benefits of radiation therapy in women with breast cancer either before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant). Their study, published in the June 30 issue of Breast Cancer Research, found that patients who have neoadjuvant radiation therapy have a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor at any site.\n\nThe majority of patients who have early stage breast cancer have surgery to remove their tumor or a complete mastectomy. Surgery is commonly followed by radiation therapy, which has been shown to increase relapse-free survival. However, in some cases, patients may require neoadjuvant radiation therapy to decrease the size of the tumor before surgery. Currently, there are no studies that have analyzed the long-term effects of neoadjuvant radiation therapy on breast cancer patients.\n\nMoffitt researchers compared the overall survival and the time to diagnosis of a second tumor, if any, of 250,195 breast cancer patients who received either neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy. They analyzed patient outcomes from a National Cancer Institute (NCI) registry database of cancer incidence and survival rates in the United States. They included female patients in the analysis who were diagnosed between 1973 and 2011 with early-stage breast cancer. The analysis included 2,554 women who received localized neoadjuvant breast radiation therapy before surgery and 247,641 women who received localized adjuvant breast radiation therapy after surgery.\n\nThe researchers discovered that among the breast cancer patients who tested positive for the estrogen receptor (ER) biomarker, patients who had neoadjuvant radiation therapy had a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor than patients who had adjuvant radiation therapy. This was true for patients who underwent both partial and complete mastectomies. The researchers found that delaying surgery due to neoadjuvant radiation therapy was not a detriment to survival.\n\nA number of recent studies have suggested that radiation therapy may re-educate and stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells. ""The observed benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy aligns with the growing body of literature of the immune activation effects of radiation, including shrinking of untreated metastases outside the radiation field,"" explained Heiko Enderling, Ph.D., associate member of Moffitt\'s Integrated Mathematical Oncology Department.\n\nThese data are promising, but randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy. ""Historic data indicate that disease-free survival is significantly increased when radiation therapy is applied before surgery rather than after surgery, especially for ER-positive patients. These findings are worthy of a prospective clinical trial to confirm potential benefits of neoadjuvant vs. adjuvant radiation, and to identify the potential contribution of radiation-induced immunity to vaccinate against future disease,"" said Enderling.\n\n###\n\nThe study was supported by funds received from the American Cancer Society and the DeBartolo Family Personalized Medicine Institute Pilot Research Awards in Personalized Medicine.\n\nAbout Moffitt Cancer Center\n\nMoffitt is dedicated to one lifesaving mission: to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer. The Tampa-based facility is one of only 48 National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers, a distinction that recognizes Moffitt\'s excellence in research, clinical trials, prevention and cancer control. Moffitt is the No. 6 cancer hospital in the nation and has been listed in U.S. News & World Report as one of the ""Best Hospitals"" for cancer care since 1999. Moffitt devotes more than 2.5 million square feet to research and patient care. Moffitt\'s expert nursing staff is recognized by the American Nurses Credentialing Center with Magnet® status, its highest distinction. With more than 5,200 team members, Moffitt has an economic impact in the state of $2.1 billion.

The study the release is based on drew data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, a national registry that’s been collecting data on cancer cases nationwide since the 1970s.
We like how the release clearly summarized the source of the data — a very large database of cancer cases spanning several decades.
But it’s important to keep in mind that the evidence supporting the treatment approach comes from a retrospective study, not randomized controlled clinical trials, and that point could have been made earlier. The SEER database didn’t capture why some early stage breast cancer patients were treated with pre-surgical — or neoadjuvant — radiation therapy but the release speculates that it was to reduce the size of the tumor before surgery. This treatment strategy also hasn’t been shown to improve survival as stated in the subhead; a randomized clinical trial that follows patients over a period of time is required to study survival outcomes.

We haven’t had any entertaining with beers. So that’s why I developed this pill – for my friend,” Hoon Sunwoo, an associated professor of pharmaceutical sciences at UAlberta, told the CBC.\n\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder in the small intestine that makes patients sensitive to gluten. Patients would take Sunwoo’s pill five minutes before eating and have a one-to-two hour window of eating foods they typically avoid, the CBC reported.\n\nHowever, Sunwoo warns the pill is neither a long-term solution for patients nor is it a cure for the disease— just an aid to help improve quality of life.\n\n“This is not treating the celiac disease or curing celiac disease,” he told local media. “It’s just to try to help them improve their quality of life so when they want to socialize with peers or friends.”\n\nResearchers expect to begin clinical trials with the pill in 2016, CBC reported.']","A poor-quality news release spawned weak coverage from the CBC, which is paraphrased here by Fox with even less context and nuance. Failure on many levels.","This Fox News story demonstrates anew that repeating a weak story does not strengthen it. The brief account reports that Canadian researchers have developed a “new pill” that may do for people with celiac disease (CD) what lactase enzyme tablets do for those with intolerance to lactose-rich dairy foods: make it easy and possible for them to enjoy foods they must currently avoid. The story claims that a pill composed of egg yolk-derived antibodies that prevent gluten protein absorption “may help” diners enjoy pizza and beer by popping it just before digging in. On the upside, the report does quote the pill’s developer cautioning that the “antibody supplement” won’t treat or cure celiac disease. On the more egregious downside, however, the story more or less presents the pill as a done deal, which it is not; and it offers not a word about the research underpinning the claim, which appears to be based on work done only in cell culture — not even rodents. There have been no clinical trials (which the story mentions in the last sentence), and the entire report seems to be rehash of a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation story, which in turn was based on a vague news release issued by the University of Alberta. This is a negative three-fer: neither the news release nor the CBC story — and thus not the Fox News report — presented any scientific data to support the “news” or even mentioned the actual cell culture research paper published in the journal BMC Immunology. As one of our reviewers aptly noted, a “polluted health news stream” brought this story to readers and viewers — a poorly done news release recopied by CBC and re-re-copied by Fox.

""If we could use this with other markers, we could probably identify people early on and, if we could do that, we\'d have a much better chance of helping to make sure that their language development is normal.""\n\nThe finding is slated to be presented Wednesday at the International Meeting for Autism Research in Philadelphia.\n\nBut another expert pointed out that the study is still extremely preliminary.\n\n""It\'s a very early study. They have a long way to go before they\'re actually able to implement a test like this,"" said Keith Young, vice chairman of research in psychiatry and behavioral science at the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in Temple.\n\nBefore bringing it to clinics, researchers need to make sure this test isn\'t detecting other developmental delays such as dyslexia, he noted.\n\n""I wouldn\'t want to be telling people your kid has autism when the problem is that they\'re dyslexic,"" Young said.\n\nAnd when it is ready for prime time, it probably won\'t be applicable to all children with autism.\n\n""This is probably not going to be used for wide-scale screening but it could be used for children who we have some sense that they have autism and want to gather more information,"" said David Amaral, president of the International Society for Autism Research and research director of the University of California Davis MIND Institute. ""There are many, many different types of autism. There are some children with autism who don\'t have these specific abnormalities in brain function.""\n\nRight now, experts have little to go by in detecting autism other than carefully monitoring the regular developmental milestones in children, Young said.\n\n""We do need something,"" he said.\n\n""One of the hallmark features of autism is deficits in language acquisition,"" Eyler explained. ""Whereas the typical developing kid will have an explosion of their language ability starting at about 12 months in both comprehension and production, kids in autism delay don\'t start comprehending or producing until later, and they don\'t ever have that kind of explosion. About 50 percent of kids with autism never develop language,"" she noted.\n\n""We were interested in what was going on in the earliest period of life that could account for these differences,"" she continued.\n\nFor this study, Eyler and her colleagues monitored the brain activity of 30 children with an autism spectrum disorder (aged 14 months to 46 months) and 14 ""typical"" children of roughly the same age.\n\nChildren slept in the MRI machine while researchers read them bedtime stories. This allowed the investigators to see which parts of the brain were being activated in typical children versus children with autism.\n\n""We were looking for areas of the brain that are more responsive during listening to bedtime stories than when they\'re not hearing that,"" Eyler said.\n\nIn the typically developing children, both sides of the brain involved in language processing were activated. In the youngest children, the activation was about equal in both the right and left hemisphere, while in the older children, activity became more pronounced on the left side, which is similar to adult patterns and to be expected, Eyler explained.\n\nBut in the autistic children, there was slightly more right hemisphere response than left hemisphere, and there was no change in activity across the age range.\n\n""We didn\'t see that growth of the left hemisphere [in the children with autism],"" Eyler said.\n\n""We now feel pretty confident that, in many children with autism, there are alterations either in structure growth or connectivity of the brain, but we really don\'t understand the implications of that for core features of autism, one of which is problems with communication,"" Amaral said. ""This provides more evidence for abnormal connectivity in the brain.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe Autism Society of America has more on this disorder.']","It’s not really clear how much ""new hope"" there was in this story or the underlying study.  But as pioneering science writer Victor Cohn quipped, there are only two types of health news stories:  new hope and no hope.  ","In a story reported before the study results were even presented at a scientific meeting, researchers suggest that key differences seen using functional magnetic resonance imaging may be a key diagnostic tool for autism.  The story headline suggests the test is a ""new hope"" for diagnosing the disorder.  The reader is then provided with a series of conflicting statements about the value of the test and its relative prospects as a diagnostic method.  While the story does provide a balance of opinion by quoting two additional experts, the enthusiasm displayed in the opening paragraph and headline make this a less than desirable report.

In combination, they are used to treat pseudobulbar affect, a neurological disorder involving involuntary crying or other emotional displays.\n\nThe scientists randomized 152 Alzheimer’s patients to a 10-week course of dextromethorphan-quinidine and 127 to placebo. Researchers then rated them using a well-validated scale that measures aggression and agitation. The study is in the Sept. 22 issue of JAMA.\n\nAggression scores declined to 3.8 from 7.1 in the dextromethorphan-quinidine group and to 5.3 from 7.0 in those who took a placebo.

While it manages to provide some insight into the study with its scant 226 words, the story also presents readers with an overly optimistic view of the findings, omits discussion of the high costs of this drug, and never clues readers into the potential conflicts of interest at play. The accompanying editorial in the same edition of JAMA provides a more realistic view of the study and its importance; “… the data from the study by Cummings et al are important, but not overwhelming, and a second independent study with longer duration is needed to confirm the treatment effect.”

Everyday behaviours and optional app support are used to cue imagery practice until it becomes a cognitive habit.\n\nMaximum contact time was four hours of individual consultation, and neither group received any additional dietary advice or information.\n\nDr Solbrig, who completed the work as part of a PhD funded by The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) South West Peninsula, said: ""It\'s fantastic that people lost significantly more weight on this intervention, as, unlike most studies, it provided no diet/physical activity advice or education. People were completely free in their choices and supported in what they wanted to do, not what a regimen prescribed.""\n\nThe study showed how after six months people who used the FIT intervention lost an average of 4.11kg, compared with an average of 0.74kg among the MI group.\n\nAfter 12 months - six months after the intervention had finished - the FIT group continued to lose weight, with an average of 6.44kg lost compared with 0.67kg in the MI group.\n\nDr Solbrig continued: ""Most people agree that in order to lose weight, you need to eat less and exercise more, but in many cases, people simply aren\'t motivated enough to heed this advice - however much they might agree with it. So FIT comes in with the key aim of encouraging someone to come up with their own imagery of what change might look and feel like to them, how it might be achieved and kept up, even when challenges arise.\n\n""We started with taking people through an exercise about a lemon. We asked them to imagine seeing it, touching it, juicing it, drinking the juice and juice accidently squirting in their eye, to emphasise how emotional and tight to our physical sensations imagery is. From there we are able to encourage them to fully imagine and embrace their own goals. Not just \'imagine how good it would be to lose weight\' but, for example, \'what would losing weight enable you to do that you can\'t do now? What would that look / sound / smell like?\', and encourage them to use all of their senses.\n\n""As well as being delighted by the success of the study in the short term, there are very few studies that document weight loss past the end of treatment, so to see that people continued to lose weight despite not having any support shows the sustainability and effectiveness of this intervention.""\n\nTrisha Bradbury was one of the participants allocated to the FIT study, and she explains: ""I lost my mum at 60, and being 59 myself with a variety of health problems, my motivation was to be there for my daughter. I kept thinking about wearing the dress I\'d bought for my daughter\'s graduation, and on days I really didn\'t feel like exercising, kept picturing how I\'d feel.\n\n""I\'ve gone from 14 stone to 12 stone 2 and have managed to lower the dosage I need for my blood pressure tablets. I\'d still like to lose a touch more, but I\'m so delighted with the mind-set shift.""\n\nProfessor Jackie Andrade, Professor in Psychology at the University of Plymouth, is one of the co-creators of FIT, and she explains: ""FIT is based on two decades of research showing that mental imagery is more strongly emotionally charged than other types of thought. It uses imagery to strengthen people\'s motivation and confidence to achieve their goals, and teaches people how to do this for themselves, so they can stay motivated even when faced with challenges. We were very excited to see that our intervention achieved exactly what we had hoped for and that it helped our participants achieve their goals and most importantly to maintain them.""\n\n###\n\nThe full study, entitled Functional Imagery Training versus Motivational Interviewing for Weight Loss: A randomised controlled trial of brief individual interventions for overweight and obesity is available to view in the International Journal of Obesity (doi: 10.1038/s41366-018-0122-1).']",Were researchers comparing apples and oranges?,"The news release focuses on a study reporting that overweight individuals who engaged in functional imagery training (FIT) were more successful at losing weight than individuals who engaged in a type of talk therapy called motivational interviewing (MI). However, the release does not answer many questions that are relevant to determining how useful FIT is for weight loss. For example, because the study does not appear to have collected information on diet or exercise, it’s not clear whether the difference in outcomes stems from differences in lifestyle choices made by study participants.
It would have been helpful if the release (and study) had analyzed specifically how increased motivation and lifestyle choices can result in weight loss. The published study notes that data relating to “participants’ experiences and process variables, including frequency of motivational cognitions, self-efficacy for diet and physical activity, self-reported diet and physical activity” were collected but that the results would be reported separately.

The drug, from a company called Rigel, is R788 or fostamatinib disodium. The oral drug targets an enzyme called Syk. Nobody is exactly sure of the role Syk plays in rheumatoid arthritis. But there\'s an overabundance of Syk in the fluid of arthritic joints, and the enzyme is part of the runaway immune machinery that increases joint inflammation.\n\nExperimental Drug Fights RA In a pilot study, the drug appeared to reduce symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Now Harvard researcher Michael E. Weinblatt, MD, reports results from a phase II clinical trial in which 457 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment received R788 or placebo for six months. For patients treated with the more active twice-daily dose of 100 milligrams of R788: 67% had at least 20% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 35% of patients getting a placebo.\n\n43% had at least 50% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 19% getting a placebo.\n\n28% had at least 70% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 10% getting a placebo.\n\nR788 Side Effects The drug does have side effects. Among patients getting the twice-daily 100 milligram dose: 19% had diarrhea, compared to 3% getting a placebo.\n\n14% had upper respiratory infections, compared to 7% getting a placebo.\n\n6% had low white blood cell counts, compared to 1% getting a placebo.\n\n23% had to start or increase blood pressure medication, compared to 7% getting a placebo. There\'s at least one theoretical concern about R788. Normally, the Syk enzyme helps suppress tumors. Women with breast tumors have low levels of Syk. It\'s not clear whether long-term use of R788 will increase cancer risk; longer-term clinical trials will have to evaluate this risk. For now, R788 looks very promising, the researchers report. ""Inhibition of the Syk pathway offers a new drug target for rheumatoid arthritis,"" Weinblatt and colleagues conclude. The Weinblatt study and an editorial by NIH researchers Juan Rivera, PhD, and Robert A. Colbert, MD, PhD, appear in the Sept. 30 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Rigel funded the study, and three of the study\'s six authors are Rigel employees. Weinblatt reports receiving grants, fees, or honoraria from a number of drug and biomedical companies, including Rigel.']"," In health news stories, numbers can be helpful or numbers can be numbing.  Unfortunately, this story was high on stats but low on analysis.","This WebMD story offers an interesting approach to covering a clinical trial for a new arthritis drug.

In a study of 195 asymptomatic women with dense breast tissue who had a negative mammogram within the previous 11 months, AB-MR detected five additional cancers after a negative screening mammography, according to preliminary findings from a Penn Medicine team presented this week at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the cancer detection rate of mammography is roughly 4 cancers in 1,000 women who have a mammogram. Digital tomosynthesis (DBT), or 3D mammography, does slightly better, detecting approximately 25 percent more cancers, or roughly 5 cancers in 1,000 women screened. Based on the preliminary results at Penn Medicine, the cancer detection rate of AB-MR screening is 25 cancers per 1,000 patients. One in eight women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point during their life.\n\n""Having dense breast tissue makes it more difficult to detect a cancer on a mammogram,"" said the study\'s lead author, Susan Weinstein, MD, an associate professor of Radiology and the director of breast MRI at Penn Medicine. ""Based on the literature and our results, women with dense breast tissue who desire supplemental screening, these results suggest that AB-MR may be a better option than other supplemental screening tests such as whole breast ultrasound.\n\nThe most common exam offered for asymptomatic patients seeking supplemental screening is a whole breast screening ultrasound examination. However, screening ultrasound examinations have higher rates of false positives, meaning more cases of positive screenings where no cancer is present.\n\nBased on the results from Penn\'s study, the AB-MR may be a better option. American Cancer Society guidelines currently recommend a full breast MRI, not an AB-MR, in women who, based on family history of breast or ovarian cancer and/or previous treatment for Hodgkin disease, have a 20 to 25 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer.\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Weinstein, additional authors include Mitchell D.

The antibodies target the cholesterol-regulating protein PCSK9 and lower the levels of LDL, the so-called ""bad"" cholesterol, by 60 percent.\n\nThe results, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, also show that the drugs have a significant effect on reducing heart attacks and overall mortality.\n\nNew cholesterol drug could be biggest advance since statins\n\n""It seems that the group that takes them, compared to the group that doesn\'t, has half the rate of cardiovascular events and mortality as those that don\'t,"" Dr. Seth S. Martin of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine told CBS News.\n\nCurrent guidelines suggest cholesterol be treated with statins, a class of drugs that inhibit an enzyme that plays an important role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. But some patients can\'t tolerate the side effects, which can include headache, difficulty sleeping, muscle aches, diarrhea, constipation and nausea or vomiting.\n\nOthers have such high cholesterol that taking statins alone is not enough. These new drugs ""could be for someone who needs an addition to statin, or it could be instead of statin,"" Martin said.\n\nIn an editorial published along with the study, experts note that although the results are promising, more long-term research is needed to make definitive conclusions about the drug.']","Relying on an inflated relative risk reduction and failing to discuss potential harms, this story gives readers a too-rosy view of the likely impact of a new class of cholesterol-lowering medicines.","This story reports on an analysis of studies involving a new class of cholesterol drugs known as PSCK9 inhibitors. (We’ve previously written about other studies of these drugs and reviewed the related news coverage.) The analysis looked at 24 different smaller studies involving more than 10,000 patients. While it’s clear that levels of “bad” cholesterol were lowered substantially, the question of whether that will save lives from future heart attacks is less clear. The story doesn’t convey that nuance, and emphasizes instead that risk of heart attacks was cut in half with these drugs. But that “halving” of risk means that the heart attack rate went from 1% to around 0.5% — probably not the dramatic reduction that most readers were envisioning. It also misses on several other elements that we think are important for health care stories to convey. Our review offers some suggestions for how the story could have used its 300 words more effectively.

Watson erupts in tears as she calls her mother to say this is the first time she\'s been able to write her name in ages.\n\nWhen the lights went up, Nadella welcomed both Lawton and engineer Zhang on stage, thanking them for showing that thanks ""developers can have impact.""\n\nEmma Watch remains a prototype, Microsoft says, but the developers are working with a neuroscience research team to undertake trials with a small group of Parkinson\'s sufferers.\n\nThe watch works through a combination of sensors and AI (artificial intelligence) techniques to potentially detect and monitor symptoms like tremors, stiffness and instability, among others, according to Microsoft. ""Once these symptoms can be identified and measured, it’s possible to develop technology and devices that help humans manage their symptoms. AI is used to classify the sensor information and elicit real-time responses on small devices like wearables.""\n\nMicrosoft stresses that Emma Watch is not a cure for the disease, which afflicts 10 million people. ""Rather, its technology has the potential to help Parkinson’s patients manage symptoms that impede regular functions. The goal of further research is to determine whether Emma Watch could help other people with similar Parkinson’s symptoms.""\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.']","Seeing is not believing when it comes to a medical intervention; many factors, including a placebo effect, can make an intervention seem like it works when it doesn’t.","This USA Today story covers a video and a conference talk about a wrist gadget that Microsoft researchers designed for Emma, a person with Parkinson’s disease — an ailment for which there is no cure and affects 10 million people worldwide and 1 million in the US (60,000 people in the country are diagnosed each year).
The video shows how the vibrating device (named the “Emma Project”) appears to calm the woman’s hand tremors enough to write and draw at a basic and recently unattainable level. It’s an undeniably heartwarming story, but this story overplays its hand. Seeing is not believing when it comes to a medical intervention; many factors, including a placebo effect, can make an intervention seem like it works when it doesn’t.
Also, just because it seems to work for one person doesn’t mean it will for others, or to the same degree. This work is, in effect, a non-study with a sample size of one. There’s not enough here to show the device does or does not work; all we know is that it appears to for this woman. A fairer headline would have left no room to potentially mislead readers, i.e. “Microsoft shows off watch that quiets one woman’s Parkinson’s tremors.”

1118,story_reviews_00602,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/story-on-speculative-metformin-health-benefits-needed-a-nod-to-potential-harms/,2015-06-15 04:00:00,An old-line diabetes drug may have new uses against diseases of aging,"['Just over a year ago, Catherine Price decided to start taking one of the cheapest, safest, oldest, most widely prescribed drugs for Type 2 diabetes. So much metformin is taken in the United States — some 72 million prescriptions were written for it in 2013 — that a recent study found higher trace levels of it (presumably from the urine of people taking it) in Lake Michigan than of any other drug, including caffeine.\n\nBut Price, a science and medical reporter in Oakland, Calif., doesn’t have Type 2 diabetes. She has Type 1, the far less common form of the disease, which requires lifelong treatment with insulin, to compensate for her body’s failure to produce enough of the hormone. However, she had read studies indicating that metformin combined with insulin might help Type 1 diabetics, too. Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia — not just for diabetics, but for everyone.\n\nFor Price, there was yet another possible benefit — as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome, an endocrine disorder that doctors thought might explain the difficulty she and her husband had had conceiving.\n\nSure enough, a month and a half after she had started taking metformin pills and even as she was enjoying the benefits of better blood-sugar control, Price became pregnant, eventually giving birth to a girl.\n\n“I’m still taking metformin along with my insulin,” said Price, 36, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 14 years ago. “I remember eating Mexican food one night, which can be a potential disaster for people with diabetes because of the carbs, but I noticed I needed only two-thirds to a half of the insulin I normally needed.”\n\nSynthesized in the 1920s, metformin was first approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom in 1958. It took until 1995 to get approval in the United States after a potentially fatal disorder linked to a similar drug was found to be rarely if ever associated with metformin.\n\nUnlike insulin shots, which help Type 1 diabetics break down sugar and starches in the blood, metformin lowers blood-sugar levels primarily by squelching the liver’s tendency to release stored-up sugar into the bloodstream. Keeping that extra sugar (actually a form of sugar called glucose) out of the blood helps to maintain normal blood-sugar levels, thereby preventing such long-term complications as blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.\n\nAbout 29 million people in the United States have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90 percent of them have Type 2, in which their bodies slowly fail to respond to normal levels of insulin, forcing their pancreas to produce so much that it’s eventually exhausted. The estimated 2.5 million with Type 1, in contrast, lose their ability to produce insulin, usually within a matter of months, due to an autoimmune attack by the body on itself.\n\nToday, the range of ailments being targeted by metformin, a prescription drug sold under such names as Glucophage, Glumetza, Fortamet and Riomet, all share one characteristic: They are diseases related to aging.\n\n“Metformin actually lowers the rate of cell turnover,” said Michael Pollak, who has been studying metformin’s effects on pancreatic cancer as chairman of oncology at McGill University in Montreal. “It makes cells divide less quickly. The rate-of-living theory defines aging as the number of cell divisions you undergo since you were a fertilized egg. If the theory is true, then people who age more gracefully have a slower rate of cell division. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.”\n\nPollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. For now, the evidence suggesting benefits is limited to large studies of diabetics that have found, on average that those who take metformin tend to have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and dementia, and to live longer overall than those who take other drugs for diabetes. Those effects have also been seen in animal studies. But such evidence often does not pan out in human studies.\n\nAt a medical meeting in May, Pollak reported disappointing results from his first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin for people with pancreatic cancer. “It yielded no benefit,” he said. “Plain old metformin given in the same dose as we do for Type 2 diabetes doesn’t seem to be a breakthrough for cancer, at least for pancreatic cancer.”\n\nMany other metformin clinical trials are underway for breast, colorectal, endometrial and other cancers.\n\nFor heart disease, the benefit of metformin over most other drugs for Type 2 diabetics has been seen repeatedly in clinical trials. For people without diabetes, only one study has been published, finding no apparent effect after 18 months. As with cancer, however, other studies are underway.\n\nFor dementia, which people with Type 2 diabetes have double the risk of developing compared with non-diabetics, metformin has been found in a number of studies to cut that risk substantially.\n\n“There’s been a lot of excitement about metformin and dementia,” said Rachel Whitmer, an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente in California.\n\nIn 2013, Whitmer presented the results of a study of about 15,000 people newly prescribed a medication for Type 2 diabetes: By the end of the five-year study, those who received metformin had a 40 percent lower risk of having developed dementia than those prescribed sulfonylureas, another common type of diabetes drug.\n\nBut, Whitmer notes, “I don’t think the story is complete. There needs to be more work in this area with all drugs for diabetes.”\n\nFor Type 1 diabetes, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine published a study in May in which they added either a low dose of metformin or placebo pills to the insulin regimen of 74 adolescents. Those who received metformin lost weight — generally a benefit for those with diabetes — and needed less insulin after six months. Those who received the placebo needed more insulin than at the beginning of the study and saw their blood pressure rise. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control.\n\n“There is some benefit, but it wasn’t the full benefit we hoped for,” said Helen Nickerson, senior scientific program manager at JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which partly funded the study. Even so, she said, she is hearing from doctors that growing numbers of them are prescribing metformin along with insulin to patients with Type 1 diabetes.\n\nNo one would suggest that a person with Type 1 diabetes stop taking their insulin. Doing so would be life-threatening. For those with Type 1, metformin is being tested only as an add-on to insulin.\n\nJDRF, meanwhile, is funding a clinical trial to see if metformin will reduce the risk of heart disease in people with Type 1, and it is funding a trial in Britain to see if the drug will prevent children from developing Type 1 in the first place.\n\nTerry Wilkin, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Exeter, is leading the prevention trial. He theorizes that the risk of developing Type 1 rises when excess demand for insulin is placed on the pancreas in children who are even slightly overweight. His study will give low daily doses of metformin to children who are at high risk of developing Type 1.\n\n“If we can even slightly lower their average blood sugar with metformin,” Wilkin said, “I believe we can have a big benefit on their risk of developing Type 1.”\n\nDespite all these potential benefits of metformin — and despite a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association that it be tried before any other drug for newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics — a recent study found that only about half of all such people get metformin as their first prescribed medication. The study does not explain why that might be. Among the possibilities, experts say, are that newer drugs are being pushed heavily in direct-to-patient advertising and that some patients are turned off by the common though mild side effect of metformin — stomach upset and diarrhea — which can usually be avoided by starting on a low dose.\n\nThe author of the study, Niteesh Choudhry, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, also found that newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics who start on metformin are the least likely to need an additional diabetes drug later.\n\n“It’s clear that physicians and patients are not always choosing to start on metformin,” he said. “There are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another. But the guidelines do recommend metformin first.”\n\nFor patients with Type 2 whose doctor started them on a drug other than metformin, he said, “I certainly would encourage people to talk with their doctor. That’s always a good thing.”\n\nHurley is a New Jersey-based science journalist who writes frequently on diabetes and health.']",An interesting and important topic. But the enthusiasm of this story’s intro may overwhelm subsequent cautions and caveats.,"Researchers are exploring the potentially broader utility of a well-known drug, metformin, which has traditionally been employed to control type 2 diabetes. Studies are under way to test the impact of the drug on everything from type 1 diabetes to dementia to cancer. Those efforts, to date, have offered varied results, from substantial to modest to none. This story is appropriately cautious about the ultimate value of the drug and delivers some useful information to the reader. However, its caution is somewhat overwhelmed by an anecdotal beginning in which a user testifies to the drug’s broader benefits. The discussion of potential harms is also not in balance with the enthusiasm over possible benefits.

An estimated 22 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea, putting them at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke and memory loss. Patients who are older, overweight and male are generally most at-risk, reports CBS News correspondent David Begnaud.\n\n""I wasn\'t breathin\'. I wasn\'t getting the correct amount of oxygen.

Exhausted, the 59-year-old could barely do her job as a nurse – and she knew something wasn\'t right.\n\n""I knew I was in trouble,"" Siravo said.\n\nSiravo has severe obstructive sleep apnea, where her throat muscles relax, blocking her airway and disrupting her sleep. On average, she stops breathing 53 times an hour, that\'s nearly once every minute during a night\'s sleep. She said on a night, she could be up four hours and sleep two.\n\n\n\nShe did not find relief from the CPAP machine, a common treatment that delivers constant pressurized air. She even needed oxygen on top of that.\n\n\n\n""And then that didn\'t work. That\'s when they introduced me to Inspire and saved my life,"" Siravo said.\n\n""Inspire"" is an FDA-approved pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest. It senses when breathing slows down and sends an electrical pulse to the tongue to stimulate it forward, keeping the airway open.\n\n\n\n""This has been revolutionary. It\'s been a game changer,"" Dr. Maurits Boon said. He is Siravo\'s doctor at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n""She\'d given up. And she had memory issues, she was miserable,"" Boon said. ""This is not a benign disease… it actually shortens people\'s lives.""\n\nA few months after having the Inspire device implanted, Siravo went to a sleep lab to see how it was working. They ran tests throughout the night. Early the next morning, Boon revealed the results.\n\n\n\n""So before we activated the device, we have all sorts of problems… This is basically your brain saying, \'I\'m not breathing.\' … And after we activate the device it\'s perfect,"" Boon explained.

The story focuses on one patient’s experience with a technology called Inspire, which is an implantable device used to treat one particular form of sleep apnea (obstructive).
While sleep apnea is a common problem in the United States, the story does little to place the work in context. Instead, the story cites a medical professional who calls it “revolutionary” and a “game-changer” without telling readers that the doctor is a consultant for Inspire. There is also no objective medical assessment of the device’s effectiveness, as the medical professional quoted is also the treating physician. It’s also not clear why the story came out now, given that Inspire has been on the market for a few years and that the evidence cited is from 2014.

The alternative therapy reduced hot flashes by as much as 74% in the study conducted by researchers at Baylor University’s Mind-Body Medicine Research Laboratory and funded by the National Institutes of Health. Only hormone therapy, which many women can’t take or want to avoid, is more effective for treating the most common symptom of menopause, says researcher Gary R. Elkins, PhD. “If you compare this treatment with off-label use of antidepressants or other non-hormonal therapies, it works as well or better,” he says.\n\nHot Flashes, Night Sweats Hot flashes are a sudden rush of heat, followed by facial flushing and sweating, often followed by chills and clamminess. The progression is familiar to most women of a certain age. Hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting some 80% of women. They are linked to declining estrogen levels, but it remains unclear just why the sudden lack of estrogen sends the body into thermal mayhem, and why some women are more affected than others. Hormone therapy is a very effective treatment for menopause-related hot flashes, but concerns about risks have limited its use among women. “There is certainly a need for non-pharmacologic treatments for hot flashes and night sweats,” says North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Executive Director Margery Gass, MD.']","This was a story on a small, short-term study, the limitations of which were not defined.","WebMD fell short of the competing LA Times story in reporting on this study.

Those who do worse in the tests will be the ones most likely to succumb to Alzheimer’s later in life, scientists now believe.\n\nBy identifying potential patients far earlier than is possible at present, researchers hope it should then become easier in the long term to develop treatments aimed at halting or slowing their condition.\n\n“It is usually thought memory is the first attribute affected in Alzheimer’s,” said project leader Dennis Chan, a neuroscientist based at Cambridge University. “But difficulty with navigation is increasingly recognised as one of the very earliest symptoms. This may predate the onset of other symptoms.\n\n“By pinpointing those who are beginning to lose their navigational skills, we hope to show that we can target people at a much earlier stage of the condition and one day become far more effective in treating them.”\n\nThe discovery that loss of navigational skills was associated with Alzheimer’s disease was made several years ago by Chan and colleagues based at several centres in the UK. These studies used tablet computers to test navigational tasks.\n\nBut now scientists plan to take their tests to a new level with the use of the virtual reality sets in which wearers are immersed in simulated environments through which they must navigate.\n\nAround 300 people, aged between 40 and 60, will be recruited to take part in the study. Some will have a gene that puts them at risk of the condition or will come from a family with a history of Alzheimer’s. Not all will be destined to be affected by the disease, however. Chan’s project aims to find out who will.\n\nWearing virtual reality headsets, participants will be asked to navigate their way towards, and then remember details of, a series of different environments.\n\n“We will make a note of those who have particular problems and see if these are the ones who are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s,” explained Chan. “The aim of the study is very simple: can we detect changes in brain function before people are aware that they have them?”\n\nResearchers recently pinpointed the significance of a tiny area of the brain known as the entorhinal cortex, which acts as a hub in a widespread brain network that controls navigation. This now appears to be the first part of the brain that succumbs to Alzheimer’s.\n\n“The entorhinal cortex is the first brain region to show degeneration when you get Alzheimer’s, and that is where we shall be focusing our research,” said Chan, whose work is funded by the Alzheimer’s Society.\n\nThe goal of the work is to help people as they develop the disease. “To date, drug trials for Alzheimer’s have been applied when people have already got dementia, by which time considerable damage to the brain has already occurred,” Chan told the Observer.\n\n“If we can develop drugs and administer them earlier, for instance before the disease has spread beyond the entorhinal cortex, then this would have the potential to prevent the onset of dementia.”']","The story’s headline states: “Virtual reality to help detect early risk of Alzheimer’s.” That is misleading.

The story’s headline states: “Virtual reality to help detect early risk of Alzheimer’s.” That is misleading.

This may be especially true for people with serious mental illness, a study finds. When people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were asked who or what helped them manage the condition, many said it was pets that helped the most.\n\n""When I\'m feeling really low they are wonderful because they won\'t leave my side for two days,"" one study participant with two dogs and two cats, ""They just stay with me until I am ready to come out of it.""\n\nAnother person said of their pet birds: ""If I didn\'t have my pets I think I would be on my own. You know what I mean, so it\'s — it\'s nice to come home and, you know, listen to the birds singing and that, you know.""\n\nMany people with serious mental illness live at home and have limited contact with the health care system, says Helen Brooks, a mental health researcher at University of Manchester in the United Kingdom and the lead author on the study, which was published Friday in the journal BMC Psychiatry. So they\'re doing a lot of the work of managing their conditions.\n\nBrooks says, ""Many felt deep emotional connections with their pet that weren\'t available from friends and family.""\n\nBrooks and her colleagues interviewed 54 people with serious long-term mental illnesses. Twenty-five of them considered their pets to be a part of their social network. The scientists asked who they went to when they needed help or advice, where they gained emotional support and encouragement and how they spent their days.\n\nThe participants were then given a diagram with three consecutive circles radiating out from a square representing the participant. They were asked to write the people, places and things that gave them support into the circles, with the circles closest to the center being the most important.\n\nSixty percent of the people who considered pets to be a part of their social networks placed them in the central, most important circle — the same place many people put close family and social workers. 20 percent placed pets in the second circle.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Helen Brooks/University of Manchester Helen Brooks/University of Manchester\n\nThe interviews with participants are poignant, and reveal the struggle and isolation that can come with mental illness.\n\n""I think it\'s really hard when you haven\'t had a mental illness to know what the actual experience is [like],"" said one participant. ""There\'s like a chasm, deep chasm between us ... [Other people are] on one side of it, and we\'re on the other side of it. We\'re sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don\'t always — we don\'t always understand.""\n\nPeople with mental illnesses often see their social groups shrink and find themselves alienated from their friends. For many of these people, says Brooks, animals can break through the isolation. They give affection without needing to understand the disorder.\n\n""[Pets] don\'t look at the scars on your arms,"" one participant said. ""They don\'t question where you\'ve been.""\n\nThe pets provided more than just emotional support and companionship, participants said. The animals also could distract them from their illness, even from severe psychosis.\n\nOne study participant placed birds in his closest social circle. When he was hearing voices, he said that they ""help me in the sense, you know, I\'m not thinking about the voices, I\'m just thinking of when I hear the birds singing.""\n\nAnother participant said that merely seeing a hamster climbing the bars on the cage and acting cute helped with some difficult situations.\n\nAnd having to take care of pets keeps people from withdrawing from the world. ""They force me, the cats force me to sort of still be involved,"" said one participant.\n\nAnother said that walking the dog helped them get out of the house and with people. ""That surprised me, you know, the amount of people that stop and talk to him, and that, yeah, it cheers me up with him. I haven\'t got much in my life, but he\'s quite good, yeah.""\n\n""The routine these pets provide is really important for people,"" says Brooks. ""Getting up in the morning to feed them and groom them and walk them, giving them structure and a sense of purpose that they won\'t otherwise have.""\n\nMany of the study participants are unemployed because of their illness, she notes. Having a pet that was well taken care of was a source of pride for them.\n\nMark Longsjo, the program director of adult services at McLean Southeast, an inpatient mental facility in Middleborough, Mass., says that the interviews in the study reflect his professional experiences. ""We have so many patients come through, and we always ask them about their support system. Sometimes its family members, sometimes its friends, but it\'s very common to hear about pets.""\n\nWhen he does patient intake surveys, Longsjo says that he includes pets in their risk assessments. Patients with pets often say the animals help keep them from following through on suicidal thinking, because they know their pets depend on them.\n\nThe social workers at McLean also incorporate pets into their aftercare planning, encouraging patients to make walking and grooming their pets a part of their routine. ""I think there\'s significant value in considering the common everyday pet to be as important as the relationships one has with one\'s family in the course of their treatment,"" says Longsjo. He feels this study is important because, although there\'s a lot of work looking at the benefits of trained therapy animals, they can be expensive and out of the reach of many patients.\n\nBrooks hopes that more health workers will consider incorporating pets into care plans for people with mental illness. Many of her participants said that sometimes it felt like their pets could sense when they needed help the most, and were able to provide it — just like the owners took care of them.\n\nAs one person in the study said, ""When he comes up and sits beside you on a night, it\'s different, you know. It\'s just, like, he needs me as much as I need him.""']",The story should have emphasized that this was a purely observational study of a small group of people who already owned pets.,"
The story focuses on a recent study published in BMC Psychiatry that reports some patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder consider their pets as part of their social network. The finding highlights the importance that some patients with mental illness place on pet ownership, and how some of those patients draw support from their interactions with pets and the routine of caring for their pets.
This story accurately describes the study, but — in our opinion — doesn’t go far enough in placing the work in context. For example, the headline uses strong language: “Pets help people manage the pain of serious mental illness.” However, that headline is based on the self-reporting of 25 patients in the United Kingdom who already own pets and consider them part of their social network. A small, observational study may be interesting, but it needs to be followed up with more robust research to figure out what role — if any — pets can play in treatment for patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The story needed to make that more clear.

Several studies indicate that babies born prematurely receive too little DHA, and some studies have found that premature babies fed DHA after birth show better cognitive performance or visual coordination later on than preemies who aren’t given DHA.\n\nBut the new study, which mainly assessed full-term babies, found no cognitive difference at 18 months whether mothers received DHA supplements or placebos. The lead researcher, Dr. Maria Makrides of the University of Adelaide in Australia, said this suggested that full-term babies already get enough DHA in the womb, and that “there’s no extra boost” from getting more.\n\nNonetheless, several experts said they would continue to support taking DHA in pregnancy, especially since it is safe and apparently has few downsides. They cited a smaller 2003 Norwegian study that found I.Q. increases at age 4, although no cognitive benefit was seen in infants or 7-year-olds.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She said babies in her study might have received more DHA than those in this study. Dr. Oken said the new study might have shown no benefit in 18-month-olds because effects in infants might be “hard to measure” or “it may be that the benefit of DHA is not as important as when you’re 4.”\n\nDr. Makrides’s team plans assessments at 4 and 7. Dr. Jatinder Bhatia, a neonatologist heading the nutrition committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that unless further studies showed no benefit as children got older, he would continue recommending DHA, now in many prenatal vitamins, because “I’m not convinced at this time that we should reverse course.”\n\nMuch about DHA is unknown. Its effect in supplements for children and adults is being studied, as well as whether supplements offer the same benefit as DHA-rich fish, like salmon.\n\nSome studies, including the new report, suggest DHA supplementation in pregnancy reduces the likelihood of premature birth. And the new study showed small reductions in postpartum depression in women with histories or high risk of depression. Dr. Scott Stuart, a University of Iowa psychiatry and psychology professor, said his pregnant patients with mild to moderate depression had improved when taking DHA while seeing a counselor.\n\n“There’s no harm that we know of at all, in contrast to many antidepressants,” he said. “And it might be of some help.”""]","Important issues were given an accurate, but quick overview.  We think a few words or lines about the actual data would have helped women analyze the history of this research much better.

Healthcare-associated MRSA infections are typically linked to invasive procedures or devices, such as surgeries, intravenous tubing or artificial joints. Community-acquired MRSA often begins as a skin boil and is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Individuals at risk include competitive wrestlers, child care workers and those living in crowded conditions.\n\n""We\'ve found that SecA inhibitors are broad-spectrum antimicrobials and are very effective against strains of bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics,"" said Binghe Wang, Regents\' Professor of Chemistry at Georgia State, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Drug Discovery and Georgia Cancer Coalition Distinguished Cancer Scholar. He co-led the study with Phang C. Tai, Regents\' Professor of Biology at Georgia State, who is an expert on the functions of SecA in bacteria. Their findings were published in the journal Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry in November.\n\nBecause of the widespread resistance of bacteria to antibiotics on the market, there is an urgent need for the development of new antimicrobials. MRSA infection is caused by a type of Staphylococcus bacteria that has become resistant to many antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nIn previous work, the researchers developed novel small molecule SecA inhibitors active against the bacteria strains Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis by dissecting a SecA inhibitor called Rose Bengal (RB).\n\nIn this study, they evaluated two potent RB analogs for their activity against MRSA strains. The RB analogs inhibited the ATPase activities of two SecA isoforms identified in S. aureus, SaSecA1 and SaSecA2, as well as the SaSecA1-dependent protein-conducting channel. The inhibitors also reduced the secretion of three toxins from S. aureus and stopped three MRSA strains of bacteria from reproducing.\n\nThe best inhibitor in this group, SCA-50, showed strong activity against MRSA Mu50 strain and an inhibitory effect on MRSA Mu50 that was two-to-60 times more potent than all commonly used antibiotics, including vancomycin, the last resort option for treating MRSA-related infections.\n\nIn a study recently published online in the journal ChemMedChem, the researchers synthesized and evaluated another new class of triazole-pyrimidine analogs as SecA inhibitors. This study also confirmed that SecA inhibitors have the potential for being broad-spectrum antimicrobials, can directly block virulence factor production and can null the effect of efflux pumps.\n\n###\n\nCollaborators for the paper published in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry include Hsiuchin Yang, Hao Zhang, Krishna Damera, Ying-Hsin Hsieh, Arpana Sagwal Chaudhary, Jianmei Cui and Jinshan Jin of Georgia State.\n\nThe study is funded by the National Institutes of Health and Georgia State\'s Center for Biotechnology and Drug Design and Molecular Basis of Diseases Program.\n\nTo read the study, visit http://www. sciencedirect. com/ science/ article/ pii/ S0968089615300523 .']",An advance in the struggle against MRSA is welcome news — for those who can follow the technical description one might find in a journal article.,"This news release from Georgia State University reports on a study proposing a novel antimicrobial approach for combating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Because MRSA is indeed a public health concern, the news release could have included some related statistics. Here’s one from the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases website:
“About one-third of people in the world have S. aureus bacteria on their bodies at any given time…The bacteria can be present without causing an active infection. Of the people with S. aureus present, about 1 percent has MRSA, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).”

But the jury\'s still out as to how worthwhile the extra technology is overall.\n\nFor one thing, computer-aided detection (CAD) increases the amount of diagnostic testing among women who turn out not to have breast cancer. And the technology makes mammograms more expensive.\n\nCAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. ""It\'s an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms,"" he said.\n\nComputer-aided detection systems use a digitized mammogram image from either a traditional film mammogram or a digitally acquired mammogram, according to the American College of Radiology. The CAD software looks for areas that may indicate cancer so the radiologist can then look more closely at the mammogram.\n\nAlthough it has rapidly become part of mammogram screening, Fenton said there is limited and conflicting research on its effect.\n\nUnder Medicare payment rates, doctors get an additional $11 for adding computer-aided detection to a mammogram, said Fenton, citing Medicare data. The Medicare rate for a film mammogram is $81 while a digital mammogram is $139.\n\nHis team evaluated more than 409,000 mammograms -- with and without computer-aided detection -- from more than 163,000 women aged 67 to 89. The study is published in the April 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nFenton took data from a large U.S. epidemiology database from 2001 to 2006. During that time, computer-aided detection use increased from 3.6 percent to 60.5 percent. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said.\n\n""In our study, we assessed its impact in the Medicare program,"" he said. The researchers compared the results when mammograms included CAD to when they did not.\n\nWhen computer-aided detection was used, doctors found a greater number of early cancers known as ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. ""But the [overall] rate of invasive breast cancer diagnosis was no different with or without CAD,"" Fenton said.\n\nHowever, among the women who did have invasive cancer, computer-aided detection was linked with a greater likelihood of finding the cancer while it was stage 1 or 2 compared to stage 3 or 4, they found.\n\n""CAD was also associated with increased diagnostic testing among women who turned out not to have breast cancer,"" he said. These women, because breast cancer was suspected, had to be called back for additional tests, such as repeat mammograms or biopsies.\n\nSo is the new computer technology worth it? ""Our study doesn\'t answer that question; it raises that question,"" Fenton said. The findings, he said, are a mix of potential good news and not so good. The additional tests that turn out to be unnecessary, because no cancer is found, are not desirable, he said.\n\nSome of the very early cancers diagnosed in older women, he noted, may not have caused them a problem during their lifetime. But doctors can\'t say with certainty which ones will progress and which ones will not.\n\n""Women should recognize that CAD comes with some potential risks,"" Fenton said. ""It has the potential risk of a false-positive mammogram. If you are an older woman, [there is] the risk of overtreatment of noninvasive lesions.""\n\nDr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations. He was not involved with the study.\n\n""The good news is the use of CAD was related to finding invasive cancers at smaller sizes and earlier stages than before the CAD era,"" said Kopans, also a member of the American College of Radiology\'s Breast Imaging Commission. ""There should be no argument that finding invasive cancers at a smaller size and earlier stage is beneficial,"" he said, as they are more likely to be cured.\n\nWhile he calls finding more DCIS with computer-aided detection also \'\'likely a good thing,"" he acknowledged the debate about the possibility that a very early cancer in an elderly woman may not cause a problem in her lifetime. Although the treatment of DCIS is debated among experts, Kopans said, ""In my mind, it is always worth it to find additional cancers.""\n\nOne limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference. Other factors could have played a role, such as the radiologists becoming more experienced, he said.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about mammography, visit the American College of Radiology/Radiological Society of North America.']",This story addressed most of our criteria. The ones it missed could have been easily addressed.,"This story summarizes the results of a study of 409,000 mammograms done with computer-aided detection (CAD) & without CAD among women aged 67-89.  The headline and most of the content of the story point out that CAD may not provide overall value.  Use of CAD did not improve the rate of detection of invasive breast cancer.  CAD use did lead to more false positives as well as an increase in further diagnostic imaging & biopsies.  The potential for over-diagnosis & over-treatment also increased because CAD detected more ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
We think the story should have added a line that this study does not answer questions about use of CAD in younger women.

This means that by taking an over-the-counter medication, people can ward off a disease that, according to Alzheimer\'s Disease International\'s World Alzheimer Report 2016, affects an estimated 47 million people worldwide, costs health care systems worldwide more than US$818 billion (1) per year and is the fifth leading cause of death in those aged 65 or older.\n\nThe Alzheimer\'s Association estimates that there are more than 5 million cases in the United States alone, with a new case being identified every 66 seconds. The annual cost to the country in 2017 is estimated have been $259 billion, with that figure predicted to potentially rise to $1.1 trillion by 2050. (2)\n\nDr. McGeer, who is President and CEO of Vancouver-based Aurin Biotech, and his wife, Dr. Edith McGeer, are among the most cited neuroscientists in the world. Their laboratory is world-renowned for their 30 years of work in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer\'s disease. A paper detailing Dr. McGeer\'s most recent discoveries were published Friday in the prestigious Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease. (Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease 62 (pp. 1219-1222).\n\nIn 2016, Dr. McGeer and his team announced that they had developed a simple saliva test that can diagnose Alzheimer\'s disease, as well as predict its future onset. The test is based on measuring the concentration of the peptide amyloid beta protein 42 (Abeta42) secreted in saliva. In most individuals, the rate of Abeta 42 production is almost exactly the same regardless of sex or age. However, if that rate of production is two to three times higher, those individuals are destined to develop Alzheimer\'s disease. That is because Abeta42 is a relatively insoluble material, and although it is made everywhere in the body, deposits of it occur only in the brain, causing neuroinflammation, which destroys neurons in the brains of people with Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\nContrary to the widely held belief that Abeta 42 is made only in the brain, Dr. McGeer\'s team demonstrated that the peptide is made in all organs of the body and is secreted in saliva from the submandibular gland. As a result, with as little as one teaspoon of saliva, it is possible to predict whether an individual is destined to develop Alzheimer\'s disease. This gives them an opportunity to begin taking early preventive measures such as consuming non-prescription non-steroidal drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen.\n\n""What we\'ve learned through our research is that people who are at risk of developing Alzheimer\'s exhibit the same elevated Abeta 42 levels as people who already have it; moreover, they exhibit those elevated levels throughout their lifetime so, theoretically, they could get tested anytime,"" says Dr. McGeer. ""Knowing that the prevalence of clinical Alzheimer\'s Disease commences at age 65, we recommend that people get tested ten years before, at age 55, when the onset of Alzheimer\'s would typically begin. If they exhibit elevated Abeta 42 levels then, that is the time to begin taking daily ibuprofen to ward off the disease.\n\n""Unfortunately, most clinical trials to date have focused on patients whose cognitive deficits are already mild to severe, and when the therapeutic opportunities in this late stage of the disease are minimal. Consequently, every therapeutic trial has failed to arrest the disease\'s progression. Our discovery is a game changer. We now have a simple test that can indicate if a person is fated to develop Alzheimer\'s disease long before it begins to develop. Individuals can prevent that from happening through a simple solution that requires no prescription or visit to a doctor. This is a true breakthrough since it points in a direction where AD can eventually be eliminated.""\n\n###\n\nAbout Aurin Biotech:\n\nAurin Biotech is a private, early stage Vancouver company which develops agents for the treatment of Alzheimer\'s disease and other chronic degenerative diseases. The company was founded in 2012 to advance the discoveries made by the McGeer and Associates Laboratory at the University of British Columbia (UBC). For more information, visit http://www. aurinbiotech. com\n\nABOUT THE JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMER\'S DISEASE']","The news release suggests that the way to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease early is by looking for elevated levels of Abeta42 in the saliva, thereby allowing early treatment with ibuprofen. However, no data on the accuracy of this screening method is included.","It’s unclear why there is a news release for this study published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease under the heading, “Conquering Alzheimer’s Disease by Self Treatment.”
There is no new research data in the paper. Four of the eight references in the paper — which reads more like an opinion piece — are from the primary author. The news release emphasizes his credentials and the huge medical and financial impact of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It focuses on the author’s previous work with using amyloid beta protein 42 (Abeta42) as a potential predictor of AD, as well as his theory that daily ibuprofen — “if started early enough” — may “prevent” the disease.
However, the news release doesn’t let readers know that — to date — there is no proven screening test to identify those who will develop the disease, no proven treatment, and no new data to support the hyperbolic language employed.

Nelson, M.D., Professor and Chair, Obstetrics and Gynecology at Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, Calif. ""Kyleena is highly effective at preventing pregnancy and may be an appropriate choice for women who want a low-dose, non-daily birth control method.""\n\nKyleena is a small, flexible plastic T-shaped device containing 19.5 mg of a progestin hormone called levonorgestrel. Kyleena is placed by a healthcare provider during an in-office visit and prevents pregnancy for up to five years, but may be removed by a healthcare provider at any time.\n\n""With the approval of Kyleena, women have an important new birth control option that provides pregnancy prevention for up to five years,"" said Dario Mirski, M.D., Senior Vice President and Head of Medical Affairs for the Americas, Bayer. ""Kyleena expands Bayer\'s IUD portfolio and is part of our commitment to provide women and their healthcare providers with a variety of contraceptive choices to meet their individual needs.""\n\nThe use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) has increased nearly five-fold in the last decade.3\n\nBecause Kyleena slowly releases levonorgestrel into a woman\'s uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter the blood. For the first 3 to 6 months, a woman\'s period may become irregular and the number of bleeding days may increase. Women may also have frequent spotting or light bleeding. Some women have heavy bleeding during this time. After using Kyleena for a while, the number of bleeding and spotting days is likely to lessen. For some women, periods will stop altogether. When Kyleena is removed, menstrual periods should return.\n\nAbout the Clinical Trial for Kyleena1\n\nThe contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. Of these, 40% (574) were nulliparous women, 870 (60%) women completed 3 years of the study, 707 (49%) elected to enroll in an extension phase up to a total of 5 years, and 550 (38%) completed 5 years of use. The trial was a multicenter, multi-national, randomized, open-label study conducted in 11 countries in Europe, Latin America, the U.S. and Canada. Women less than six weeks postpartum, with a history of ectopic pregnancy, with clinically significant ovarian cysts or with HIV or otherwise at high risk for sexually transmitted infections were excluded. A total of 563 (39%) were treated at U.S. sites and 889 (61%) were at non-U.S. sites. The racial demographics of enrolled women who received Kyleena was: Caucasian (80%), Black/African American (5.1%), Other (2.6%) and Asian (1.2%); 11% indicated Hispanic ethnicity. The clinical trial had no upper or lower weight or BMI limit. The weight range was 38 to 173 kg (mean weight: 68.7 kg) and mean BMI was 25.3 kg/m2 (range 15.2–57.6 kg/m2). Of Kyleena-treated women, 22% discontinued the study treatment due to an adverse reaction, 5.0% were lost to follow-up, 2.3% withdrew for unspecified reasons, 1.2% discontinued due to a protocol deviation, 0.9% discontinued due to pregnancy, and 20% discontinued due to other reasons.\n\nThe pregnancy rate calculated as the Pearl Index (PI) in women aged 18-35 years was the primary efficacy endpoint used to assess contraceptive reliability. The PI was calculated based on 28-day equivalent exposure cycles; evaluable cycles excluded those in which back-up contraception was used unless a pregnancy occurred in that cycle. The Year 1 PI was based on 2 pregnancies and the cumulative 5-year pregnancy rate was based on 13 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 7 days after Kyleena removal or expulsion.\n\nKyleena Clinical Trial Pearl Index Cumulative 5-Year\n\nKaplan Meier Rate Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Number of Evaluable 28-day Cycles of Exposure 16,207 13,853 11,610 8,556 7,087 57,313 Pregnancy Rate (95%\n\nConfidence Interval) 0.16 (0.02, 0.58) 0.38 (0.10, 0.96) 0.45 (0.12,1.15) 0.15 (0.00, 0.85) 0.37 (0.04, 1.33) 1.45 (0.82, 2.53)\n\nAbout 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥ 5% users) were vulvovaginitis (24%), ovarian cyst (22%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (21%), headache/migraine (15%), acne/seborrhea (15%), dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (10%), breast pain/breast discomfort (10%), and increased bleeding (8%). In the combined studies, 22% discontinued prematurely due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to discontinuation were increased bleeding (4.5%), abdominal pain/pelvic pain (4.2%), device expulsion (3.1%), acne/seborrhea (2.3%), and dysmenorrhea/uterine spasm (1.3%). In the clinical trials, serious adverse reactions occurring in more than a single subject included: ectopic pregnancy/ruptured ectopic pregnancy (10 subjects); pelvic inflammatory disease (6 subjects); missed abortion/incomplete spontaneous abortion/spontaneous abortion (4 subjects); ovarian cyst (3 subjects); abdominal pain (4 subjects); depression/affective disorder (4 subjects); and uterine perforation/embedded device (myometrial perforation) (3 subjects).\n\nIndication for Kyleena\n\nKyleena™ (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) is a hormone-releasing IUD that prevents pregnancy for up to 5 years.\n\nImportant Safety Information for Kyleena\n\nIf you have a pelvic infection, get infections easily, or have certain cancers, don\'t use Kyleena. Less than 1% of users get a serious pelvic infection called PID.\n\nIf you have persistent pelvic or stomach pain or if Kyleena comes out, tell your doctor. If Kyleena comes out, use back-up birth control. Kyleena may attach to or go through the uterus and cause other problems.\n\nPregnancy while using Kyleena is uncommon but can be life threatening and may result in loss of pregnancy or fertility.\n\nOvarian cysts may occur but usually disappear.\n\nBleeding and spotting may increase in the first 3 to 6 months and remain irregular. Periods over time usually become shorter, lighter, or may stop.\n\nKyleena does not protect against HIV or STDs.\n\nOnly you and your healthcare provider can decide if Kyleena is right for you.

However, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend a CA125 test plus vaginal ultrasound imaging for a woman with nonspecific symptoms that could signal ovarian cancer, such as bloating and pain. A CT or MRI scan may be added, although these are expensive. A biopsy is usually avoided because it could spread cancer cells.']","The story says new blood tests for ovarian cancer are being underused because experts fear that the tests could lead to unnecessary surgery or, on the other hand, delayed diagnosis. But we’re not told: What is the evidence for these concerns?","This is a story about the apparent underuse of two blood tests—ROMA and OVA1—that are FDA approved to help clinicians decide whether surgery to investigate abnormal growths should be performed by a gynecologic oncologist (“gyn-onc”) trained to remove malignant ovarian cancer, rather than an obstetrician-gynecologist or a general surgeon.
The gist of the story is that the tests have not been widely adopted in the ensuing years, “largely because they haven’t been recommended by the physician groups that write the care guidelines.”
The story hit on a lot of important notes–it told readers the cost of these tests, and it included comments from independent sources. What is not clear is the extent to which clinical evidence supports the increased use of the two tests. We’re told they accurately picked up about 90 percent of cancer cases. But we’re not told how that compares to standard methods of detection.

The drug, Addyi, or flibanserin , has been on the market since October.\n\n""The data presented in this review suggests that the meaningful change caused by flibanserin is minimal,"" according to the team of Dutch researchers.\n\nThe researchers looked at eight studies on Addyi that together included nearly 6,000 women. They said for women using the drug, the number of additional ""satisfying sexual events"" averaged out to about 0.5 per month.\n\nThe agency asked Sprout Pharmaceuticals, which makes Addyi, to do more studies on the interaction between Addyi and alcohol.\n\nThe researchers said the drug had significant known side effects, such as dizziness, sleepiness, and nausea.\n\nThe FDA approved Addyi last August with a ""black box warning"" to highlight the risks of severe low blood pressure and fainting when patients drink alcohol, take certain drugs, or have liver problems.\n\n\'I was amazed\'\n\nSome doctors and patients who\'ve been using Addyi say the drug has been helpful. There are no other FDA-approved treatments for women suffering from low sexual desire.\n\nDr. Lauren Streicher, medical director of the Center for Sexual Medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said the results cited in the Dutch study are averages, and while Addyi doesn\'t work for everyone, many of her patients have benefited from it.\n\nShe says she\'s written Addyi prescriptions for about 10 women, and three or four have emailed her back to say it\'s worked. ""They say, \'Oh my God, this has changed my life. Things are wonderful,\'"" Streicher said.\n\nJodi Cole, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mother from Porter, Oklahoma, said before she started taking Addyi, she didn\'t want to have sex with her husband, Matt. ""I love my husband and I believe God created emotional and sexual intimacy as key components of marriage. So we had sex, usually a couple of times a week. And while I was willing, part of me dreaded it. Every time,"" Cole wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nCole said she started taking Addyi in November, and within six weeks felt a difference. ""I was amazed,"" she wrote. ""I actually enjoyed being intimate and for the first time in a long time felt that connection with Matt.""\n\nShe said for her it wasn\'t about increasing the quantity of sex she was having, but rather the quality. ""What (Addyi) does is give just enough support so I can think about that part of our relationship with anticipation of pleasure rather than anxiety,"" she wrote. She understands Addyi can have side effects, but said women should be able to choose to take it just as men choose to take Viagra despite its side effects.\n\n""I should be able to choose whether the side effects are worth the benefit,"" she wrote.\n\nThe controversy over Addyi\n\nSeldom has one pill raised such controversy among medical professionals.\n\nDoctors who treat women with low libidos tore apart the JAMA study. Streicher, an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said the study drew ""erroneous conclusions.""\n\nThe International Society for the Study of Women\'s Sexual Health went even further, calling the study ""a great disservice to the millions of pre-menopausal women suffering from (hypoactive sexual desire disorder).""\n\nThe doctors had several problems with the study\'s methodology, including that three of the eight studies the Dutch researchers analyzed were not published. When studies are published, they go through a peer review process to assess whether the study methodology is sound.\n\nOne of those studies used a dosage of the drug that was half as high as what the FDA approved.\n\nDr. Loes Jasper, one of the authors of the Dutch analysis, said she and her colleagues removed the results from that study and still found that Addyi\'s affects were minimal.\n\nShe said she and her colleagues included the results of the unpublished studies because sometimes negative studies of a drug don\'t get published.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n""We included all published and unpublished studies to capture a complete overview of the benefits and risks of flibanserin, without bias,"" Jaspers wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nAccording to the FDA, which looked at three clinical trials of Addyi that included about 2,400 women, about 10% more patients treated with Addyi reported meaningful improvements in satisfying sexual events, sexual desire, or reduced distress compared to women taking a placebo.\n\nIn their editorial, Woloshine and Schwartz said Sprout and others put pressure on FDA to approve the drug.\n\n""While it is unclear how strongly politics influenced the decision, it is clear that the science was weak,"" they wrote. ""We all need a drug approval process that delivers good decisions based on adequate evidence.""']",This story doesn’t help readers discern between two forms of evidence that should carry vastly different amount of weight in readers’ minds. It also doesn’t alert readers to an expert source’s potential conflicts of interest.,"This story reports the results of a review of the new drug for female sexual dysfunction, flibanserin (Addyi). This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis studying the impact of flibanserin in women with HSDD. The CNN coverage of this large and exhaustive study had many shortcomings starting with the headline. It is hardly a ‘mixed’ review when you compare a weighty study that found very marginal effects of the drug in nearly 6,000 women, and put that up against a single compelling anecdote of a women who says her life was turned around by the drug. It’s also questionable to give so much weight to the comments of a clinician with known ties to pharmaceutical companies that make drugs for female sexual problems (and without disclosing those relationships).

The group, led by NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), tested 60 cerebral spinal fluid samples, including 12 from people with Parkinson’s disease, 17 from people with dementia with Lewy bodies, and 31 controls, including 16 of whom had Alzheimer’s disease. The test correctly excluded all the 31 controls and diagnosed both Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies with 93 percent accuracy.\n\nImportantly, test results were available within two days, compared to related assays that require up to 13 days. The group conducted the tests using Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC), an assay developed and refined over the past decade at NIAID’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories. Scientists from the University of California San Diego, University of Verona in Italy, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, and the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, collaborated on the project. The research findings were published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications.\n\nMultiple neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, involve the abnormal clumping of a protein called alpha-synuclein into brain deposits called Lewy bodies. The pathological processes in these diseases resembles prion diseases in mammal brains. Like prion diseases, Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies result in progressive deterioration of brain functions and, ultimately, death. Parkinson’s disease is about 1,000 times more common than prion diseases, affecting up to 1 million people in the United States, with 60,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Lewy body dementia affects an estimated 1.4 million people in the United States, according to the Lewy Body Dementia Association.\n\nEarly and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials. The diseases typically progress for years before symptoms appear, and once they do, distinguishing one disease from another can be difficult.\n\nThe NIAID group continues to adapt the RT-QuIC assay to detect additional types of neurological diseases with greater accuracy using the least invasive patient sample possible — whether that is blood, skin, nasal brushings, or other samples. The group also has trained many international colleagues to use and advance the test.\n\nArticle\n\nB Groveman et al.

While the researchers saw improvements in all participants who added some physical activity to their routine, those who got more exercise saw greater changes. The work is part of the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study.\n\n""These are people who want to live healthy, independent lives and are at risk for losing that. Maintaining functional independence for older adults is an important public health issue. In our first LIFE study, we confirmed that regular exercise can help improve physical function and prevent mobility loss. Now we see that small increases can have big impacts,"" said first and corresponding author Roger A. Fielding, senior scientist and director of the Nutrition, Exercise Physiology, and Sarcopenia Laboratory at the USDA HNRCA.\n\nFor the LIFE study, the researchers analyzed data from 1,635 men and women age 70-89 over an average of 2.6 years. Half were randomly assigned to a program of walking and walking-based strength, flexibility and balance training; half participated in health education workshops. All had low levels of physical functioning at the start and reported fewer than 20 minutes per week of regular physical activity in the month prior to starting the study. Participants were evaluated at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months. The researchers relied on movement monitors and self-reporting to measure physical activity outside study sessions.\n\nChanges in activity were significantly greater in the physical activity intervention group than the health education group from baseline through 24 months. There was a continuous, graded effect with the greatest benefits seen in the participants who engaged in at least 48 minutes of physical activity per week. The greater differences were also associated with prevention of major mobility loss.\n\n""Our goal was to have participants walking up to 150 minutes per week. To see benefits at 48 minutes is encouraging. We wanted the physical activity sessions to include exercise that participants could do outside of the study, and we hope that learning of these results might motivate others to try to make safe, incremental changes to their activity levels. Reducing muscle loss, functional decline, and loss of independence are important to anyone, at any age, and at any physical ability,"" said Fielding.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge limitations of this study, including examining the different quantities of exercise participation achieved in the LIFE study participants and not specifically prescribing different amounts of exercise to different study groups. In addition, there were differences in the measured absolute amounts of exercise performed when comparing objective activity monitoring using a wearable ""device"" and self-report of physical activity.\n\n###\n\nAdditional authors on this study are Jack M.

The release does a good job of describing the study methods and the conclusion that a modest increase of at least 48 minutes a week of moderately intense walking and walking-based strengthening exercises achieved significant, if not dramatic, decreases in average overall risk of major mobility disability over a two-year-plus period of time.
It also paid appropriate attention to the “dose-dependent” benefits of the exercise regimen as compared to the control group’s health education classes. That is, the greater the increase in minutes of exercise, the greater the benefits on average overall. It also noted the researchers’ conclusion that although 150 minutes of exercise a week was the goal, seeing benefits at just 48 minutes does have implications for exercise compliance rates and the likelihood that even elderly couch potatoes might devote 15 minutes or so a few days a week to stay healthier.
The release didn’t include any numbers summarizing and putting the results in context. It also would have been strengthened by including a more detailed description of what “sedentary” referred to. One notable inclusion was a paragraph devoted to weaknesses in the study. Bravo for that.

Among randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there was a statistically significant reduction in CHD risk in higher risk populations, including:\n\n16 percent in those with high triglycerides and 14 percent in those with high LDL cholesterol.\n\nA non-statistically significant 6 percent risk reduction among all populations in RCTs, a finding supported by a statistically significant 18 percent reduced risk of CHD among prospective cohort studies.\n\n""What makes this paper unique is that it looked at the effects of EPA and DHA on coronary heart disease specifically, which is an important nuance considering coronary heart disease accounts for half of all cardiovascular deaths in the U.S.,"" said Dr. Dominik Alexander, lead author and Principal Epidemiologist for EpidStat. ""The 6 percent reduced risk among RCTs, coupled with an 18 percent risk reduction in prospective cohort studies -- which tend to include more real-life dietary scenarios over longer periods -- tell a compelling story about the importance of EPA and DHA omega-3s for cardiovascular health.""\n\nAdditional study details include:\n\nThe study reviewed 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 16 prospective cohort studies, with 93,000 and 732,000 subjects, respectively.\n\nThe study examined outcomes such as myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and coronary death.\n\nThe study compared the results of RCTs, which explore interventions under strict clinical conditions, to those of prospective cohort studies that are observational, and followed larger populations for longer periods of time.\n\n""There are important public health implications related to reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, and therefore we are encouraged by the results of this comprehensive analysis,"" said Dr. Harry Rice, Vice President of Regulatory and Scientific Affairs for the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s (GOED), which funded the study. ""It\'s also important that the observed risk reductions were even stronger in patient populations with elevated triglycerides and LDL cholesterol levels, two risk factors that affect more than one quarter of the American population.""\n\n""The results confirm that increasing omega-3s is a healthy lifestyle intervention that can contribute towards reductions in CHD risk,"" added Adam Ismail, Executive Director of GOED. ""Remember that increasing omega-3 intakes is basically just improving the quality of one\'s diet slightly, like reducing the amount of sodium or increasing your dietary fiber. It is a simple, inexpensive, and achievable change that most consumers need to make to optimize their health.""\n\nAn accompanying editorial in Mayo Clinic Proceedings also acknowledges the importance of the study. ""The meta-analyses of Alexander and colleagues suggests that omega-3 fatty acid intake may reduce risk of adverse CHD events, especially among people with elevated levels of TGs or LDL-C....omega-3 fatty acid intake of at least 1 gram of EPA+DHA per day, either from seafood or supplementation (as recommended by the American Heart Association), continues to be a reasonable strategy,"" said the authors.\n\nStudy authors did point out that further clinical trials looking specifically at CHD outcomes may continue to provide a better understanding of the promising beneficial relationship between EPA/DHA and CHD risk.

But according to the meta-analysis, only 6 of 18 randomized controlled trials (RCT) studied patients with high triglycerides and only 5 of 14 RCTs looked at patients with high LDL cholesterol.","This news release summarizes a recent paper published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings that evaluated the effect two types of omega-3 fatty acids — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — had on reducing risk of coronary heart disease. The report was a meta-analysis, meaning researchers evaluated the findings of multiple published studies. Specifically, the meta-analysis looked at 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 16 prospective cohort studies. RCTs are designed to measure the effect of a specific intervention under clearly-defined, experimental conditions. This means that researchers aim to determine, with some degree of certainty, whether a specific intervention is causing a specific outcome. Prospective cohort studies follow large groups of people over extended periods of time, allowing researchers to determine what characteristics or behaviors may be associated with specific outcomes. Because of the nature of these cohort studies, they can only tell researchers if a behavior or practice is correlated with an outcome — but not whether the behavior is causing the outcome.
These sorts of meta-analyses can be extremely valuable tools for assessing a broad body of work on a given subject. However, this news release is problematic. It is written in a way that is confusing, if not misleading, and fails to make clear that the scientific-sounding organization that funded the study (and wrote the release) is an industry group that was created to promote the global use of omega-3 supplements or foods that are high in omega-3s.

But side effects, including dizziness and daytime sleepiness, were commonly reported by users.\n\nMichael Sweeney, MD, who is vice president of research and development for Serada manufacturer Depomed Inc., says the company’s slow-release gabapentin formulation avoids many of these side effects.\n\nAbout 60% of women who took the experimental drug in one study reported side effects, compared to about 50% of women taking placebo pills. About 8% and 18% of Serada users reported daytime sleepiness and dizziness, respectively, compared to about 3% and 8% of women who took a placebo.\n\n“These side effects, when they did occur, tended to occur early in treatment and disappear within a few weeks,” Sweeney says.\n\nResearchers presented findings from two studies of Serada at the NAMS meeting.\n\nIn one study, the number of daily hot flashes experienced by postmenopausal women taking 1,800 milligrams of the drug per day declined from around 10 to around 2. But a similar reduction in hot flashes was seen in women who took placebo pills instead of the slow-release gabapentin.\n\nIn the second study, about 65% of women taking Serada reported significant improvement in hot flash symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment, compared to 45% of women taking placebo.\n\nNAMS founder and former executive director Wulf Utian, MD, says Serada does not appear to be as effective as hormonal therapy, but it may be a useful alternative treatment for women who can’t take hormones or don’t want to.\n\nUtian is now an independent consultant and was a co-author of one of the studies.\n\n“Estrogen and estrogen-progestin drugs are about 95% effective for treating hot flashes,” he tells WebMD. “This drug was about 60% to 65% effective, which is about the same efficacy that has been reported with antidepressants [for treatment of hot flashes].”']","This story notes the preliminary nature of presentations at medical meetings, but it also leaves several key questions unanswered.", ,4,real

In other words, even if the dog had been given away for adoption just before the woman gave birth, the healthy microbiome exchange could still take place.\n\nThe study also showed that the immunity-boosting exchange occurred even in three birth scenarios known for reducing immunity, as shown in Kozyrskyj\'s previous work: C-section versus vaginal delivery, antibiotics during birth and lack of breastfeeding.\n\nWhat\'s more, Kozyrskyj\'s study suggested that the presence of pets in the house reduced the likelihood of the transmission of vaginal GBS (group B Strep) during birth, which causes pneumonia in newborns and is prevented by giving mothers antibiotics during delivery.\n\nIt\'s far too early to predict how this finding will play out in the future, but Kozyrskyj doesn\'t rule out the concept of a ""dog in a pill"" as a preventive tool for allergies and obesity.\n\n""It\'s not far-fetched that the pharmaceutical industry will try to create a supplement of these microbiomes, much like was done with probiotics,"" she said.\n\n###\n\nThe study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Allergy, Genes and Environment Network (AllerGen NCE), was published in the journal Microbiome, along with an editorial in Nature.']",This summary of pet ownership and allergies is mostly cautious about the observational research but more details on the study itself are needed.,"This news release from the University of Alberta reports that certain types of bacteria in the gut are more prevalent in people who have furry pets (in the study, 70 percent were dogs), and speculates that there may be an association between pets and the development of allergies and obesity.
Despite being short on details and explaining what the limitations are, the release is careful not to exaggerate the study findings. It says early on “don’t rush out and a adopt a furry pet just yet.”
The provocative theory whereby exposure to pet dogs in the womb or in the first three months of life can result in fewer allergies and even reduced incidence of obesity is far from proven. The release is clear about that. Still, we wish it had provided more details and numbers about what was studied and how many infant stool samples were taken.

According to the recently released 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, small shifts in food choices can make a big difference; including a shift from solid fats to oils, like the oil in fresh avocados. On the heels of this advice, a new meta-analysis (considered the best evidence and an unbiased overview of the body of knowledge on a specific topic), published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, adds to the growing body of research that supports the use of avocados in lieu of solid fats (and foods that have higher saturated fat content) to significantly change lipid profiles.\n\nThe research, ""Impact of avocado-enriched diets on plasma lipoproteins: A meta-analysis,"" conducted at the University of the Pacific and independently funded , looked at 10 unique avocado studies with 229 participants, assessing the impact of avocados on cholesterol levels. Researchers found avocado consumption (1 to 1.5 per day) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC), ""bad"" low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) when they were substituted for sources of saturated fat. Additionally, avocado consumption did not impact ""good"" high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). However, the optimal amount of avocado and frequency of use needs further evaluation along with the nutritional similarities and differences between other different MUFA sources. Larger trials looking at the impact of avocados on major adverse cardiovascular events are warranted. (See conclusion of study)\n\n""Interestingly, our results indicate that even healthy subjects with a relatively normal baseline TC (100 to 240 mg/dL), LDL-C (75 to 150 mg/dL), and TG (50 to 175 mg/dL) had significant reductions,"" says Sachin Shah, PharmD, corresponding author and expert in cardiovascular health.\n\nAs we head into American Heart Health Month (February) it\'s important to remind people that they have the power to help control their risk factors for developing heart disease by exercising regularly, knowing cholesterol levels and keeping them under control and maintaining a healthy weight.

The National Cancer Institute paid for the study.\n\nDoctors and patients alike find it easy to accept more cancer treatment on the basis of a study, Dr. Morrow said, but get scared when the data favor less treatment.\n\nThe new findings are part of a trend to move away from radical surgery for breast cancer. Rates of mastectomy , removal of the whole breast, began declining in the 1980s after studies found that for many patients, survival rates after lumpectomy and radiation were just as good as those after mastectomy.\n\nThe trend reflects an evolving understanding of breast cancer. In decades past, there was a belief that surgery could “get it all” — eradicate the cancer before it could spread to organs and bones. But research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, even when tumors are small, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery.\n\nThe modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors — because lumps big enough to detect may be too dense for drugs and radiation to destroy — and to use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places.\n\nBut doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. And until recently, they counted cancerous lymph nodes to gauge the severity of the disease and choose chemotherapy. But now the number is not so often used to determine drug treatment, doctors say. What matters more is whether the disease has reached any nodes at all. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. Chemotherapy is recommended, and the drugs are the same, no matter how many nodes are involved.\n\nThe new results do not apply to all patients, only to women whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe tumors were early, at clinical stage T1 or T2, meaning less than two inches across. Biopsies of one or two armpit nodes had found cancer, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during an exam, and the cancer had not spread anywhere else. The women had lumpectomies, and most also had radiation to the entire breast, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs, or both.\n\nThe study, at 115 medical centers, included 891 patients. Their median age was in the mid-50s, and they were followed for a median of 6.3 years.\n\nAfter the initial node biopsy , the women were assigned at random to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. In 27 percent of the women who had additional nodes removed, those nodes were cancerous. But over time, the two groups had no difference in survival: more than 90 percent survived at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1 percent. If breast cancer is going to recur under the arm, it tends to do so early, so the follow-up period was long enough, the researchers said.\n\nOne potential weakness in the study is that there was not complete follow-up information on 166 women, about equal numbers from each group. The researchers said that did not affect the results. A statistician who was not part of the study said the missing information should have been discussed further, but probably did not have an important impact.\n\nIt is not known whether the findings also apply to women who do not have radiation and chemotherapy, or to those who have only part of the breast irradiated. Nor is it known whether the findings could be applied to other types of cancer.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But taking out just one or a few nodes should be enough.\n\nDr. Armando E. Giuliano, the lead author of the study and the chief of surgical oncology at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at St. John’s Health Center in Santa Monica , Calif., said: “It shouldn’t come as a big surprise, but it will. It’s hard for us as surgeons and medical oncologists and radiation oncologists to accept that you don’t have to remove the nodes in the armpit.”\n\nDr. Grant W. Carlson, a professor of surgery at the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University , and the author of an editorial accompanying the study, said that by routinely taking out many nodes, “I have a feeling we’ve been doing a lot of harm.”\n\nIndeed, women in the study who had the nodes taken out were far more likely (70 percent versus 25 percent) to have complications like infections, abnormal sensations and fluid collecting in the armpit. They were also more likely to have lymphedema.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed.\n\n“The dogma is strong,” he said. “It’s a little frustrating.”\n\nEventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies.\n\nTwo other breast surgeons not involved with the study said they would take it seriously.\n\nDr. Elisa R. Port, the chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, said: “It’s a big deal in the world of breast cancer. It’s definitely practice-changing.”\n\nDr. Alison Estabrook, the chief of the comprehensive breast center at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt hospital in New York said surgeons had long been awaiting the results.\n\n“In the past, surgeons thought our role was to get out all the cancer,” Dr. Estabrook said. “Now he’s saying we don’t really have to do that.”\n\nBut both Dr. Estabrook and Dr. Port said they would still have to make judgment calls during surgery and remove lymph nodes that looked or felt suspicious.\n\nThe new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection. Surgeons developed a technique called sentinel node biopsy, in which they injected a dye into the breast and then removed just one or a few nodes that the dye reached first, on the theory that if the tumor was spreading, cancer cells would show up in those nodes. If there was no cancer, no more nodes were taken. But if there were cancer cells, the surgeon would cut out more nodes.\n\nAlthough the technique spared many women, many others with positive nodes still had extensive cutting in the armpit, and suffered from side effects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Women really dread the axillary dissection,” Dr. Giuliano said. “They fear lymphedema. There’s numbness, shoulder pain , and some have limitation of motion. There are a fair number of serious complications. Women know it.”\n\nAfter armpit surgery, 20 percent to 30 percent of women develop lymphedema, Dr. Port said, and radiation may increase the rate to 40 percent to 50 percent. Physical therapy can help, but there is no cure.\n\nThe complications — and the fact that there was no proof that removing the nodes prolonged survival — inspired Dr. Giuliano to compare women with and without axillary dissection. Some doctors objected. They were so sure cancerous nodes had to come out that they said the study was unethical and would endanger women.\n\n“Some prominent institutions wouldn’t even take part in it,” Dr. Giuliano said, though he declined to name them. “They’re very supportive now. We don’t want to hurt their feelings. They’ve seen the light.”""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This thoughtful, reasoned story walked readers carefully through the new findings on lymph node removal following a breast cancer diagnosis and also provided a great Q&amp;A with the reporter answering questions from readers that provided even more insights.  </span>","We do wish that the story had provided a few more hard numbers, especially in regard to cost.

This group of patients are expected to live less than six months.\n\nThe trial was led in the UK by Professor Kevin Harrington of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and involved 20 research organisations from around the world. It was funded by Bristol Myers Squibb.\n\nOf the 361 patients in the trial, 240 with relapsed or metastatic head and neck cancer were allocated to receive nivolumab and 121 to one of three different chemotherapies.

And cancer patients may experience low platelet counts and be at risk for a clotting disorder called \'heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.\'"" Dr. McBane noted that cancer and cancer treatment can be associated with kidney injury, which can limit the drug\'s use further.

In the analysis, those given solanezumab had a 34% reduction in memory loss and other mental symptoms compared with those on placebo. There was even a hint that the drug helped to slow the decline in functioning.\n\nAsked if the 34% improvement in cognitive decline is meaningful to a patient, Carrillo said, ""I have a family member with AD.

(True, ""Eat less and exercise more"" is great advice if you can manage to follow it, but public-health authorities have repeated that line until they\'re blue in the face and as a population we\'ve only gotten fatter.)\n\nResearch presented over the weekend at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society and published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests a few specific strategies that may help -- namely making a commercial weight-loss program, including packaged foods, free.\n\nIn the study, some 442 overweight or obese women were randomly assigned to the Jenny Craig weight-loss program with once-weekly face-to-face counseling sessions, to the same program with weekly phone counseling or to a control group that received ""usual care,"" i.e. publicly available materials on diet and exercise. The two groups using the program also got $25 payments for every 6-month clinic visit to assess weight and other measurements. Jenny Craig, a unit of Nestlé, funded the research.\n\nAfter two years, the in-person group had lost an average of 16.3 pounds, the phone group lost 13.6 pounds and the control group lost 4.4 pounds.\n\nIn the editorial accompanying the study, Rena Wing, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University\'s Warren Alpert Medical School, writes the results suggest that if commercial weight-loss programs such as Jenny Craig were free to those who want to lose weight, ""both retention and average weight loss outcomes might be far better than when participants must pay for these programs."" The program costs about $1,600 for 12 weeks, she writes. Compare that to the $19,000 to $29,000 cost of bariatric surgery, which is often reimbursed by insurers.\n\n(The countervailing theory is that people value things more when they pay for them, and that the mere act of ponying up $1,600 for three months of a diet program may make you take it more seriously.)\n\nWing calls for cost-effectiveness studies, conducted by researchers without any financial ties to the companies involved, that compare different commercial programs with each other. She also notes that more research on weight loss maintenance is needed, since the average weight loss was greater at one year than at the end of the study.\n\nFurther reading:']",This short (399 word) blog piece addresses many of our criteria but fell short in explaining the limitations of this research.  ,"This smartly written blog post manages to pack more information into a tight space than many longer pieces.

This is the first product in its class (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) approved to treat this type of cancer.\n\n""Tecentriq provides these patients with a new therapy targeting the PD-L1 pathway,"" said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA\'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""Products that block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are part of an evolving story about the relationship between the body\'s immune system and its interaction with cancer cells.""\n\nTecentriq targets the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (proteins found on the body\'s immune cells and some cancer cells). By blocking these interactions, Tecentriq may help the body\'s immune system fight cancer cells. Tecentriq is the first FDA-approved PD-L1 inhibitor and the latest in the broader class of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted biologics approved by the FDA in the last two years.\n\nTecentriq is approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease has worsened during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy, either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgical treatment. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer and occurs in the urinary tract system, involving the bladder and related organs. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 76,960 new cases of bladder cancer and 16,390 deaths from the disease in 2016.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Tecentriq were studied in a single-arm clinical trial involving 310 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). The study also looked at the difference in effect based on ""positive"" versus ""negative"" expression of the PD-L1 protein on patients\' tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In all patients, 14.8 percent of participants experienced at least a partial shrinkage of their tumors, an effect that lasted from more than 2.1 to more than 13.8 months at the time of the response analysis. In patients who were classified as ""positive"" for PD-L1 expression, 26 percent of participants experienced a tumor response (compared to 9.5 percent of participants who were classified as ""negative"" for PD-L1 expression).\n\nWhile patients who received Tecentriq experienced a tumor response across the study, the greater effect in those who were classified as ""positive"" for PD-L1 expression suggests that the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells may help identify patients who are more likely to respond to treatment with Tecentriq. Therefore, today the FDA also approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients\' tumor-infiltrating immune cells and help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with Tecentriq.\n\nThe most common side effects of treatment with Tencentriq were fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, urinary tract infection, fever (pyrexia) and constipation. Tencentriq also has the potential to cause infection and serious side effects that result from the immune system effect of Tencentriq (known as ""immune-mediated side effects""). These severe immune-mediated side effects involve healthy organs, including the lung, colon and endocrine system.\n\nThe FDA granted the Tecentriq application breakthrough therapy designation, priority review status and accelerated approval for this indication. These are distinct programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of certain new drugs in light of their potential to benefit patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.\n\nTecentriq is marketed by Genentech based in San Francisco, California. The Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay companion diagnostic for Tecentriq is marketed by Ventana Medical Systems, based in Tucson, Arizona.\n\nFor more information:\n\nFDA: Office of Hematology and Oncology Products\n\nFDA: Approved Drugs: Questions and Answers\n\nFDA: Companion Diagnostics\n\nNCI: Bladder Cancer\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

The drug, atezolizumab (marketed as Tecentriq), showed effectiveness in about 14 percent of 310 patients in a very preliminary study.
The release notes that the trial measured tumor shrinkage as the main outcome. It didn’t note, as a NYT article did, and important for this type of trial, that it is unknown whether the treatment makes a difference in survival. A larger study is being done to examine this. Whether it makes a difference in quality of life is also important and will presumably be examined in the larger trial.

Researchers monitored for mood and other side-effects after each treatment session.\n\nFollowing the RCT, participants also received 12 ketamine treatments in an open-label phase to investigate the effectiveness of multiple doses of ketamine.\n\nBy the six-month follow up, 43 percent of participants (7 of 14) who completed the RCT had remitted, with five remitting at amounts below the commonly-used dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Repeated treatments also resulted in a higher likelihood of remission or a longer time to relapse, with an overall response and remission rate of 68.8 percent for the patients receiving ketamine treatment.\n\n""Elderly patients with severe depression face additional barriers when seeking treatment for the condition. Many medications may cause more side effects or have lower efficacy as the brain ages,"" said co-author Dr Duncan George from UNSW Sydney. ""Older people are also more likely to have co-morbidities like neurodegenerative disorders and chronic pain, which can cause further complications due to ketamine\'s reported side effects. ""Our results indicate a dose-titration method may be particularly useful for older patients, as the best dose was selected for each individual person to maximise ketamine\'s benefits while minimising its adverse side effects.""\n\nPrevious studies into ketamine treatments for older people with depression - which are limited to just five case reports - show mixed success, with findings limited by small sample sizes.\n\nMore broadly, little is known about ketamine\'s potential side effects at different doses, which include cognitive and dissociative effects, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, liver inflammation and urinary problems.\n\n""These results are a promising early piece of the puzzle, but the risks of ketamine use are still not wholly understood. Future studies with greater sample sizes are needed to formally assess ketamine\'s side effects, such as its impact on liver function,"" Professor Loo added.\n\n###\n\nThe study was a collaboration between UNSW Sydney, Black Dog Institute, Royal North Shore Hospital, The Wesley Hospital Kogarah, the Dementia Collaborative Research Centre and the University of Otago.\n\nProfessor Loo will build on these promising results as part of her current work directing the world\'s largest trial of ketamine to treat depression, which is now recruiting participants. For more information about the study contact ket.study@unsw.edu.au or call 02 9382 9509.']","The study included only 16 patients, a limitation never directly addressed in the release.","This news release does a marginal job of describing what appears to be the first randomized, placebo controlled trial of the anesthetic agent ketamine for hard-to-treat depression in older adults. It offers a baffling, apparently incorrect account of the study findings and skimps on explaining what the alternatives are for treating depression in older adults. It could also have been greatly strengthened by noting the limitations of the study. Only 16 volunteers were enrolled and the study had only a 5-week controlled treatment period with a 6-month uncontrolled follow-up.
The release earns praise for its explanation of the complex protocol of the research, the limitations of previous studies in determining the value of ketamine and noting that there is still much to learn about the drug and its long-term effects and risks.
In the end, though, this release doesn’t leave us any more clued in about how ready for prime time clinical use ketamine is — or is not. And its headline is a good reminder of why “promising” is one of the 7 words you shouldn’t use in medical news.

In the studies detailed on Sunday, both drugs reduced the bad cholesterol by about 60 percent, to about 50 milligrams per deciliter from about 120 at the start of the studies. In many cases such big reductions were achieved even though the patients were already taking statins.\n\nBoth drugs could win approval from the Food and Drug Administration by this summer. Analysts say the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales and will be taken by millions of people who cannot lower their cholesterol enough using statins alone or cannot tolerate statins. (However, the PCSK9 drugs are taken by injection every two weeks or four weeks, which could deter some users.)\n\nStatins reduce cardiovascular risk and scientists believe it is because they decrease low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol. But merely looking at cholesterol levels can be misleading. The drug niacin did not protect against heart attacks and strokes even though it raised so-called good cholesterol and modestly lowered bad cholesterol.\n\nInsurers in particular might demand proof that the PCSK9 drugs stave off heart attacks, strokes, deaths from coronary disease and procedures to open arteries before agreeing to pay for them for many patients. Executives at CVS Health, a leading pharmacy benefits manager, recently said that PCSK9 inhibitors might cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year and would strain health care budgets because so many people might use them.\n\n“Managed care pharmacy, indeed the health care system, has never seen a challenge like this to our resilience in absorbing costs,” they wrote in the Health Affairs blog.\n\nWhether the results from these two small studies will be persuasive enough remains to be seen.\n\nThe study of Amgen’s evolocumab involved 4,465 patients with various degrees of risk, two-thirds of whom were randomly chosen to get the drug in addition to the medication they were already taking. After one year, 0.95 percent of those in the group that received the drug had suffered a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular problem, compared with 2.18 percent in the group that did not take the drug. By a measure known as the hazard ratio, the risk of cardiovascular events was reduced by 53 percent.']",This New York Times story did a thorough job explaining the benefits and shortcomings of a series of trials looking into a class of cholesterol drugs.

Noctiva is the first FDA-approved treatment for this condition.\n\n“Today’s approval provides adults who overproduce urine at night with the first FDA-approved therapeutic option to help reduce the number of times a night they wake up to urinate,” said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D., M.M.Sc., director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “It is important to know that Noctiva is not approved for all causes of night-time urination, so patients should discuss their symptoms with their health care provider who can determine the underlying cause of the night-time urination and whether Noctiva is right for them.”\n\nNocturia (wakening at night to urinate) is a symptom that can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, such as congestive heart failure, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, medications, or diseases of the bladder or prostate. Before considering Noctiva, health care providers should evaluate each patient for possible causes for the nocturia, and optimize the treatment of underlying conditions that may be contributing to the night-time urination. Because Noctiva is approved only for adults with nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria, health care providers should confirm overproduction of urine at night with a 24-hour urine collection, if one has not been obtained previously. Health care providers should also be mindful of underlying conditions that can cause nocturia, but that make treatment with Noctiva unsafe, such as excessive drinking of fluids or symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n\nNoctiva is taken daily, approximately 30 minutes before going to bed. It works by increasing the absorption of water through the kidneys, which leads to less urine production.\n\nNoctiva’s efficacy was established in two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 1,045 patients 50 years of age and older with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. Although these trials showed a small reduction in the average number of night-time urinations with Noctiva compared to placebo, more patients treated with Noctiva were able to at least halve their number of night-time urinations, and patients treated with Noctiva had more nights with one or fewer night-time urinations.\n\nNoctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest or death. Health care providers should make sure the patient’s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. The lower Noctiva dose is recommended as the starting dose for those who may be at risk for hyponatremia, such as the elderly. Noctiva should not be used in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, those who have illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, certain patients with kidney damage, and in those using certain medicines, known as loop diuretics or glucocorticoids.\n\nNoctiva should also not be used in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension because fluid retention can worsen these underlying conditions. Use of Noctiva should be discontinued temporarily in patients with certain nasal conditions such as colds or allergies until those conditions have resolved.\n\nNoctiva is also not recommended for the treatment of nocturia in pregnant women. Nocturia is usually related to normal changes in pregnancy that do not require treatment with Noctiva. Noctiva should not be used in children.\n\nThe most common side effects of Noctiva in clinical trials included nasal discomfort, cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis), nasal congestion, sneezing, high or increased blood pressure, back pain, nose bleeds, bronchitis and dizziness.\n\nAlthough there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.\n\nNoctiva is manufactured by Renaissance Lakewood, LLC for Milford, Pennsylvania-based Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The Agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###\n\nInquiries Media: Andrea Fischer 301-796-0393 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA\n\nRelated Information']",Placebo performed almost as well as the tested drug in 12-week trials that suggest a new use for an older drug.,"This news release heralds the FDA’s first approved treatment for adults who get up at least twice nightly to urinate due to a condition known as nocturnal polyuria, or overproduction of urine at night. The news release does a good job of cautioning that this treatment isn’t for everybody who suffers from frequent nighttime urination, but it falls short in describing the size of the benefit, which is a small improvement over a placebo. It also downplays the fact that this is an old drug — desmopressin — being adapted for a new use. While it’s good to see old drugs re-purposed in ways that might be beneficial for patients, the flip side is that companies typically use this as an opportunity to raise the price of the medication.

The study was conducted at the IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to take the decaffeinated green tea extract or placebo for one year. All subjects also underwent cognitive training during the 12-month trial.\n\nAfter one year of treatment, functional brain scans (fMRI) showed that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-treated subjects had improved neuronal connectivity in certain brain regions. Participants who took the green tea extract also scored significantly better on assessments of visual recognition memory, inhibitory control, and adaptive behavior compared with those who took the placebo.\n\n""It\'s an important trial,"" says Dr. Steven Hirsh, director of clinical research for Life Extension in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ""The findings are very noteworthy and support further study in randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and durations. It is very encouraging that this catechin, EGCG, from green tea extract, has the potential to benefit people with Down syndrome.""\n\nDown syndrome is a genetic condition that affects about 250,000 Americans. Individuals with Down syndrome have an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21.\n\nThe team of researchers, led by Dr. Rafael de la Torre, program director of IMIM Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute and study co-principal investigator, and Dr. Mara Dierssen, group leader at Center for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona, Spain, and study co-principal investigator, proposed that EGCG might have conferred these benefits by inhibiting an enzyme called DYRK1A, which has been implicated in Down syndrome and neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer disease.\n\nThe level of DYRK1A-positive cells is elevated in certain regions of Alzheimer disease patients\' brains, and is roughly 20-fold higher in the frontal cortex, compared to normal brains. DYRK1A is implicated in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (via tau hyperphosphorylation) and amyloid plaques, both of which are features of Alzheimer disease.\n\nTea catechins may also modulate the damaging effects of amyloid-beta. Several animal studies have found that EGCG and related compounds from tea suppress amyloid-beta-induced cognitive dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Other possible mechanisms by which EGCG may influence cognition include epigenetic regulation, restoration of mitochondrial function, and anti-oxidative functions.\n\nIn an earlier pilot study supported by Life Extension, Drs. de la Torre and Dierssen\'s team showed that three months of EGCG treatment improved symptoms in individuals with Down syndrome, and in mice with a Down-syndrome-like condition characterized by overexpression of DYRK1A.\n\n""We are excited that the benefits observed in the early pilot and preclinical research extended to this larger trial,"" says Luke G. Huber, ND, MBA, vice president of product innovation and scientific development at Life Extension. ""This new research adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests compounds in green tea, such as EGCG, may support cognitive health.""\n\nIn acknowledging the novelty of their findings and calling for more research, the Spanish research team noted that ""…this study is the first well-powered trial that shows improvement in adaptive behavior (functional academics) and brain-related changes in young adults with Down\'s syndrome. However, more research is needed to clarify the nature of the beneficial association between the EGCG and cognitive training intervention (ie, synergistic or additive).""\n\nReferences:\n\nde la Torre R, de Sola S, Hernandez G, et al.

For a news release provided by a company, the language used to describe its results is measured, with no touting of its products between the lines. The release is up-front about the company’s status as funder of the research and explains how the findings are novel. However, readers are given a somewhat bare bones description of the trial that uses vague wording and lacks numerical estimates of costs and benefits. We’re only told that participants in the therapy arm improved in “some measures” of cognition and behavior, while scoring “significantly better” on other assessments. There is no mention of the study’s limitations or the treatment’s adverse effects.
We also would have liked more context on Down syndrome, such as existing therapy options, including other drugs already on the market.

Researchers have announced that people who eat dried plums as part of a regular diet can reduce their risk for developing colon cancer.\n\nThis discovery was made by researchers at Texas A&M University and the University of North Carolina, and presented at the 2015 Experimental Biology conference in Boston.\n\n""Through our research, we were able to show that dried plums promote retention of beneficial bacteria throughout the colon, and by doing so they may reduce the risk of colon cancer,"" Nancy Turner, study author and professor in the nutrition and food science department of Texas A&M University, said in a press release.\n\nTurner and colleagues examined how dried plums\' antioxidants neutralized the type of changes that occur when cancerous cells damage the DNA. They found that when rats were fed a controlled diet of dried plums, two major phyla of bacteria in the gut – Bacteroidetes and Frimicutes – increased, without negatively impacting other areas of the colon.\n\nThey also observed that those who were on the dried plum diet showed reduced numbers of aberrant crypts, which are early signs of precancerous lesions considered to be a red flag for future cancer.\n\n""From this study we were able to conclude that dried plums did, in fact, appear to promote retention of beneficial microbiota and microbial metabolism throughout the colon, which was associated with a reduced incidence of precancerous lesions,"" Turner said in the release.\n\nThe researchers plan to conduct additional research in humans.']","This story, based entirely on a news release, suggests that the findings from a rat study are directly applicable to people. Our reviewers disagree.","Yet another miracle food to add to the list. This story excites the reader at the prospect of eating dried plums to reduce the risk of colon cancer. In a study on rats, researchers from Texas A&M University found that a diet consisting of dried plums promotes beneficial bacteria in the colon and reduces the development of precancerous lesions. But does a reduction in such lesions (not actual cancers) in a rat mean that a human eating more plums would have less risk of developing cancer? The story eagerly suggests that “people who eat dried plums as part of a regular diet can reduce their risk for developing colon cancer.” But we think that statement is totally inappropriate based on this animal study. In fact, human readers would be “plum” crazy to change their diet based on this research.

(The control group received educational materials.)
Another detail many stories missed: This research is unique because it enrolled low-income patients. Since the magnitude of benefit was lower in this study, it suggests that these treatment options may not be as effective as seen in previous studies that included mainly middle and higher income individuals.

People don\'t even like to say the word out loud.\n\nThe good news, we\'re told, is that there are many things we can do – or not do – in our adult lives to lower our risk of developing different types of cancer. Want to avoid lung cancer? Don\'t smoke. Want to lower your risk of skin cancer? Stay out of the sun, or utilize a proper sunscreen.\n\nBut a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer. They concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a 15% reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer.\n\nIt\'s important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. As is often the case, there are many additional factors at play.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. It has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections. As the study\'s authors point out, ""The mechanism(s) by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an STI [sexually transmitted infection] is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin, lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin.""\n\nThis tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream. Furthermore, ""The moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection."" Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment.\n\nWhy is this important? Infections are reported to cause almost 20% of cancers worldwide, either directly by infection, or indirectly via inflammation. Several STIs – such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HPV & HIV – have been found in the prostate.\n\nParticipants in the study were asked about their family’s medical history, which may increase a man’s risk of developing prostate cancer, and their PSA screening history, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition. Men were also asked to self-report their circumcision status, number of sexual partners, and their history of STIs.\n\nCircumcision was reported in 68.8% of the cases and 71.5% of the controls. Caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision (69%) than African American men (43%). For 91% who reported circumcision, the procedure was performed shortly after birth.\n\nA few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man\'s history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. A cursory review of the data suggests, for example, that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported. Male-to-male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in STIs, including HIV.\n\nThis gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported, though the numbers of circumcised vs. not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results.\n\nThe bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it\'s not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.']",An over-the-top headline and lead sentence set a poor tone for this story about circumcision and the risk of prostate cancer.,"But a semblance of balance was recovered in the body of the story, which pointed out some important caveats about the research. Why wait until the last sentence, though, to report on the bottom line impact of the study (which is that it will have no impact at all on medical practice)? Wouldn’t readers be better served seeing that info higher up? There is already evidence that circumcision reduces the risk for infections; the current report adds nothing to the decision-making process.

They usually smoke less, are more physically active and have a healthier diet,” the researcher wrote. “Even if we have controlled for many of those factors that are associated with a healthy behavior we cannot exclude the possibility that we might measure a healthy lifestyle via multivitamin use.”\n\nApproximately half of American adults report taking a multivitamin regularly.\n\nIn industrialized countries, Rautiainen and her team note in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, multivitamin use is widespread. While conventional wisdom holds that taking vitamins could help prevent heart disease, the researchers add, there’s actually little evidence to back up this claim.\n\nTo investigate the relationship between vitamin use and heart disease in women, Rautiainen and her team followed 31,671 women with no history of heart disease and 2,262 women who did have cardiovascular disease for about 10 years. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 at the study’s outset, and about 60 percent in each group used some type of dietary supplement.\n\nDuring the observed period, 932 heart attacks occurred among the women without heart disease, while 269 women with existing heart disease had heart attacks.\n\nAmong the women who initially had no heart disease and did not take any dietary supplements, 3.4 percent had heart attacks, compared to 2.6 percent of the women who took multivitamins plus other supplements; this translated to a 27 percent lower heart attack risk with vitamins. Among the women with heart disease, 13 percent of the non-supplement-users had heart attacks, compared to 14 percent of women who took multivitamins only, which wasn’t a statistically significant difference (meaning it could have been due to chance).\n\nFor the women without heart disease at the study’s outset, taking a multivitamin for less than five years reduced heart attack risk by 18 percent compared with non-users of supplements. Taking vitamins for 10 or more years cut risk by 41 percent.\n\nSimilar studies have been done in men, with some confirming the current findings and others contradicting them, Rautiainen said. She concluded: “The question of whether multivitamins are good for you still remains!”\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/bub56p The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, online September 22, 2010.']",This story would have benefited by taking the hint from the lead researchers quote that ,"This is a story reporting on the results of study that looked to see whether regular consumption of multivitamins had any impact on how likely it was that a woman would have a heart attack in the future.  The study found and the story reported that multivitamin use by women who already have heart disease did not appear to be associated with the likelihood they would have a heart attack.   On the other hand, multivitamin use by women who did not have heart disease appeared to be associated with lowered risk of having a heart attack. However, the claims about potential benefits in the headline and lead are undercut by an author of the study who is quoted at the end of the piece as saying it is really still an open question as to whether multivitamins have any benefit.  The story includes some statistics that are helpful, but also others that may confuse readers

Memory capacity begins to worsen, along with processing speed and the ability to form long-term memories. Finding a way to defer the onset of these issues becomes increasingly important as life expectancy gets longer and global populations age.\n\nThis study, conducted by researchers from Italy\'s University of L\'Aquila and Mars, Incorporated, reinforces the results of several recent cognitive studies--throwing more light on the important role diet plays in maintaining cognitive health. Dr. Giovambattista Desideri, lead author on the paper, said, ""The results of this study are encouraging--they support the idea that diet, and specifically a diet rich in cocoa flavanols, can play an important role in maintaining cognitive health as we age.""\n\nThis study was the second installment in a two-part investigation by this team into the effects cocoa flavanols have on the brain. The first study, published in the journal Hypertension in 2012, found cognitive and cardiometabolic benefits of habitual cocoa flavanol consumption in older adults who had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Despite these findings, the question of the benefits of cocoa flavanols on cognitive function among individuals without MCI remained uncertain.\n\nThis second study just published in the AJCN looked to address this question. Enrolling men and women aged 61-85 years with no evidence of cognitive dysfunction, the participants in this controlled, randomized, double-blind study were assigned to one of three flavanol groups, consuming a drink containing either high (993 mg), intermediate (520 mg) or low (48 mg) amounts of cocoa flavanols every day for eight weeks. The nutritionally matched drinks were specially prepared. The high- and intermediate-flavanol cocoa drinks were produced using Mars\' patented Cocoapro® process, while the low-flavanol drink was made with a highly processed, alkalized cocoa powder. Other than the inclusion of the test drink, normal diets and regular lifestyle were maintained throughout the study.\n\nAt the start of the study and again after eight weeks, cognitive function was assessed using a battery of tests that examined memory, retention, recall, as well as executive function. Among those individuals who regularly consumed either the high- or intermediate-flavanol drinks, there were significant improvements in overall cognitive function after only eight weeks. As cognitive function was normal for this aged population, this study shows that even cognitively healthy individuals can quickly benefit from the regular inclusion of cocoa flavanols in their diets.\n\nIn addition to evaluating cognitive function, the researchers also monitored insulin resistance, blood pressure and other metabolic markers. Excitingly, there was also evidence of improvements in these cardiometabolic outcomes. In the high- and intermediate-flavanol groups, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced and insulin resistance was significantly improved. In contrast, only a modest improvement in diastolic blood pressure was observed in the low-flavanol group, with no significant improvements in either systolic blood pressure or insulin resistance among the consumers of the low-flavanol drink.\n\nIt is not yet fully understood how cocoa flavanols bring about improvements in cognitive function, but the study\'s authors suggest that the improvements in insulin resistance and blood pressure could be revealing. ""Earlier studies suggest a central role for insulin resistance in brain aging,"" said Desideri. ""These results could therefore provide some insight into a possible mechanism of action for the cognitive improvements we have observed.""\n\nOver the past decade, there has been significant evidence indicating that consuming cocoa flavanols improves vascular function. Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, human health and nutrition director at Mars, Incorporated, and co-author on this latest study, said, ""Since the brain is a heavily vascularized tissue, we might also be looking at vascular improvements as underlying the observed improvements in cognitive function.""\n\nDr. Kwik-Uribe went on to speak about Mars\' flavanol research program that has spanned over two decades: ""The amount of research showing the beneficial effects of cocoa flavanol consumption is growing and Mars is proud to be a partner in important research like this that highlights the positive role cocoa flavanols may play in supporting healthy aging.""\n\nDr. Desideri and his team are already thinking about the next steps: ""It is clear from our latest research and other recent studies that cocoa flavanols have profound effects on the body, and specifically the brain,"" said Desideri. ""Now we\'d like to know how they work and how long the effects last. If these further studies confirm the findings that brain health can be improved by consuming dietary flavanols, it may have the potential to affect the daily lives of millions of people world-wide.""\n\nNote to Editors: This research trial was carried out with a special cocoa flavanol test product, designed to deliver a standardized amount of flavanols within a nutritionally suitable drink. This test product is currently not commercially available. Flavanol content of commercially available chocolate is variable and, given its macronutrient profile, it is not recommended as a health food.\n\nAbout Cocoa Flavanols\n\nFlavanols are a distinct group of naturally occurring compounds that can be found in a variety of foods such as tea and red wine. Cocoa flavanols refers to the group of bioactives found naturally in fresh cocoa beans. Cocoa is an especially rich source of flavanols and the type and mixture of flavanols and procyanidins found in cocoa is unique. Mars studies show cocoa flavanols have a range of proven health benefits, including improved circulation and cardiovascular health.

The site was developed with Sense About Science [3], a UK charity that that equips people to make sense of scientific and medical claims in public discussion.\n\n""The Ubble website allows anybody in the UK between forty and seventy years old to calculate their \'Ubble age\' and their risk of dying within the next five years compared to the general population, using a simple set of a dozen or so questions,"" says study co-author Professor Erik Ingelsson from Uppsala University, Sweden. ""This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing."" [4]\n\nTo create the score, Professor Ingelsson and Dr Andrea Ganna, from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, analysed data collected between 2006 and 2010 from nearly half a million adults aged between 40 and 70 years from the UK Biobank [5]. They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately.\n\nThe results allow researchers to compare the predictive ability of a large number of health-related risk factors which were formerly studied separately and using different populations, although the predictive ability of risk factors does not necessarily imply they are causally related to the risk of dying.\n\nFor example, the research shows that self-reported information, such as usual walking pace and illness and injuries in the past 2 years, is generally a stronger predictor of death and survival than biological measurements, such as pulse rate and blood pressure. Surprisingly, self-reported walking pace is a stronger predictor of death risk in both men and women than smoking habits and other lifestyle measurements.\n\nSelf-rated overall health [6] emerged as the single most powerful predictor of death in men, and previous cancer diagnosis the strongest predictor in women (see figure 1 of the Article). When excluding individuals with serious diseases or disorders, smoking habits were the strongest predictors of mortality from any cause (figure 3).\n\nUsing these findings, the researchers then developed an easy-to-calculate risk score for an individual\'s risk of dying in the next 5 years, based on the most predictive self-reported information, including 13 questions for men and 11 for women. The performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two Scottish centres which were not used to develop the score, and was found to have around 80% accuracy in men and women (table 2). UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score for the overall UK population.\n\nAccording to study co-author Dr Ganna, ""The fact that the score can be measured online in a brief questionnaire, without any need for lab tests or physical examination, is an exciting development. We hope that our score might eventually enable doctors to quickly and easily identify their highest risk patients, although more research will be needed to determine whether it can be used in this way in a clinical setting. Of course, the score has a degree of uncertainty and shouldn\'t be seen as a deterministic prediction. For most people, a high risk of dying in the next five years can be reduced by increased physical activity, smoking cessation, and a healthy diet."" [4]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Simon Thompson and Peter Willeit from the University of Cambridge in the UK say, ""One appealing aspect of the website is the representation of an individual\'s estimated 5 year mortality risk as what the authors call ""Ubble age"" (the age where the average risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individual); this concept is similar to that of heart age developed for communicating cardiovascular risk. Whether this will help individuals improve self-awareness of their health status, however, or only lead to so-called cyberchondria, is a moot point. Moreover, 5 year mortality is easier to predict than long-term morbidity, or quality of life and life expectancy, all of which are more important to individuals and to society.""\n\n###\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS:\n\nThis study was funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Swedish Research Council.\n\n[1] \'UbbLE\' stands for \'UK Longevity Explorer\'.\n\n[2] For preview login details for the Ubble website, please email daisy.barton@lancet.com.\n\n[3] See http://www. senseaboutscience. org for more information.\n\n[4] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.\n\n[5] UK Biobank http://www. ukbiobank. ac. uk/ recruited half a million people aged between 40 and 69 years in 2006-10 from across the country.

A few weeks ago it was the notorious death grip study, this time it’s a questionnaire that predicts your “Ubble age.”
The new test is based on Swedish researchers’ efforts to correlate an array of lifestyle and health factors with mortality in a massive epidemiological study of UK residents. They are making the test publicly available via an interactive website with the help of the UK organization Sense About Science, which tries to help citizens utilize scientific evidence in their daily lives.

While these tests are never as “simple” as they’re made out to be, we’re happy to note significant improvement in this most recent release compared with its predecessor. The current release does a pretty thorough job of explaining the study and quotes from an accompanying editorial to provide some perspective. The editorial notes that it’s not clear how individuals may react to such estimates of their death risk. Is this information motivating to people or not? And if it is motivating, is it healthy motivation that leads to actions that decrease future risk, or does it engender a sense of hopelessness that leads the person to take on even more unhealthy behaviors resulting in even higher risk? We applaud the release for calling attention to this important unanswered question. But we do wonder if more thought should have been given to the answer before trumpeting the results to the world and making the test freely accessible to everyone.

Notably, participants did not take any MS medications after receiving HDIT/HCT. Other studies have indicated that currently available MS drugs have lower success rates.\n\nThe trial, called HALT-MS, was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). The researchers published three-year results from the study in December 2014, and the final five-year results appear online Feb. 1 in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n“These extended findings suggest that one-time treatment with HDIT/HCT may be substantially more effective than long-term treatment with the best available medications for people with a certain type of MS,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “These encouraging results support the development of a large, randomized trial to directly compare HDIT/HCT to standard of care for this often-debilitating disease.”\n\nMS symptoms vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties, weakness, fatigue and chronic pain. The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting MS, which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flare-ups or relapses. Over years, the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form.\n\nIn HALT-MS, researchers tested the safety, efficacy and durability of HDIT/HCT in 24 volunteers aged 26 to 52 years with relapsing-remitting MS who, despite taking clinically available medications, experienced active inflammation, evidenced by frequent severe relapses, and worsened neurological disability.\n\nThe experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing disease-causing cells and resetting the immune system. During the procedure, doctors collect a participant’s blood-forming stem cells, give the participant high-dose chemotherapy to deplete the immune system, and return the participant’s own stem cells to rebuild the immune system. The treatment carries some risks, and many participants experienced the expected side effects of HDIT/HCT, such as infections. Three participants died during the study; none of the deaths were related to the study treatment.\n\nFive years after HDIT/HCT, most trial participants remained in remission, and their MS had stabilized. In addition, some participants showed improvements, such as recovery of mobility or other physical capabilities.\n\n“Although further evaluation of the benefits and risks of HDIT/HCT is needed, these five-year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long-term, sustained remissions of poor-prognosis relapsing-remitting MS,” said Richard Nash, M.D., of Colorado Blood Cancer Institute and Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Hospital. Dr. Nash served as principal investigator of the HALT-MS study.\n\n“If these findings are confirmed in larger studies, HDIT/HCT may become a potential therapeutic option for patients with active relapsing-remitting MS, particularly those who do not respond to existing therapies,” said Daniel Rotrosen, M.D., director of NIAID’s Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation.\n\nThis work was sponsored by NIAID, NIH, and conducted by the ITN under award number AI109565 and NIAID-funded statistical and clinical coordinating centers under award number AI117870. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for the Phase 2 study High-Dose Immunosuppression and Autologous Transplantation for Multiple Sclerosis (HALT-MS) is NCT00288626.\n\nNIAID conducts and supports research — at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide — to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses. News releases, fact sheets and other NIAID-related materials are available on the NIAID website.\n\nAbout the National Institutes of Health (NIH): NIH, the nation's medical research agency, includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic, clinical, and translational medical research, and is investigating the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases.

Known as HALT-MS, the phase 2 trial yielded a 69 percent remission rate, which researchers say supports the development of a large randomized trial to see how it stacks up against existing treatments.
That cautious statement — that the trial justifies the performance of a larger randomized clinical trial — is a positive of the release, since it tells readers the treatment is not yet ready. The release continues to use restraint throughout, and gives readers a good sense of the benefits, but it’s short on perspective. There’s no discussion of costs, availability, or the number of patients who might benefit, and some trial limitations were omitted. More clarity on researchers’ ties to industry was also warranted. An explanation of how this trial relates to similar research would have been helpful, as well. And while the findings were just published in the journal Neurology, they’re somewhat dated, having already been reported at a medical conference in June 2016.

It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nScientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).\n\nGenetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.\n\nThey also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.\n\nThe Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.\n\nThe Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.\n\nThey said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.\n\nThe research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: “Our discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention. We hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.\n\n“With further testing we may reveal specific plasma and urinary profiles – or ‘fingerprints’ – of compounds with damaging modifications. This may help us improve the diagnosis of ASD and point the way to new causes of ASD.”\n\nThe research has been published in the journal Molecular Autism.\n\n• Note added 27 February 2018: The UK autism research charity, Autistica, provided the following comment to the Guardian: “This is a small, early-stage study which may explain one biological difference in autism. At this stage, the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism. For example, we don’t know whether this technique can distinguish autism from ADHD, anxiety or other similar conditions. There have been many previous attempts to develop a biological test for autism. Still, the best way to diagnose autism is through clinical interview and observation, which takes into account the many features of autism.”']",Independent experts would have given this story important context.,"A small European study found increased biomarkers in the blood of 38 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when compared to 31 healthy children in the control group.
This story jumps the gun by implying the results suggest these biomarkers cannot only “detect autism in children” but also “could lead to earlier diagnosis.” This speculative language appears to come directly from the lead author of the study who’s also quoted as saying “we hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.”
What would have helped this story considerably would be interviewing sources not affiliated with the study to clarify the limitations of these biomarkers, explain how ASD is currently diagnosed, and provide some much-needed context about the novelty, availability, and clinical relevance of the biomarkers studied.

GTPS is the current term for what used to be called greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis. This study is the first to directly compare these two treatments for the syndrome.\n\nThe medical community once thought that a swollen hip bursa--a fluid-filled sac that acts as a gliding surface to reduce friction between moving tissues in this joint--was the source of this hip pain. This conclusion led to the use of steroid injections to the bursa to help decrease swelling and pain. However, evidence now indicates that injuries to the muscles and tendons around the hip are the actual cause of this pain, and that inflammation is often not involved, calling injecting the bursa with a steroid into question.\n\nGTPS is estimated to affect 10% to 25% of the general population. This kind of hip pain has been reported to be more common in women and in patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, Iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity. The study demonstrates that patients with GTPS can get similar results from dry needling as from a steroid injection.\n\n""Evidence for dry needling of the hip in lieu of steroid injection is in its infancy,"" acknowledges lead author Kindyle L. Brennan, PT, PhD, with Baylor Scott & White Health. However, ""this study suggests dry needling as an effective alternative to cortisone injection.""\n\nDr. Brennan adds that, ""The potential detrimental side effects of steroid injection, particularly repeated injections, are of concern for patients and providers alike."" As a result, ""the identification of a comparable treatment alternative with minimal side effects, such as dry needling, offers valuable clinical advantages,"" she says.\n\nDr. Brennan and her fellow researchers treated 43 patients with GPTS and a total of 50 painful hips. The patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group receiving cortisone injection and the other group, dry needling. Treatments were administered over six weeks, and clinical outcomes were collected at the start of the trial and at one, three, and six weeks. The researchers measured pain and function. They also collected information about medication intake for pain in the involved hip, as well as the sex, age, and body mass index of study participants.\n\nThe baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. The results showed that cortisone injection did not provide better outcomes than dry needling for either pain or function in patients with GTPS. Both groups experienced a decrease in pain and an improved ability to move and complete daily activities.\n\nDr. Brennan cautions that while this study uses a larger sample than most, further studies are warranted. In particular, participants were only followed for six weeks; additional studies over longer time periods will be important.\n\n###\n\nThe study is titled ""Dry Needling Versus Cortisone Injection in the Treatment of Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome: A Noninferiority Randomized Clinical Trial.""

It adds to a body of mixed research on some potential benefits of the popular omega-3 fatty acid known as DHA, or docosahexaenoic acid. DHA, which can move from the mother to the baby during pregnancy, accumulates in the brain and is thought to be involved in helping brain cells communicate.\n\nFish-oil supplements don\'t appear to help pregnant women prevent post-partum depression or boost the baby\'s brain development as previously believed. Above, fish oil tablets. Getty images\n\nA Fish Story Consuming fish oil, either from fresh fish or supplements, has some proven health benefits. But there is less scientific evidence that it is beneficial in other cases.

But ""it doesn\'t mean we should give up on fish or fish oil during pregnancy,"" she said.\n\nSeveral previous studies have shown that eating fish during pregnancy helped in the baby\'s brain development and in reducing the risk of post-partum depression. That research, however, typically didn\'t involve randomized, controlled studies. Instead, women were asked whether or not they chose to eat fish during pregnancy. It could be the case that eating fish is better than taking fish-oil supplements or that women who opt to eat fish are generally healthier and engage in other health-promoting behaviors, Dr. Oken said. The few trials conducted that separated participants, into a group taking fish-oil supplements and another that didn\'t, weren\'t well done, because the women often knew if they were getting the supplement, and in some cases there wasn\'t a comparison group at all, she said.\n\nThe latest study does suggest that some subgroups of women might benefit from fish-oil supplements. For instance, those with a history of clinical depression—and thus are at higher risk of post-partum depression—who took 800 milligrams of fish oil daily lowered their risk of getting depressed after the birth by about 4% compared with those who didn\'t take fish oil. However, the difference wasn\'t statistically significant because of the small number of women in the study who had been previously depressed, said Dr. Makrides, who is also a professor of human nutrition at the University of Adelaide.\n\nWomen in the fish-oil group had lower rates of pre-term births, particularly births earlier than 34 weeks of gestation. But, there was a trade-off: More women who took the supplement needed their labor to be induced or had caesarean sections because the babies stayed in the womb longer, said Dr. Makrides.\n\nAdditional research is needed to study the benefits of targeting DHA supplements to women with a history of depression or who previously had a premature baby, according to Dr. Makrides. However, all pregnant women should strive for balance and eat a variety of foods, including fish, she said.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are the fourth most common supplement after multivitamins, calcium and vitamin C, according to the Council for Responsible Nutrition, an industry trade group. Other health benefits have been attributed to omega-3s. Research suggests they lower triglyceride fat levels and are likely helpful in preventing heart disease, according to the National Institutes of Health. There is some evidence omega-3s also may help decrease blood pressure, improve thinking in kids with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, help with weight loss and reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Fish oil doesn\'t seem to help lower blood sugar for diabetics, however, and there isn\'t enough research to conclude effectiveness for conditions such as Alzheimer\'s disease, irregular heart beat and cancer, according to the NIH.\n\nWrite to Shirley S.

Fibroids may cause severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, and interfere with fertility in some women. Surgery is often the only way to treat painful, bleeding fibroids, but surgery too can sometimes compromise fertility.\n\nEnter EllaOne, a member of a new class of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators. As of now, EllaOne is used in Europe as a morning-after pill because it blocks the effects of key hormones -- namely progesterone -- involved in ovulation. It is effective for up to five days after unprotected sex. Although EllaOne is not available in the U.S., an FDA advisory panel recently voted that it should be. The new drug is manufactured by HRA Pharma, a European pharmaceutical company, which provided funding for the new study. The hormone progesterone also feeds uterine fibroids, so blocking its effects may help treat painful fibroids.']","The story reads like a promotion for EllaOne – exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids, failing to critically evalute the study and incompletely explaining the benefits and harms of the drug. It also minimizes the breadth of currently available options, leaving the reader with the impression that there are no good alternatives.","Fibroids are common and can cause bothersome symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and pressure in some women. However, they are also benign and deciding about how or whether to treatment them depends on how much a woman is bothered by her symptoms, feels about the pros and cons of different treatments, and whether she wishes to conserve her fertility.  There are many different safe and viable treatments available, ranging from medications to minimally invasive procedures to surgery. Women who make a fully-informed decision about treatment in conjunction with their doctor are likely to be satisfied with their treatment so long as their choice matches their goals and what’s important to them.
Even with so many options, it would be welcome news that a drug may not just treat the symptoms but actually might reduce the size of fibroids. A new study presented at this week’s European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology shows that EllaOne, currently available as an emergency contraceptive in Europe (but not in the US), may shrink fibroids and reduce symptoms relative to placebo. However, the results should be greeted cautiously. This was a small, short study and the full results have not been evaluated. More research is needed to confirm them and answer many outstanding questions.

Now, a small study published in the journal Gastroenterology suggests that taking a probiotic supplement may provide relief from both conditions.\n\nThe randomized, placebo-controlled trial shows a connection between probiotics and mood improvement in people with IBS and depression or anxiety, as well as changes in brain regions related to emotional processing. Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders.\n\nFor the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. They were followed for 10 weeks; half took a daily dose of the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum, and half took a placebo. The probiotics were manufactured and provided by Nestle, which also funded the study. (Nestle was not involved in collection, analysis or interpretation of study data.)\n\nAfter six weeks, twice as many people who took the probiotic had decreased depression scores compared to those who took the placebo: 64% versus 32%. Results were similar after 10 weeks, as well. When people in the study were given functional MRI scans, the researchers found that improved depression scores were associated with changes in activity of several brain areas involved in mood regulation.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThose changes in brain activity “support the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,” the authors wrote in their paper. While their data did not show significant independent changes in anxiety, constipation, diarrhea or pain, people who took the probiotic did report improvements in overall symptoms of IBS and in quality of life.\n\nOne explanation for the improved mood in the group taking probiotics could be that because their physical symptoms feel better, their mood gets better too. That’s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself.\n\nMORE: You Asked: Should I Take Probiotics?\n\n“We know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,” says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research. “It provides more scientific believability that something in the brain, at a very biological level, seems to be affected by this probiotic.”\n\nNo serious side effects related to the probiotic were reported, suggesting that such a supplement could be a safe way to treat both stomach- and mood-related symptoms. Studies have looked at various types of probiotics for IBS patients, the authors wrote, and a recent review found that bifidobacteria seemed to work better for gastrointestinal symptoms than another common probiotic, lactobacilli.\n\nSome experts believe that gut bacteria influence the brain (and vice versa) mainly through systemic inflammation. But in this study, the researchers found no difference in inflammatory markers between the probiotic and the placebo group. McIntyre points out that the bowel communicates with the brain through other pathways as well, including the metabolic and nervous systems.\n\nMORE: Should I Eat Olives?\n\nThe study’s findings need to be confirmed in larger independent trials, and McIntyre says he wouldn’t yet recommend taking a probiotic for symptoms associated with mental disorders like depression or anxiety. (Study co-author Premysl Bercik, associate professor of medicine at McMaster University, says the formula used in the new research isn’t commercially available, anyway.) “The evidence at this point is promising,” says McIntyre, “but it is not sufficient to justify recommending to patients as a viable treatment strategy.”\n\nBut McIntyre says the results are encouraging. “They seem credible to me, and they might hint that there are other mechanisms, besides just inflammation, linking the GI tract to the brain,” he says.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.']","However, we think the story would have been stronger if it had dug into the measured benefits a bit more: How were symptoms measured and by how much did they decrease?","Depression and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are both common conditions in the US. Consequently, so any treatment that can effectively manage both conditions is an attractive one. This story about a new study looking at probiotics for depression does a good job identifying the strengths and limitations of the research, such as the small patient size and short duration of the study.
Readers get additional insights about the meaning and implications of the findings from an independent expert who was not associated with the study. This is particularly helpful in this instance since the research was funded by Nestle, and readers may be more likely to interpret the results with skepticism.
However, we think the story would have been stronger if it had dug into the measured benefits a bit more: How were symptoms measured–and by how much did they decrease?

BIIB -0.13% announced some new data suggesting that its experimental Alzheimer’s drug slowed the progression of the disease, while researchers said a clinical trial of a Roche Holding AG compound indicated the therapy reduced the volume of a substance in the brains of patients that is believed to contribute to the disease.\n\nResults of these studies were presented Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Washington. The data are largely incremental but were still being watched keenly by investors, who are looking for signals of potential success after years of failed drug candidates in the Alzheimer’s space.\n\nThe drug-industry trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, recently released a report calculating that 123 experimental therapies for Alzheimer’s failed between 1998 and 2014 while only four drugs made it to market.\n\nLilly hopes solanezumab becomes the first marketed treatment to slow the worsening of the underlying disease. Current treatments for Alzheimer’s can alleviate symptoms but don’t slow underlying disease progression.\n\nJefferies & Co. analyst Jeffrey Holford estimates the Lilly drug could generate peak annual sales of more than $3 billion world-wide if it is approved for marketing by regulators. A leading theory in Alzheimer’s research is that the buildup of a sticky protein known as beta amyloid in the brain contributes to the disease. Lilly’s solanezumab is designed to bind to amyloid and clear it from the brain.\n\nBut the amyloid hypothesis hasn’t been proven in clinical trials. In two large clinical trials reported in 2012, solanezumab failed to significantly slow the decline of cognition and functional abilities among the overall population of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s, compared with a placebo. Other companies’ drugs targeting amyloid also have failed in trials.\n\nLilly scientists, however, said the drug appeared to slow cognitive decline in a subgroup: patients with a mild form of the disease. The company has continued developing the drug in mild Alzheimer’s patients.\n\nSince 2012, Lilly has continued to provide the drug to patients who received it in the earlier trials, and patients who originally received a placebo in those studies were allowed to switch over to solanezumab. On average, the placebo patients started solanezumab 18 months after the earlier patients.\n\nThe new results showed that the patients who started therapy earlier retained an advantage in cognition and daily function over those who started later, and that this difference persisted for two years.\n\nResearchers said such a finding is consistent with the hypothesis that solanezumab is modifying the underlying disease. Some patients receiving solanezumab experienced swelling in the brain and other adverse events, but researchers said the drug was generally well tolerated.\n\n“Here we have a safe antibody treatment, solanezumab, that appears to benefit mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia subjects,” said Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at the University of Southern California, who presented the results.\n\nEric Siemers, an Alzheimer’s researcher at Lilly, said the new clinical data increases his confidence in solanezumab but “we’ll find out if it works or not” when a separate, continuing study of the drug is completed by the end of 2016.\n\nIn March, Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., announced some results from an early-stage clinical trial that showed its drug, aducanumab, given to a very small group of participants with mild memory problems appeared to reduce the amount of amyloid in the brain. The treatment also appeared to slow down cognitive decline—particularly at the highest dose of 10 mg/kg—in these people.\n\nThe results impressed Wall Street and lifted the company’s stock to all-time highs. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimates annual sales of the Biogen drug could top $10 billion if it reaches the market. The March findings, however, didn’t include all doses of medication at the 12-month time point.\n\nAducanumab is an antibody that is thought to bind to sticky clumps of the protein amyloid in the brain and causes cells to digest away the plaque and reduce amyloid, said Alfred Sandrock, Biogen’s chief medical officer.\n\nOn Wednesday, researchers presented Biogen’s full one-year data of all four medication doses at one year of treatment, as well as more participants in the placebo arm of the study. The results were largely consistent with the March analyses.\n\n“I breathed a huge sigh of relief” after seeing the Biogen data, said Mark Schoenebaum, biotech and pharmaceuticals analyst at Evercore ISI.\n\nWith a Roche compound called gantenerumab, new results in a subset of participants of the biomarker and brain imaging data showed that the compound did appear to reduce amyloid plaque as hypothesized, nearly two years after the start of treatment.\n\nA trial of the therapy was discontinued in December 2014 after a preplanned look at the data in the middle of the study suggested the treatment wasn’t making an impact on cognition.\n\nThat means the compound appears to work the way it is theorized to, yet still didn’t appear to influence cognitive decline, raising questions about whether removing amyloid plaque yields a benefit on cognition.\n\nPhilip Scheltens, Director of the Alzheimer Center at the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, who presented the data to media, said the findings suggested the doses tested were too low to be effective.\n\nA researcher at Switzerland-based Roche announced Wednesday it is going to investigate a higher dose of the compound in an extension of the trial.\n\nResearchers at Axovant Sciences of Bermuda, whose drug candidate RVT-101 works on neurotransmitters in the brain, presented a new analysis of data from its previously reported clinical trial. These data, which included only the participants to finish the trial, were consistent with previously announced data, which included everyone who started the trial whether they dropped out or not.\n\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com and Shirley S. Wang at shirley.wang@wsj.com']","This business story checked some of our boxes, but fell short on the key criteria that we think readers needed in this discussion of new Alzheimer’s drugs.","The story looks at the status of two drugs that are being evaluated as treatments for delaying the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. One drug, solanezumab, has been in the news off and on for years. Early trials failed to show positive benefits for the drug, but now the manufacturer is poised to release findings that it says will show a benefit for patients with so-called “mild” Alzheimer’s. The second drug, aducanumab, was recently the subject of a small, early-stage clinical trial. Its manufacturer is poised to announce that the drug appears to slow cognitive decline. Both drugs are designed to lower levels of amyloid in the brain, which is thought by many scientists to play a causal role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. However, as the story itself notes, neither of the new findings tell us whether these drugs will actually work. A more definitive, large-scale study of solanezumab is not expected to report findings until late 2016 (at the earliest). And the wait for definitive results on aducanumab will be even longer.

The condition tends to develop with age and can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and heart failure.\n\nPatients in the study had minimally-invasive surgery that fixes the problem by inserting a replacement valve to send blood around the damaged valve while leaving it in place. This procedure, known as a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, is done by threading a catheter to the heart through a small incision in the chest or from the large artery in the groin - it doesn’t require cutting open the chest.\n\nAfterward, patients could walk significantly further in six-minute walking tests used to assess their functional capacity. On average, they added almost 42 meters (138 feet) to their performance before surgery.\n\nIn addition, patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and their ability to complete daily tasks after surgery.\n\nThe results offer fresh evidence that transcatheter aortic valve replacement can help ease symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue that limit the ability to handle physical exertion, said Dr. David Cohen, director of cardiovascular research at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n“These symptoms lead to reduced functional capacity (inability to perform physical exertion) and also impact a patient’s overall sense of wellbeing and quality of life,” Cohen, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.\n\n“By replacing the diseased aortic valve, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (and surgical valve replacement) reverses these effects and generally allows the patient to return to his or her ‘normal’ quality of life - limited only by the impact of other conditions that the patient may have,” Cohen said by email.\n\nOverall, the current analysis included 2,775 patients from a total of 20 previously published studies on outcomes for this type of surgery.\n\nParticipants were 82 years old, on average, and they were typically considered high-risk surgical patients due to either advanced age or other medical issues.\n\nThe smaller studies in the analysis ranged in size from 36 to 484 patients, and most of them followed patients for as long as six to 12 months after surgery.\n\nOne limitation of the current analysis is that many of these smaller studies were not controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how transcatheter aortic valve replacement might improve quality of life, lead study author Nicola Straiton of the University of Sydney and colleagues note in Age and Ageing. Straiton didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nPeople who don’t get this type of minimally invasive surgery may instead get a more invasive procedure that involves surgeons cutting open the chest to repair a damaged valve.\n\nSurgeons may also perform what’s known as angioplasty, which uses a catheter to insert a tiny balloon and inflate it to open the valve; sometimes surgeons will also insert a stent, or tiny wire mesh cage, to keep the artery propped open.\n\nResults of the current study reaffirm that a minimally-invasive procedure can be a viable option, even for elderly people who are high-risk surgical patients, said Dr. Samir Kapadia, a cardiovascular medicine researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n\n“Replacing the aortic valve improves functional capacity,” Kapadia, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an important minimally invasive treatment option for replacing the aortic valve that is narrowed.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2EMHTuH Age and Ageing, online January 25, 2018.']","The story skimmed over risks, but did take pains to point out limitations to the research.","This story reports a meta-analysis of 20 studies that measured functional and quality-of-life outcomes for patients who underwent a minimally-invasive procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, to fix a narrowing of the aortic valve.
The story spells out several study limitations and included multiple expert perspectives. But, it may have confused readers because in several places it used medical terminology that relates to blood vessel surgery, not heart valve surgery. And, by not discussing risks or costs of the surgery, the story could leave readers with the impression that the surgery is low-risk and cheaper than alternatives.

1295,story_reviews_01017,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/4232/,2011-08-18 04:00:00,Doctors screen for cervical cancer too often: study,"['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Most doctors opt for screening women for cervical cancer more often than guidelines suggest, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers based at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that many primary care doctors would bring women back for cancer screening annually — while recommendations generally call for a three-year wait after normal tests.\n\nThat means more costs to women and the healthcare system, as well as a risk of unnecessary treatment for false-positive test results — with very little additional cancer-catching benefit.\n\n“There’s really no advantage to annual screening compared to screening every two or three years,” lead author Katherine Roland told Reuters Health.\n\nGuidelines from the American Cancer Society and other organizations recommend that women age 30 and older are screened using Pap smears and tests for the human papillomavirus, or HPV.\n\nIf both tests are normal, those guidelines call for a three-year wait before the next screening. That’s because HPV — which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer — may take a decade to progress to that point.\n\n“No test is perfect,” said Philip Castle, an HPV expert at the American Society for Clinical Pathology in Chicago. But, he added, “a single negative HPV test is very good at ruling out disease.”\n\nEven when doctors use just a Pap test, Roland said, a woman who has had a few normal tests in a row can go two or three years before her next screening.\n\nFor the current study, she and her colleagues sent out questionnaires to a representative sample of about 600 office-based doctors and hospital departments around the country. They asked doctors and staff what tests they used for cervical cancer screening and presented them with three patient scenarios.\n\nIn those scenarios, a woman age 30 to 60 has had two consecutive normal Pap tests but no HPV tests; two normal Paps and a negative HPV test; or a negative HPV test but no recent Pap tests.\n\nIn all of those cases, guidelines recommend waiting three years before screening the patient again, the authors explain in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. But for each scenario, between 67 percent and 85 percent of doctors said they would bring the woman back in a year.\n\nAnd those extra tests aren’t harmless.\n\nRoland pointed to the extra costs women may incur to get childcare and make it to the doctor’s office — plus the costs to a strained healthcare system of ordering more tests.\n\nAnd any extra screening increases the chance of getting a “false positive” result on a test — meaning the test finds something that doesn’t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk “undue harm” from those procedures.\n\n“Some of it is, don’t go looking before you need to go looking because you’ll find stuff that you’d rather not find,” said Castle, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nResults from a survey of the same doctors have shown that many also give the HPV test alongside Pap smears to women under 30 — which is not recommended, because HPV is common in young women and often goes away on its own (see Reuters Health story of July 4, 2011.)\n\nCastle said there could be a few reasons that doctors opt to screen women more often than is recommended. First, they might not know about the guidelines. But women may also be used to annual testing and ask for it themselves.\n\nIn addition, Roland added, some doctors might be afraid of missing very early cervical cancer and getting sued if they screen less frequently.\n\nBut if doctors and hospitals want to rein in spending and limit unnecessary risks, that attitude has to change, researchers agreed.\n\n“We need to shift toward the wellness visit as opposed to, ‘You have to come in here every year for a Pap,’” Castle said.\n\nWomen should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added.\n\n“A woman should know what test is being used,” said Dr. Mona Saraiya, a co-author on the new study. “Often a provider just does the HPV test” without telling the patient. “A woman should say, ‘What screening tests are you doing on me?’”\n\nAnd if doctors want women to come back again next year, women should ask them why, Saraiya said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/qdt5M1 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, online August 18, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A lack of clarity may mislead readers about the screening recommendation – marring an otherwise high-scoring story on an important topic for women’s health. </span>","This story was generally clearly written and delivered an important reminder to women that screening too often isn’t harmless – and that there’s a reason for evidence-based screening guidelines.
Unfortunately, the story is confusing in a way that could mislead women about how often Pap smears are recommended. The story cites scenarios of TWO negative Pap smears and asks what the next step should be. “…a woman age 30 to 60 has had two consecutive normal Pap tests but no HPV tests; two normal Paps and a negative HPV test; or a negative HPV test but no recent Pap tests. In all of those cases, guidelines recommend waiting three years before screening the patient again..” But the standard recommendation is THREE negative Pap smears before moving to every 2-3 year screening. The study’s scenarios stipulated that a woman has “a current normal Pap smear result” in addition to the past history above. Readers could be misled, since the story implies that only 2 negative smears are needed (or a single negative HPV) before adopting less frequent testing.

It’s estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls.\n\nResearch indicates that ASD most likely develops in the womb and that a mother’s diet during pregnancy could have an influence. But results from previous studies have been inconsistent, suggesting that other unmeasured factors (confounding), such as a mother’s overall health and lifestyle, could also play a role.\n\nSo an international research team set out to assess whether nutrient supplementation during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of ASD, with and without intellectual disability.\n\nThey applied three analytical methods to a sample of 273,107 mother-child pairs living in Stockholm, Sweden. The sample was restricted to children who were 4 to 15 years of age by December 31 2011 and were born between 1996 and 2007.\n\nWomen reported their use of folic acid, iron, and multivitamin supplements at their first antenatal visit and cases of child ASD were identified from national registers.\n\nAfter adjusting for several potentially influencing factors in both mothers and children, the researchers found that multivitamin use, with or without additional iron and/or folic acid, was associated with a lower likelihood of child ASD with intellectual disability relative to mothers who did not use folic acid, iron, and multivitamins.\n\nThere was no consistent evidence that either iron or folic acid use were associated with a reduced risk of ASD.\n\nThe results of the various analyses seemed to be consistent with each other, say the authors, suggesting that the association between multivitamins and ASD might not be fully explained by confounding.\n\nThey point to several study limitations, such as the potential for confounding and difficulty assessing type, timing and dose of supplements. However strengths included the relatively large population-based sample size and the advanced analytical methods used to gauge the robustness of findings.\n\n“Together, the three analyses appear to point toward a potential inverse association between multivitamin use with ASD with intellectual disability,” say the authors.\n\nGiven the current understanding and strength of evidence supporting the importance of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy, “it is impossible to imagine that these results, on their own, should change current practice,” they write. However, they say these findings “raise questions that warrant investigation” and call for verification in randomised studies “before recommending a change to current practice.”\n\n[Ends]\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nResearch: Antenatal nutritional supplementation and autism spectrum disorders in the Stockholm youth cohort: population based cohort study\n\nJournal: The BMJ']",We liked the cautious tone of this news release but looked in vain for any numbers from the study. ,"This BMJ news release suggests that a new study found a correlation between multivitamin use and reduced incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We commend the release for noting that the study findings show a correlation, not causation, and for making a call for more research. However, the largest drawback of the release is that it doesn’t provide any actual data from the study.
The release did call out some limitations of the research but would have been even stronger had it mentioned some very obvious differences between the group of mothers-to-be that took multivitamins and the expectant mothers who did not take supplements. The multivitamin group is more educated, in a higher socioeconomic group, has fewer smokers, are of more normal weight, more were born in Sweden and more were experiencing their first pregnancy. The presence of a higher percentage of women with overweight in the no vitamin group suggests that there are other nutritional factors that are unknown and may influence or increase the risk of having a child with ASD.

She had her second baby at home in Elm, some 100 miles north of London, when she was 31.\n\nChildbirth at home is usually considered more risky than in the hospital for both mother and baby in high-risk or first-time pregnancies. And even with low-risk pregnancies, some expectant parents have no interest in giving birth at home, either because of limited pain relief options or reluctance to be too far from lifesaving medical care if it is needed.\n\nYet some expectant parents want to explore the option of home birth but feel it is an uphill battle to do so. “Women need to be respected more and supported in their choice,” says Ms. Stevens, who is trying to figure out a way to deliver her third child at home even though the local hospital no longer offers a home birth option.\n\nThis spring the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a U.K. advisory entity for the National Health Service often known as NICE, issued guidance stating that home births are safer than hospital births for women who are having their second or later child with a low-risk pregnancy.\n\nHeidi Pollard-Hermann, her husband Greg and 4-month-old Maia who was born at their Portland, Ore., home. Photo: PollardHermanns Family\n\nThe NICE statement is thought to be the first time a major health-care authority has asserted that home births may be superior to hospital births for these mothers, with no evidence of increased risk to the baby, according to Neel Shah, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School who wrote a recent commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine about the NICE guidelines.\n\n“What was so paradigm-shifting about the NICE guidelines, they emphasize the dangers of over-intervention,” says Dr. Shah. “That’s huge.”\n\nThe guidelines have prompted questions within the U.S. medical community about whether home births really are riskier than hospital births. Some are asking whether the U.S. approach to delivery could be improved using some of the strategies employed in the U.K. and elsewhere, including the Netherlands and parts of Canada.\n\nThe rate of pregnancy-related deaths among U.S. women has been increasing steadily for decades for reasons experts don’t understand—though the absolute numbers remain small. The numbers include deaths of women during their pregnancy or within one year of pregnancy termination. One factor could be the rise in chronic conditions like diabetes, which may put women at higher risk of complications while pregnant. A rise in the number of cesarean sections may be related but is unlikely to be the primary driver, experts say. Home births, which make up less than 1% of deliveries in the U.S., aren’t to blame, experts say.\n\nNeel Shah, a Harvard Medical School professor, calls the NICE guidelines from the U.K. ‘paradigm-shifting.’ Photo: Danielle Duffy/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\n\nMidwives generally attend home births while obstetricians attend hospital births. Medical interventions such as an epidural injection or a caesarean section typically are performed only in a hospital. Gas and other types of pain medication are sometimes given during home births.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has reached a different conclusion about home births. “We believe that a hospital or a birth-center is the safest place to undertake delivery,” Jeffrey Ecker, chairman of the obstetrics practice for the group, said in an interview. Birth centers are small health-care facilities, often led by midwives, which try to offer a more homelike environment for giving birth. Some are independent facilities while others are affiliated with or work alongside hospitals.\n\n“In part because of differences between health-care systems, we aren't yet ready to promote or recommend the option of home birth in the United States as they are in the United Kingdom,” Dr. Ecker said.\n\nMidwives in the U.K. tend to be employees of the national health-care system, and work with obstetricians to share patient records and make plans for care. And so if a patient has to be transferred from home to the hospital during childbirth, it is more likely to happen smoothly and without professional rivalry, says Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives in London.\n\n“One of the riskiest times for a woman isn't when things are going normally and she’s in her chosen place, but the point when she needs to transfer,” Ms. Warwick says. “Handover points are where things go wrong.”\n\nUnderpinning the updated NICE guidelines is a large U.K. study called Birthplace, which studied more than 64,000 women who gave birth between April 2008 and 2010. Initial results, published in 2011 in the journal BMJ, indicated that among low-risk women who chose to have a second or later child at home, there were fewer interventions and complications, such as cesarean sections, forceps delivery, infections and hemorrhage compared with hospital births, while the health of babies didn’t differ.\n\nAmong women having their first babies at home, however, the outcomes for women were better but the babies had a statistically significant increase in risks of experiencing a complication. The absolute risk of something happening was very small.\n\nA large Canadian study of nearly 8,000 home births in British Columbia between 2000 and 2004 compared them to matched cases of hospital births and found results similar to the U.K. results, says Michael Klein, an emeritus professor of family practice and pediatrics at the University of British Columbia, and an author on the paper.\n\nMany clinicians focus on relative risk (the difference between two outcomes) rather than absolute risk (how likely an event is actually to occur). Relative risk can make a problem seem greater than its actual impact in the population, says Eugene Declercq, a professor of community health sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health. One might state a certain outcome is twice as likely as another, yet it occurs at a rate of 2 in 1,000 versus 1 in 1,000.\n\nSome NICE recommendations could be more readily adopted in the U.S., said Dr. Ecker, who also is a high-risk obstetrician and professor at Harvard Medical School. These points include establishing more birth centers alongside hospitals, using more midwifery care in low-risk deliveries and placing appropriate limitations on technology in labor and delivery.\n\nHeidi Pollard-Hermann, a 32-year-old labor and delivery nurse in Portland, Ore., chose to have her daughter at home four months ago. Ms. Pollard-Hermann says she wanted to avoid a caesarean section and knew that the chance of intervention would be higher at the hospital. She also wanted to experience labor. Because there was a major hospital 10 minutes away by car, she felt sure she would be able to make the transfer if problems arose.\n\nWith recommendations from friends, she found an experienced certified nurse midwife who had a relationship with a local hospital. “Sometimes there’s a lot of fear of birth in our culture,” says Ms. Pollard-Hermann. Labor, she says, “was amazing.” She gave birth to a healthy baby girl.\n\nWrite to Shirley S. Wang at shirley.wang@wsj.com""]",Our main suggestion for this otherwise strong story is to quantify the difference in risk seen between hospital and home births.,"The story looks at guidance from the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) — and related research — to pregnant women. Specifically, the guidance says home births pose fewer risks than hospital births for woman with low-risk pregnancies who are not having their first child. The story features plenty of expert views on both sides of this issue and is well-reported overall. However, it does little to explain the difference in risk between home and hospital births to readers — and it never defines what constitutes a “low-risk” pregnancy in this context.

And for some women, those injections could even be downright dangerous.\n\nAlthough IVF is still considered the gold standard, there’s an infertility treatment available that is offering hope — in vitro maturation (IVM). IVM has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones.\n\nWhat is IVM?\n\nIVM is an experimental fertility treatment that collects and matures a woman’s eggs in a lab. Although the treatment is used in conjunction with IVF, the initial process isn’t the same.\n\nWith IVF, a woman must undergo between 8 to 11 nights of ovary-stimulating hormone injections before her eggs can be retrieved. With IVM, women undergo a shorter course— between 3 and 6 days— of hormones known as a “priming phase.”\n\nOnce the eggs are retrieved, they’re matured in a laboratory for approximately three days, fertilized and then implanted. They can also be frozen as eggs or embryos to be implanted later.\n\nClinics that specialize in IVM require a doctor who has expertise in retrieving small eggs and a lab with embryologists who have the skills to look for them, said Dr. Janelle Luk, medical director of Neway Fertility in New York City.\n\nWho is IVM helpful for?\n\nAlthough IVF is considered the standard of care, experts say some women may benefit from IVM.\n\nFor starters, since there is less time involved with IVM, women who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates.\n\nIVM may also help women who have a contraindication to the increased levels of estradiol, a form of estrogen, which elevates as the follicles develop and mature. These would include women with an estrogen-sensitive cancer or a history of blood clots.\n\nIVM can also help women who are adverse to injections or who have failed IVF, Luk said.\n\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or who are at increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)— which affects between 3 and 6 percent of women who go through IVF— may also benefit from IVM. OHSS can usually be managed on an outpatient basis but severe OHSS may lead to blood clots, even death, said Dr. Shefali Shastri, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and OB/GYN at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey in Somerset and Short Hills.\n\nMore on this... What is ICSI infertility treatment?\n\nWhat are the limitations of IVM?\n\nA study in the journal Facts, Views and Vision found that IVM achieved up to a 35 percent clinical pregnancy rate in young women, which is comparable to IVF.\n\nYet most studies have found that IVF is superior to IVM.\n\nAlthough there are different protocols for IVF, and there aren’t any randomized controlled trials that have compared IVF and IVM side by side, studies that look at standard IVF cycles show a significantly higher pregnancy rate than IVM, Shastri said.\n\nPlus, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) committee opinion on IVM states that implantation rates for IVM—between 5.5 and 21.6 percent— are a more reliable indicator of IVM success and are lower than expected for women of the same age who use IVF. They also note that the technology hasn’t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays.\n\nSince IVM results in lower fertilization rates, protocols that use IVM are more likely to also use intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which one sperm is injected into one egg. Although ICSI is safe and effective, the bigger concern is if a patient going through IVM doesn’t use ICSI, Shastri said.\n\nWhile IVM is cheaper initially because there are fewer hormones to take, it may be more costly if several rounds are required.\n\nAlthough IVM may eventually become more common, IVF still remains the standard of care and the most effective way for women to get pregnant.\n\n“With medicine, you always want to optimize a patient’s outcome,” Shastri said. “Ultimately, you want to do the best for the patient so my preference would not be IVM.”']","While this story includes much useful information, its questionable timing makes it come across as a bit of an “ad” for private-practice, commercial fertility clinics that offer this service.","This Fox News article describes an experimental fertility treatment called in vitro maturation (IVM) that modifies the “gold standard” IVF (in vitro fertilization) for use in a subset of women for whom the IVF regimen is not an option. The article is less a “news” story than a “Q and A,” and it does a pretty good job overall of making clear that IVM is not for everyone and that controlled clinical trials have not been done to scientifically compare it to IVF in terms of success rates and fetal outcomes. Apart from the lack of critical information about comparative costs and risks of IVF and IVM or other forms of fertility treatments, the article avoids disorder mongering and readers/viewers will come away with a reasonable understanding of IVM’s limitations and uses.
What is a bit problematic, perhaps, is why the article is appearing now. 
There are, for example, no recent or new data or studies cited; the latest one this article appears to refer to is from a 2014 article by a group at the Technion in Israel. The procedure has been around for about a decade. So the article comes across as a bit of an “ad” for private-practice, commercial fertility clinics that offer IVM. One of the experts cited in the article is from such a clinic, in New York, which has historically issued news releases about IVM, including one noting it was the site of the first successful IVM procedures in New York.
As a public service, the article is informative, but for those with infertility problems, it’s unlikely to be telling them anything new, but instead reminding them that clinics offer the service.

Patients in the trial, whose blood sugar levels have remained near normal for five to eight years, take about one-third less insulin than they did before, reducing their risk of hypoglycemia, in which insulin lowers blood sugar to dangerously low levels.\n\nThe experimental treatment, a decades-old generic vaccine for tuberculosis called bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), seems to alter both cellular metabolism and the immune system, said Dr. Denise Faustman of Massachusetts General Hospital, senior author of the study published Thursday in npj Vaccines. “This cheap, old vaccine is lowering blood sugar to levels never achieved before,” she said.\n\nWhile the results, from only nine patients, must be replicated in a larger study, said Dr. Joseph Bellanti of Georgetown University Medical Center, “if what they found is true, they really have something here.” Bellanti, who was not involved in the research, said the study’s eight-year follow-up and use of a placebo control arm made him “cautiously optimistic” that two doses of the BCG vaccine “can decrease levels of A1c,” a measure of blood glucose that predicts the likelihood of serious complications such as stroke and kidney failure.\n\nadvertisement\n\nJDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), the Joslin Diabetes Center, and several university diabetes centers all declined to speak about Faustman’s results. She has been a voice in the diabetes wilderness for nearly two decades, angering the establishment diabetes community by pursuing low-tech research very different from more popular approaches, such as embryonic stem cells and immunosupression.\n\nCritics have gone so far as to send letters to newspapers that covered her work apologizing to patients “on behalf of Dr. Faustman” for “having their expectations cruelly raised.” She has also struggled for funding, receiving much of her research support from the private Iacocca Family Foundation, rather than in federal grants.\n\nIn Faustman’s Phase 1 clinical trial, three participants with type 1 diabetes received two doses of BCG vaccine, a month apart. After the vaccine showed signs of effectiveness, an additional six patients were vaccinated five years ago, and 111 more recently. The new paper and a presentation scheduled for a meeting of the American Diabetes Association this weekend focus on the patients who have been followed for more than five years.\n\nAll of those patients who received BCG had a statistically significant change in hemoglobin A1c. A normal level is below 6. In the vaccinated patients, A1c levels fell from an average of 7.36 before the first dose to 6.18 after five years, holding almost steady at 6.65 in the eighth year. In patients receiving a sham injection, levels showed almost no change from their initial levels of 7.10: 7.07 in the fifth year and 7.22 in the eighth.\n\n“We wanted it to be good, but we didn’t know it would be this good,” Faustman said.\n\nAll of the patients remain on insulin, she said, but less of it. They are also able to monitor their blood sugar less frequently, which can be several times an hour. (The standard of care is a continuous glucose monitor, in which a probe is inserted into the abdomen, plus an insulin pump.) “If we can gradually move people to where they can control their blood sugar, their minute-to-minute lifestyle can improve dramatically,” Faustman said.\n\nThe A1c reductions could also bring significant health benefits. Every 10 percent drop, research shows, reduces complications such as stroke and heart attack by about one-third. The BCG vaccine lowered A1c levels 9 percent to 16 percent.\n\nThe new paper describes how the BCG vaccine, which has been used for nearly 100 years against tuberculosis and is considered extremely safe, might affect diabetes. According to studies in mice, it has two effects. It alters the immune system so as to increase levels of T regulatory cells; T regs keep other immune cells in check, including those that attack the pancreas’s insulin-making cells — the root cause of type 1 diabetes. In addition, BCG alters metabolism so cells consume higher levels of glucose, drawing more of it out of the blood, in a process called aerobic glycolysis.\n\n“The clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system,” said Dr. Mihai Netea of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.\n\nA Phase 2 clinical trial of BCG is currently underway at Mass. General. It is testing multiple BCG doses in 150 patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes.\n\nAlthough many studies of BCG are underway around the world in diabetes and other autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, there has been little interest among U.S. researchers outside Faustman’s lab.\n\n“There is not a lot of enthusiasm because we’re all rewarded for discovering for-profit drugs,” she said. “Potential funders come [to my lab] and ask, ‘How can we make money off this?’”\n\nBCG, whose one licensed manufacturer in the U.S. is Merck subsidiary Organon Teknika, costs less than a dollar a dose. (Faustman used a strain made by Sanofi (SNY).) The U.S. market for insulin meters and insulin pumps is $20 billion. “With everyone thinking they need a pump and a meter, if you come along with an inexpensive vaccine that can change this standard of care, of course there will be pushback,” Faustman said.']",But it could have gone further sourcing the story and exploring the ‘controversial’ claim made by the headline.,"This story from STAT met most of our criteria in describing the results of a study that examined how two doses of the generic bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine, used for nearly a century against tuberculosis, affected blood sugar levels Type 1 diabetics. We were especially glad to see the results given in absolute numbers and that it emphasized how small the study was.
However, we did want to note that we think the story didn’t provide enough evidence to back the researcher’s claim that her research hasn’t been given much attention because she is pursuing a “low-tech” diabetes treatment with little potential for generating profit. This may well be true, but we should have heard from more sources other than the researcher and received more historical context to support the claim. We also urge caution around the use of “controversial” to describe medical science.
Note: We also reviewed a news release on this research, which focuses on a larger group of 52 patients who haven’t been followed as long as the 9 subjects reported on here.

Much like ,"The biggest strike against this report of a test of a new type of drug to lower LDL “bad” cholesterol is that it fails to make clear that simply lowering LDL does not always prevent adverse health outcomes (heart attacks, strokes). While the story does point out that this test included only people with a rare genetic mutation, many readers might still miss the point that the results may not mean anything to the average heart disease patient. The relevance of the story is also limited by the predicted high cost of a drug like this (at least $10,000/year according to some analysts), an important bit of context the story leaves out. Readers also aren’t told that Amgen funded the trial and the researchers were employees or receive money from Amgen for consulting and other services.

The results, published in the June 23, 2017, online edition of The Laryngoscope, may transform how doctors approach cochlear implant procedures to give patients the best possible outcomes.\n\nCochlear implants help preserve hearing in patients with nerve deafness who cannot benefit from hearing aids. They are surgically placed in the inner ear to convert sound waves into electrical signals that stimulate the auditory nerve to provide hearing.\n\n""This is the largest clinical study done in the world on conventional electrodes and will have major implications for doctors and their patients who need their long-term hearing restored,"" said the study\'s lead investigator, George Wanna, MD, Site Chair, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai (NYEE) and Mount Sinai Beth Israel; Chief, Division of Otology-Neurotology and Director of the Center for Hearing and Balance and Ear Institute at Mount Sinai Health System. ""This study is a breakthrough for patients with hearing loss, and improvements in practice and techniques will allow them to enjoy many hearing benefits such as music enjoyment, listening in complex environments, and sound localization.""\n\nDr. Wanna and a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University examined roughly 230 patients with every type of cochlear implant, including three FDA-approved implants that use different types of electrodes to stimulate the auditory nerve. They found that electrodes designed with no wire (called lateral wall electrodes) performed the best in maintaining residual hearing in the inner ear, compared to electrodes made with wire. More specifically, the non-wire electrodes were less traumatic, causing less injury and minimizing fractures inside the inner ear. The study found that the actual brand of the electrode did not make a difference; the presence or absence of wire was the only distinguishing factor.\n\nDr. Wanna and the researchers also looked at the impact of two major surgical approaches used to insert the electrodes in the inner ear: ""round window"" (where surgeons open the membrane without bone removal or drilling in the inner ear) and ""cochleostomy"" (which requires drilling into the bone to get inside the inner ear). They reported that patients who had the round window approach had a much better chance of keeping their residual hearing in the long term.\n\n""The cochleostomy approach causes fibrosis and scarring, leading to hearing loss over time,"" said Dr. Wanna.

Cowen & Co estimates that use of DNA blood tests for cancer screening will exceed $10 billion a year by the end of the decade.\n\nBut the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health.\n\nThe company has already run into trouble on a similar issue. In 2010, Walgreens pulled Pathway’s genetic testing kits from its pharmacies after U.S. health regulators warned patients might take action without understanding the results.\n\nSeveral oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway’s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. Doctors will also need a clear assessment of their accuracy.\n\n“For any given test, the rate of false positives causing unnecessary alarm and false negatives that provide false security should be known,” said Dr. Keith Stewart, an oncologist who heads Mayo Clinic’s Center for Individualized Medicine.\n\nPathway’s screening test looks at 96 genetic markers associated with major cancer types such as breast, ovarian, lung, colon and melanoma. The company is focusing on mutations that are relatively well-understood, and for which there are specific treatments, said Chief Executive Jim Plante.\n\nThe cost to consumers begins at $299 to periodically check for DNA in their blood that could act as an early warning sign of cancer. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient’s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.\n\nPathway also launched a blood test for patients already diagnosed with cancer to help determine whether a treatment is working, or whether the disease is likely to return.\n\nSCREENING VS MONITORING\n\nScientists have long known that cancers shed bits of genetic material into the blood. Privately held Guardant Health and Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc already offer blood tests for cancer patients. Roche-backed Foundation Medicine Inc, Genomic Health Inc, Illumina Inc and Sequenom Inc say they have similar tests in the works.\n\nBut cancer experts say there are major differences between using such tests to screen for cancer and monitoring patients who are already known to have it.\n\nFor example, some early cancers may not secrete DNA fragments into the bloodstream and require other types of detection. A colonoscopy can find and remove polyps before they pose a threat as colon cancer.\n\n“If we are relying on a test that can only detect cancer after it has formed, we miss a huge opportunity to intervene,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nPatients might be attracted to a less-invasive test for colon cancer, but if it is less effective, it might result in more cases of colon cancer, not fewer.\n\nAnother concern is that the tests may pick up on markers that are never destined to be cancer, something already known to occur in blood tests for prostate cancer, Kopetz said.\n\nPathway says its test is more than 99 percent accurate in detecting mutations in blood samples that contain at least nine copies of a tested mutation.\n\n“We do expect to detect cancer DNA when the tumors are small - much sooner than stage three or four,” Plante said.\n\nDr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer geneticist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said Pathway’s figure represents the test’s technical ability to detect DNA in the blood.\n\nDoctors, however, need an indication of how many patients will get a false positive result, something that can only be determined in a very large clinical trial, said Vogelstein. He is advising two companies developing liquid biopsy tests for cancer screening: Sysmex and Personal Genome Diagnostics.\n\nPlante said the company has started two clinical trials involving patients but has yet to publish any results on how the tests perform in people.']","This story wasn’t dazzled by the novelty of a liquid biopsy and provided enough cautionary notes, more so than a competing Bloomberg story.","This story did a very nice job of examining the premise behind “liquid biopsies” and pointing out the lack of supporting evidence — a slightly more thorough look than was given by a strong competing story from Bloomberg. While the story could have had a fuller explanation of the costs associated with liquid biopsies and how the tests are ordered, it better explained the potential harms and made better use of independent sources to provide context than Bloomberg did.

The study is available online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology ● Biology ● Physics, the flagship journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).\n\nWith brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy (RT), implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue. Reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate, which is surrounded by multiple critical structures. In contrast to low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy, where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months, HDR treatments deposit the dose in one treatment, after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient.\n\nTypically, HDR brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions, which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants. While the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session, data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited. In this study, researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with LDR brachytherapy, but with the convenience of a single visit.\n\n“It is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure,” said lead study author Daniel J. Krauss, MD, a radiation oncologist at Oakland University’s William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak, Michigan. “We found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects.”\n\nThe study, which appeared in the Red Journal’s January 2017 issue, presented the results of a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial of 58 patients with low- or intermediate-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer, with a median follow-up period of 2.9 years. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. The median patient age was 63 years (range 43-73), and 91 percent of the patients presented with stage T1 disease.\n\nAt an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. Within the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\n\n“This study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,” said Dr. Krauss. “Giving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate—meaning the bladder, urethra and rectum—but this was not found to be the case. Toxicity rates were extremely low, with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of 58 patients.”\n\nWhile findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, the article also emphasizes the need for additional follow-up to compare long-term cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches, which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the 19 Gy dose used in this trial.\n\n“As the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards. One thing that this study has made clear, however, is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials,” said Dr. Krauss. “While additional study and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for single-fraction HDR brachytherapy, we are optimistic that the single-treatment approach can eventually become a standard practice for prostate cancer treatment.”\n\nFor more information or a copy of the full study, contact ASTRO’s media relations team at press@astro.org.

Recognizing that a higher dose, single radiation treatment could be more toxic to tissues surrounding the prostate, this trial set out to measure the effectiveness and safety of such treatment. While the research was non-randomized, its generally positive tone was balanced by emphasizing that there needs to be additional follow-up research to see how it compares with conventional approaches.
After stating in the headline the treatment “may be safe and effective,” the release provides a fairly detailed description of harms.
A concern with this study is that nearly all of the patient volunteers would have been candidates for active surveillance–meaning that they did not need an active treatment.

It’s most common in older women, but about seven percent of white men and five percent of black men are affected, according to the American College of Physicians.\n\nIn the new study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, Robin M. Daly from the University of Melbourne, Australia and colleagues randomly assigned men aged 59 to 70 to an exercise program, drinking milk fortified with calcium and vitamin D, doing both, or doing nothing.\n\nThey measured the men’s bone density before and after the study, which took place over 18 months, but they didn’t look at fractures.\n\nAt the end of the study, men who exercised had higher bone density than those who had supplemented their diet with 1000 milligrams of calcium and 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D per day.\n\nAdding the supplements to the exercise program provided no extra benefit, hinting that the men already had enough vitamin D and calcium in their diets to be able to boost their bone strength through exercise alone.\n\nThe recommended daily intake of vitamin D is 600 IU in adults up to age 70, and 800 IU for older people, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). A 6-month supply of vitamin D supplements can be bought for less than $10, and many multivitamins contain the recommended daily dose of vitamin D.\n\nAs for calcium, the NIH advises 1,000 mg per day for men ages19-70, and then 1,200 mg per day for men older than 70.\n\nTo build bone density, weight-bearing exercise is needed, such as running or weight-lifting, according to the NIH.\n\nIn animal studies, a lack of vitamin D has been linked to several diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and some types of cancer. However, there isn’t enough data to say if vitamin D can help treat or prevent these diseases, Zaidi said.\n\nTo reduce the risk of bone weakening, the NIH recommends not smoking, drinking less alcohol and exercising more.\n\nZaidi said that both vitamin D and calcium are extremely important for human health, so people should follow the previous vitamin D and calcium recommendations.\n\n“You’ve got to have it to build a wall,” he said. “Adding more might not strengthen the wall, but you have to take enough to keep the wall strong.

These drugs, which are often used in combination with alcohol, have potentially life-threatening effects, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nThe newest study explored the effects of MDMA on 21 healthy volunteers, nine women and 12 men aged 18 to 38. All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. They were randomly assigned to take either a low or moderate dose of MDMA, methamphetamine or a sugar pill during four sessions in about a three-week period.\n\nEach session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. During that time, participants stayed in a laboratory testing room, and social interaction was limited to contact with a research assistant who helped administer cognitive exams.\n\nA moderate dose of MDMA was found to significantly increase feelings of loving, friendliness and playfulness, the researchers said, whereas the low dose of MDMA boosted feelings of loneliness.\n\nThe moderate dose also prompted a drop in the ability to accurately recognize fear in other people\'s faces, determined by having the participants look at a range of photos, the study found, but it did not affect the ability to perceive the shifting cues in a person\'s eyes or voice, determined by having the participants listen to a series of audio clips.\n\nThis effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others.\n\nIn a twist, the researchers also found that methamphetamine similarly prompted feelings of friendliness and loving. In fact, those who took the drug actually rated themselves as more sociable than those taking MDMA.\n\nAs a warning, the researchers noted that MDMA might indeed facilitate socializing, but it also might impair a person\'s perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk-taking.\n\nNonetheless, the researchers suggested that MDMA might help people with PTSD as well those with autism, schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder cope with a variety of emotional difficulties.\n\n""More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are,"" Bedi said.\n\nDr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.\n\n""First, I think it\'s very important that we investigate potential new therapies, and that we shouldn\'t be dissuaded from doing that just because something can be misused,"" he said. ""Many things can be life-threatening or dangerous if used incorrectly. But if used in the right setting wisely, many things can also be helpful. So there\'s no question we should be looking into how this might benefit people who are suffering.""\n\nThe results of his earlier study, which had focused on the moderate dose of MDMA, ""were very promising,"" Mithoefer said. ""Now, there\'s a long way to go between that and proving effectiveness. But it certainly suggests, just as these findings suggest, that the question merits further investigation.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more on MDMA.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was a shallow job of reporting on a very small study in healthy volunteers.  It raised more questions than it answered.</span>","The story is based on an early basic science study, evaluating the short-term effects of Ecstasy.  But the story reports this very limited preliminary finding as if there were therapeutic meaning – even raising possible therapeutic value in the headline.

Both studies were published Monday in the Archives of Surgery,\n\nLast week, the FDA broadened approval for the Lap-Band to people with a Body Mass Index as low as 30 if they also have a weight-related medical condition, a move that is expected to propel millions more obese patients into the offices of bariatric surgeons. The Lap-Band is an inflatable ring that is surgically implanted around the upper stomach. After surgical wounds have healed, saline solution is injected to expand the ring, limiting how much food can be consumed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet both of the new studies suggest that the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, which is named for the surgeon who invented it and the shape of the altered small intestine, remains the standard for patients with severe obesity and serious weight-related illnesses such as diabetes. The procedure was first performed in 1993.\n\nThe UC San Francisco study, led by surgeon Guilherme M. Campos, measured weight loss, improvement in metabolic function and quality of life in 185 patients one year after their surgeries.\n\nOn all those measures, gastric bypass produced far better results than Lap-Band surgery. For instance, those who had had gastric bypass lost 64% of their excess weight on average in the year following surgery. Those who got the Lap-Band lost an average of 36% in the same period.\n\nThe study also found that although gastric bypass patients had more complications in the first month after surgery, those who underwent Lap-Band surgery had a higher rate of complications later, and/or more need for surgical adjustments, making the overall complication rate similar for both procedures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe authors concluded that gastric bypass “has a better risk-benefit profile” than Lap-Band surgery. The second study, conducted by researchers in Taiwan, compared 30 obese patients who were treated with gastric bypass for their poorly controlled diabetes with 30 similar patients who were treated with a procedure called “gastric sleeving,” which surgically reshapes the stomach to a smaller size but does not close down a portion of the intestine to food.\n\nThe finding — that diabetes improved with gastric bypass but not with gastric sleeving — offered an important clue to why gastric bypasses seem to improve the metabolic function of diabetics virtually overnight. Neither sleeve gastrectomy nor the Lap-Band causes food to bypass any part of the intestine, suggesting that hormones in that part of the gut may play a key role in the changes that lead to diabetes.\n\n“We need to just register that gastric bypass is the gold standard for diabetic control in overweight patients,” said Beverly Hills-based weight-loss surgeon Ted Khalili, director of the Khalili Center for Bariatric Care, who was not involved in the study.\n\nBut Khalili, whose practice is roughly split between Lap-Band and gastric-bypass surgery, added that the UC San Francisco findings are far less clear for patients whose primary objective is to lose weight. Although more weight loss was seen for the gastric bypass group in the one-year study, patients getting the Lap-Band continue to lose weight for two to three years after the procedure, Khalili said.\n\nComparing the two patient populations three years after surgery would probably have narrowed the weight-loss gap considerably, Khalili said.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Our three reviewers thought that this story about three different surgical weight loss procedures (gastric bypass, gastric band, and sleeve gastrectomy) gives readers an incomplete picture of the evidence. <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3664"" target=""_blank"">HealthDay’s was slightly better</a>. </span>","First, it suggests that the findings of a new study showing superior results for gastric bypass on certain outcomes are novel and perhaps surprising.

They do not. More context on the other studies that have been performed in this area — some much larger and more representative of the experience of a broad cross-section of patients — would have helped correct these deficiencies.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the injectable drug Siliq (broadalumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults.\n\nBecause of an association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, Siliq will be sold with a “black box” warning and should be considered only for patients whose psoriasis has not responded—or has stopped responding—to phototherapy or to other systemic medicines taken orally or via injection.\n\nPlaque psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes cells to build up on the surface of the skin, forming thick red patches and flaky silver-white scales. Current treatment options for psoriasis include topical treatments (like corticosteroids) phototherapy (using an ultraviolet light box or a laser) and systemic drugs—delivered via a pill, an injection or an IV infusion—that work throughout the body.\n\nSiliq is unique because it binds to the receptor of a protein called interleukin-17, a known contributor to inflammation. By blocking the receptor from being activated, it keeps the body from receiving signals that can fuel inflammatory responses and psoriasis progression. Two other psoriasis drugs currently on the market work similarly, but instead bind to the protein itself.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThis small difference is significant, says Dr. Richard Fried, a member of the National Psoriasis Foundation medical board, since responses to drug treatments can vary dramatically from person to person. “Having another agent in our armamentarium that works by a different mechanism is a welcome addition and may prove beneficial to many psoriasis suffers,” he says in an email. (Fried says he has no involvement with the drug or the drug company.)\n\nIn the three clinical trials considered for drug approval, more than 50% of patients who used Siliq achieved total skin clearance—the ultimate goal of psoriasis treatments—within a year. The most common side effects of the drug were joint and muscle pain, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain, nausea, flu, low white blood cell count, fungal infections and reactions at the injection site.\n\nThe drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. In a total of six clinical trials totaling about 6,200 participants, six suicides were reported by people receiving Siliq. People with a history of suicide attempts or depression had an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. Patients must also agree to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening mood changes, anxiety or suicidal thoughts.\n\nA causal association between Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Fried, a dermatologist and clinical psychologist, points out that psoriasis itself can be associated with mental health problems.\n\n“Effective treatment has consistently shown reduction in the incidence and severity of depression and reduced likelihood of suicide,” says Fried. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.\n\nSiliq, like other psoriasis medications, also affects the immune system. It can raise patients’ risk of infections and shouldn’t be used by people with certain chronic conditions, such as Crohn’s disease or active tuberculosis infections. People should also avoid immunizations with live vaccines while being treated with Siliq.\n\n“Patients and their health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of Siliq before considering treatment,” said Dr. Julie Beitz, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in an agency press release.\n\nThe drug’s recommended dosage schedule is an injection once a week for the first three weeks, followed by an injection every other week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Siliq’s manufacturer, says that pricing information is not available at this time, and expects to begin sales and marketing in the second half of 2017.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]","Given the suicide risk, news stories ideally emphasize that it remains unclear how this new treatment will compare in terms of effectiveness and safety to existing medicines.","
This Time magazine story reports on the FDA approval of a new drug–Siliq–for the treatment of psoriasis, an autoimmune skin disorder.
The story does a good job of outlining the risks of the new drug, citing its link to suicide among users, as well as a number of side effects. The story emphasizes that the risk is great enough to require warning labeling on the packaging.  But, ideally, it would have delved more deeply into the evidence behind this drug, looking at the drug development process and if there are any reasons to be skeptical (as we note in our review of the FDA’s news release on the approval of Siliq, there indeed are).
One quibble about the headline: It stresses that Siliq is “different” than other psoriasis drugs. The story explains this is because it binds with targeted proteins in a slightly different way than other similar drugs. But so far, it’s not known if this matters to anyone.

People with a family history of melanoma are better off wearing sunscreen and getting regular skin checks from a dermatologist, Asgari recommended.\n\n“I think it’s just too early” to say NSAIDs offer any protection, she said. “I think the jury is still out.”\n\nThere’s reason to hope NSAIDs might offer some protection against this type of cancer, however - earlier this year, a review found that people who use painkillers such as ibuprofen on a regular basis may be less likely to get bladder cancer. Other research has consistently supported the benefits of NSAIDs in preventing colorectal cancer, and provided some evidence they may work for breast, esophagus, and stomach cancers, as well.\n\nMelanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, killing almost 9,000 people in the U.S. last year, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nTo investigate whether NSAIDs offer any protection, Dr. Clara Curiel-Lewandrowski of Harvard Medical School and the University of Arizona asked 400 people diagnosed with melanoma and 600 similar people without the disease to recall their use of the painkillers.\n\nThe researchers found that people without cancer had a longer history of taking NSAIDs than people who eventually developed melanoma. Specifically, more than 40 percent of people who were cancer-free said they’d been taking NSAIDs at least once per week for more than 5 years, versus only 28 percent of those who developed melanoma. Overall, regular use of NSAIDs for more than 5 years appeared to reduce the risk of developing cancer by more than 40 percent, the authors report in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n\nUnfortunately, the technique — comparing people with melanoma to those without - is fraught with potential problems, said Asgari. For one, you have to get the comparison right, she noted; there’s always a concern that people without cancer who agree to participate in the study may be more health conscious to begin with, and it’s this that protects them from cancer, not their use of NSAIDs. “Did you somehow get a biased sample of people, and is that why you’re seeing this difference?”\n\nHer 2008 study analyzed data from nearly 64,000 people who were melanoma-free at the beginning of the investigation, then followed them for a few years to see who developed the disease. She and her colleagues found no evidence that taking NSAIDs had any effect on risk of developing the deadly skin cancer.\n\nAs a result, “I wouldn’t recommend (taking NSAIDs to reduce melanoma) just based on this” new study, Asgari noted.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/hjf0o1 Journal of Investigative Dermatology, March 10, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">We shuddered when we saw this headline, “Can painkillers prevent melanoma?”, dreading what might come next. </span>","Instead, this story clearly and efficiently reported what was found and why:

But now new research suggests a popular sugar substitute could lead to new treatments for some of the most common types of cancers.\n\nIn findings presented at the National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), a team of researchers from the University of Florida College of Medicine examined how saccharin, the artificial sweetener that is the main ingredient in Sweet \'N Low®, Sweet Twin® and Necta®, reacted with a protein found in aggressive cancer cells.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe protein, called carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), regulates pH in and around cancer cells, allowing tumors to thrive and potentially metastasize to other parts of the body. It is found in a wide range of aggressive cancers, including breast, lung, liver, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancer.\n\n“If you disrupt this pH balance via blocking CA IX activity, you can stop these cancer cells from growing and proliferating,” study author Brian Mahon, a graduate research assistant at the University of Florida, told FoxNews.com.\n\nMahon said the research stemmed from a study from the University of Florence in Italy that suggested saccharin would selectively block the activity of CA IX. He said his team, led by University of Florida’s Dr. Robert McKenna, wanted to further investigate saccharin’s effect in treating cancer.\n\n""It never ceases to amaze me how a simple molecule such as saccharin— something many people put in their coffee every day— may have untapped uses, including as a possible lead compound to target aggressive cancers,"" McKenna said.\n\nCA IX is not normally found in healthy human cells. McKenna said that’s why it’s a prime target for anti-cancer drugs, as they would cause little to no side effects to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. Previous attempts to find an element that blocks CA IX without damaging other cells have been unsuccessful.\n\nResearchers used X-ray crystallography to determine how saccharin binds to CA IX, and are using that information to develop ways to fine-tune and improve its anti-cancer treatment potential. The goal is to develop drugs that could slow the growth of these cancers and potentially make them less resistant to chemo or radiation therapies. Currently, saccharin’s effects are being tested on breast and liver cancer cells.\n\n""This result opens up the potential to develop a novel anti-cancer drug that is derived from a common condiment that could have a lasting impact on treating several cancers,"" McKenna said.\n\nResearchers warn the findings don’t warrant adding large quantities of artificial sweeteners to your diet, but they say their findings may offer promise for the development of an anti-cancer drug derived from an ingredient that ironically was once considered a possible carcinogen.']","This is another Fox News story that teases the reader with a hyped-up headline, but then fails to offer data to back it up.

The standard of care for detecting such blood-borne infections is blood culture, but this takes days to complete, only identifies pathogens in less than 30% of patients with fulminant infections, and it is not able to detect toxic fragments of dead pathogens that also drive the exaggerated inflammatory reactions leading to sepsis.\n\nBiomarkers that report elevated inflammation are used clinically in the treatment of patients with sepsis; however, they fail to distinguish inflammation triggered by infectious pathogens from that induced by non-infectious causes, such as burns, traumas and surgeries.\n\nNow, a Wyss Institute team led by Donald Ingber reports in eBioMedicine that it has filled this void with a rapid and specific diagnostic assay that could help physicians decide within an hour whether a patient has a systemic infection and should be hospitalized for aggressive intervention therapy. The potential of this assay to detect pathogen materials was demonstrated in both animal studies and a prospective human clinical study, whose results also suggest that it also could serve as a companion diagnostic to monitor the success of antibiotic and dialysis-like sepsis therapies.\n\n""Our pathogen detection technology solves both dilemmas: it quickly reports whether infectious pathogens are present in the body, even at early stages of infection before sepsis develops. And it can more specifically identify patients who have excessive inflammation due to systemic infection, rather than other causes,"" said Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., the Wyss Institute\'s Founding Director, the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children\'s Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. ""This assay could become a real game changer in this clinical area, and it also should lead to more judicious use of antibiotics, helping to decrease the worrisome rise we are seeing in antibiotic-resistant organisms.""\n\n""In a cohort of emergency room patients with suspected sepsis, we saw that the assay picked up infection within an hour in 85% of patients who exhibited clinical symptoms of sepsis, and equally importantly, it did not falsely predict infection in healthy subjects or patients with inflammation triggered by other causes, such as trauma. On the other hand, blood cultures that we performed in parallel using the same samples only detected pathogens in 18% of the cases,"" said Nathan Shapiro, M.D., Ph.D., Director of Translational Research in the Center for Vascular Biology Research at BIDMC, who worked with Ingber\'s team to conduct the clinical study. ""This highlights the advance this technology represents.""\n\nThe diagnostic assay is built on FcMBL, a genetically engineered pathogen-binding protein previously developed by Ingber and Michael Super, a Wyss Senior Staff Scientist who co-leads the Institute\'s pathogen-detecting effort. FcMBL binds to pathogens and pathogen-released fragments, known as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) by recognizing carbohydrate molecules on their surface.\n\nPrevious efforts in Ingber\'s team at the Wyss Institute have established FcMBL as a key component of an advanced dialysis-like, pathogen-extracting therapeutic device, and of a method for the fast retrieval of infectious pathogens from complex clinical samples to enable their identification and antibody susceptibilities.\n\n""In our latest work, we show that the FcMBL-based pathogen-detecting assay is considerably faster and more accurate than any other available assay for systemic infection. We are currently working to ready it for high-throughput use in clinical and point of care situations and to accelerate it even further,"" said Mark Cartwright, Ph.D., a Staff Scientist at the Wyss Institute and a lead-author on the study.\n\nAs a prerequisite to their clinical study, the Wyss Institute\'s team had successfully tested the assay in rat and pig models of infection with pathogenic E. coli bacteria.\n\n""The animal models clearly told us that the assay can sensitively trace spikes of PAMPs released during antibiotic therapy, or residual infectious PAMP materials, even when no living bacteria circulate anymore in blood but they remain hidden inside internal organs. Thus, this assay could be an excellent tool for monitoring ongoing infection and responses to antibiotics and dialysis-like therapies for severe infections and sepsis,"" said Mike Super, Ph.D.\n\nTogether, the findings suggest that the FcMBL-based pathogen detection technology with its rapid handling time, high sensitivity and broad specificity towards infection-causing pathogens could provide a real-world advance to diagnose life-threatening infections in both clinical microbiology laboratories and point-of-care settings.\n\n###\n\nThe work was funded by the Wyss Institute and the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA).\n\nPRESS CONTACTS\n\nWyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University\n\nBenjamin Boettner, benjamin.boettner@wyss.harvard.edu, +1 917-913-8051\n\nMULTIMEDIA CONTACT\n\nWyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University\n\nSeth Kroll, seth.kroll@wyss.harvard.edu, +1 617-432-7758\n\nThe Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University uses Nature\'s design principles to develop bioinspired materials and devices that will transform medicine and create a more sustainable world.

BIDMC is the official hospital of the Boston Red Sox.']",Transparency is key when describing the merits of new tests and therapies.,"This news release from a Harvard bioengineering and tech transfer institute describes animal and early clinical studies of a relatively new test for quickly diagnosing the presence of blood-borne bacteria that can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition. The test detects pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs, in the blood. The assay would potentially be used to distinguish such infections early and help determine if and when a patient should be hospitalized for aggressive antibiotic treatment.
The release ably explains what is potentially life-saving and novel about the assay. However, the release makes no mention of the company, Opsonix, launched by the Wyss Institute research team last fall to develop and commercialize the technology for patients at risk of sepsis; nor does the release offer much quantitative or qualitative details about the animal or human studies of this proof-of-principal research.

The approach holds particular promise for patients whose coronary artery disease could require multiple implants over the course of several decades, said Mitchell Krucoff, a professor at Duke University Medical Center who has advised Abbott on Absorb.\n\n“This is a game changer,” he said in an interview. “There are no longer going to be permanent metal implants in the artery.”\n\nAbsorb releases the drug everolimus to combat the growth of scar tissue that can form within a stent and cause the artery to narrow again, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the stent, said.\n\n“No metal means the treated artery can pulse and flex naturally as demands on the heart change with everyday activities,” said Gregg Stone of Columbia University Medical Center, who led clinical trials for Absorb. “No metal may also reduce the potential of future blockages that occur with permanent metallic stents.”\n\nData released in October concluded Absorb was comparable to Abbott’s own Xience drug-coated metal stent in safety and effectiveness but showed a higher risk of heart attacks and blood clots. Abbott said it expects the risks to lessen as surgeons gain experience with it.\n\nAbsorb also will compete with Medtronic Plc’s traditional drug-coated Resolute stent and Boston Scientific Corp’s Synergy and Promus stents. Synergy’s polymer coating disappears over time after delivering a drug that helps prevent the artery from re-clogging, leaving a metal stent in place.\n\nAbbott plans to roll out the device to about 100 hospitals in the next several months as it trains surgeons on the implant procedure before ramping up sales, said spokesman Jonathon Hamilton. Absorb will be priced at a “modest” premium to Xience, he said. Analysts have predicted Absorb will gain a market niche but not surpass drug-dispensing metal stents such as Xience in share until longer-term data show more favorable clinical results.']","Unlike its AP counterpart, this story left out the fact that long-term safety and effectiveness data for this device is unknown.","
Doctors often treat coronary artery disease with a procedure called angioplasty to widen clogged or narrowed arteries using a metal stent.  But those stents have been problematic for some patients, leading to blood clots and even heart attacks. The FDA has just approved medical use of a dissolvable stent manufactured by Abbott Labs, and this story heralds that decision.
The Reuters story included some details the Associated Press version did not–namely, what the stent is made of, what kind of drug is coated onto it, and what the plans are for rolling it out to hospitals.
But its almost giddy approach to the FDA announcement belies the fact that long-term safety and efficacy data are not yet in hand.  Put another way, no one yet knows if these dissolvable stents will make a practical difference in heart disease patient outcomes. The AP story makes that crucial information a centerpiece of the text and, we think, does its readers a greater service.

The drug was then developed by Imperial, in collaboration with Emory University in the USA.\n\nEarly lab-based tests of ICEC0942 were successful in targeting resistant breast cancers and indicated minimal side effects. ICEC0942 was then licenced to Carrick Therapeutics, who developed it into a molecule named CT7001, which they have taken to early-stage clinical trials in less than two years.\n\nThe first patient was given the drug in November 2017 as part of Carrick\'s a Phase I clinical trial to assess its safety and how well it can be tolerated. The trial is still ongoing, so results are not available yet.\n\nProfessor Charles Coombes, from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, said: ""Treatment-resistant tumours represent a significant threat for patients, as once a cancer stops responding to treatments there is increasingly little clinicians can do.\n\n""Drugs such as these could help to shift the balance back in favour of the patients, potentially providing a new option to patients for who existing treatments no longer work.""\n\nProfessor Tony Barrett, from the Department of Chemistry, said: ""This work is the result of extensive collaboration between chemists, biologists and clinicians, which has helped to bring a new treatment from discovery to clinical testing in record time, streamlining the process.""\n\nThe drug targets an enzyme called CDK7, involved in directing cells through their lifecycle, which consists of growth, DNA replication and cell division. CDK7 is also involved in the process of transcription, a vital step in gene expression - the creation of proteins to carry out cell functions. Particular cancers, such as treatment-resistant breast cancers, have a unique dependence on transcription, meaning targeting CDK7 may be particularly effective.\n\nBy inhibiting transcription, ICEC0942 shuts down the ability of the cancer to spread. As well as breast cancers, cancers such as acute myeloid leukaemia and small-cell lung cancer are particularly transcription-dependent, so ICEC0942 may work well for these too, especially where they have become resistant to other treatments.\n\nThe discovery of the drug was spurred by an initial meeting between Professor Anthony Barrett, from the Department of Chemistry, and oncologist Professor Charles Coombes from the Department of Surgery & Cancer.\n\nProfessor Simak Ali, also from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, was working on understanding the action of CDK7 in treatment-resistant breast cancer. Professors Coombes and Ali suggested CDK7 as a drug target, leading the collaboration to attempt to design a molecule that would inhibit its action.\n\nFrom early attempts, a large collaborative team was eventually founded for drug discovery from \'bench to bedside\', directed by Dr Matthew Fuchter in the Department of Chemistry. Possible compounds for CDK7 inhibition were modelled using computational drug design, aided by collaboration with Emory University.\n\nUltimately, a candidate molecule called ICEC0942 suppressed tumour growth in a wide range of cancer types in lab tests. In addition, laboratory studies showed ICEC0942 worked better in combination with traditional hormone therapies for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, which have not yet become resistant. It is this molecule, in oral pill form, that was taken forward by Carrick as CT7001 and is currently in Phase I clinical trials. If the Phase I trial proves successful, the compound must pass further stages of trial over the next few years before it becomes available to patients.\n\nEarly funding for the study came from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and a major contribution of whole-project funding was from Cancer Research UK. Licensing of the technology to Carrick Therapeutics was led by Cancer Research UK\'s Commercial Partnerships Team and Imperial Innovations, the Technology Transfer Office of Imperial, with support from Emory University.\n\nDr Iain Foulkes, Cancer Research UK\'s executive director of research and innovation, said: ""It\'s exciting to see how Cancer Research UK\'s partnerships with both academia and industry are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients.\n\n""Drug resistance continues to be a major challenge across many cancer types so it\'s vital that we explore new ways to tackle tumours that have stopped responding to standard therapies. We hope that this promising new class of drug will offer more options to patients who have few left available to them, and help more people survive their cancer.""\n\n###']",An important financial conflict of interest and any discussion of potential harms were left out of the release.,"This news release touts a “new class of drug” that is being tested to treat cancers that are resistant to other therapies. The news release says the initial research was funded by the charity Cancer Research UK and the drug was licensed to Irish biotechnology firm Carrick Therapeutics, which is has begun conducting a safety study.
Laudably, the headline and the body of the news release caution that this isn’t a proven treatment. But there’s far more hype here than substance. The news release lauds researchers for quick action and offers a quote about how “exciting” it is that academia and industry “are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients.” But there’s no mention that Imperial College London has a patent on this drug. There’s also no discussion of how many patients might benefit from this, or acknowledgement of the extremely high prices for new cancer drugs.

It is an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland.\n\nCertain immune-system signaling molecules also target other tissues in the body, including in the eyes, which causes their bulging appearance, sometimes known as Graves’ eyes. About 30 percent of people with Graves’ disease develop mildly bulging eyes, and 2 to 5 percent develop severe bulge. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK.\n\nTeprotumumab blocks one of these immune signaling molecules, so researchers wanted to see what effect it might have on the eyes of Graves’ patients with moderate to severe bulge.\n\nThe study “included some of the worst cases imaginable and we’re now wondering whether the drug might find expanded utility in much-less-severe disease,” Smith told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nBy week 24, the response rate was 69 percent with the drug and 20 percent with placebo. Among those who completed therapy, the rates were 79 percent and 22 percent, respectively.\n\nMore people who received the drug had sizeable reductions in disease activity and reductions of 3 mm or more in eye bulge compared to the placebo group, the researchers note.\n\nHowever, while only 10 percent of patients who received the drug had double vision before the study, that rose to 50 percent by 24 weeks.\n\nHigh blood sugar was also a key side effect in participants who already had diabetes, the study team notes, but adjusting diabetes medications solved that problem.\n\nThe typical treatment for Graves’ eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes.\n\nThe drug, also known as RV001 or R1507, has been developed by Genmab and Roche. River Vision Development Corporation licensed the drug from Roche. On Monday, Horizon Pharma announced that it was acquiring River Vision, which paid for the new study.\n\nSmith said FDA approval could come sometime in 2018. Enrollment in a follow-up trial is expected to begin within six weeks.\n\nThe duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, “but future studies will sort that out,” Smith said.\n\nThe researchers also cautioned that the study only included volunteers with active disease of recent onset so “the potential of teprotumumab in benefiting patients with milder, less active, or stable disease was not assessed.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2qSTjSn New England Journal of Medicine, online May 3, 2017.']","The story does a lot of things well–it adequately quantifies the benefits from use of the drug, as well as outlining the potential risks associated with it.","This Reuters story reports on a clinical trial testing the use of a new experimental drug, teprotumumab, to relieve Graves’ ophthalmopathy, the bulging eyes that often affect patients with Graves’ disease.

For those managing diabetes, wine can help, study says","['People with Type 2 diabetes get an earful of grim lectures about their health prospects and endure much hardship to manage their condition well. But new research offers those who do so a rare reward. A glass of wine every day not only won’t hurt, says a new study: It can actually improve cardiac health, help manage cholesterol and foster better sleep.\n\nThe new research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that compared with a nightly glass of mineral water, a single glass of wine--red or white--offered those with well-managed Type 2 diabetes some benefits.\n\nAfter two years, those who drank a glass of white wine nightly improved their triglyceride levels compared with those who drank water or red wine.\n\nSee the most-read stories in Science this hour >>\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut red wine’s benefits were far more numerous and more pronounced than those of white wine: Ruby-colored varietals significantly increased participants’ HDL cholesterol--the “good” form of cholesterol that protects against heart disease--by nearly 10% and improved the overall cholesterol profiles of those who got it. Red wine drinkers also saw improvements in their apolipoprotein a1 levels--a measure of lipid metabolism.\n\nCompared with study participants who drank mineral water nightly and those who had a glass of white wine, diabetics who drank a glass of red wine nightly also had fewer symptoms of metabolic syndrome (hypertension, excess abdominal fat, high blood sugar and abnormal cholesterol levels) at the end of two years.\n\nIn people without disease, many studies have found that those who consume alcohol in moderation enjoy better health than those who do not consume any alcohol. Many researchers see that effect as an incidental benefit of alcohol itself, and the authors of the latest study set out believing the same.\n\nBut in the current study, the superiority of red wine over white wine in improving diabetes patients’ health suggests that alcohol is not the only thing at work here. While red and white wine contain roughly similar levels of alcohol per serving, red wine contains seven times more plant-based phenolic compounds (including resveratrol and quercetin) than does white wine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany researchers argue that it would take dozens of bottles of wine a day--hardly moderate consumption--to deliver polyphenols in volumes that could make a difference in health. But the authors of the current study said that future research should explore whether even the modest phenolic concentrations found in a single glass of red wine might offer measurable health benefits.\n\nThe American Diabetes Assn. leaves it to individuals to decide whether to consume alcohol in moderation. But many physicians caution those with diabetes about alcohol consumption, which can add calories, complicate glycemic control and derail self-discipline.\n\nThe latest study, conducted by researchers in Israel, Sweden, Germany and the United States, is the first randomized control trial to explore the effect of moderate wine consumption--no more than a single five-ounce serving per day--with alcohol abstention over a lengthy period.\n\nStudy participants were all alcohol abstainers at the outset of the study. And all maintained a Mediterranean-style diet throughout their participation, ensuring that the consumption of red wine, white wine or mineral water was the principal difference in their diets.\n\nGenetic inheritance also influenced whether and to what extent wine consumption helped. Carriers of a genetic variation that made them slow metabolizers of alcohol saw considerable improvements in their glycemic control when they consumed a glass of red or white wine daily, the study showed. Participants whose genetic profiles identified them as fast ethanol metabolizers saw no such benefit.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @LATMelissaHealy and “like” Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.\n\nALSO:\n\nWhat elephants can teach scientists about fighting cancer in humans\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudy reveals why gowns and gloves can be so dangerous for hospital workers\n\nScientists find DNA differences between gay men and their straight twin brothers']","This story never explains how much patients benefited from drinking wine in this study, and lacks any mention of potential harms associated with alcohol.","A trial that randomized people with Type 2 diabetes to drink one glass of either wine or water daily found that there might be some benefits to drinking the wine, according to this story. How much? Some. How much is that? The story doesn’t pin it down.

The test also has potential for early diagnosis of other degenerative neurological conditions, including Parkinson\'s, Alzheimer\'s and multiple sclerosis.\n\nResults of first clinical trials with glaucoma patients are published today (28/04/17) in the journal BRAIN.\n\nProfessor Francesca Cordeiro at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, who led the research, said: ""Detecting glaucoma early is vital as symptoms are not always obvious. Although detection has been improving, most patients have lost a third of vision by the time they are diagnosed. Now, for the first time, we have been able to show individual cell death and detect the earliest signs of glaucoma. While we cannot cure the disease, our test means treatment can start before symptoms begin. In the future, the test could also be used to diagnose other neurodegenerative diseases.""\n\nLoss of sight in patients with glaucoma is caused by the death of cells in the retina at the back of the eye. This cell death is called apoptosis.\n\nAs with other neurodegenerative conditions, more and more nerve cells are lost as the disease progresses.\n\nProfessor Philip Bloom, Chief Investigator at Western Eye Hospital, part of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, added: ""Treatment is much more successful when it is begun in early stages of the disease, when sight loss is minimal. Our developments mean we could diagnose patients 10 years earlier than was previously possible.""\n\nThe technique developed is called DARC, which stands for detection of apoptosing retinal cells. It uses a specially developed fluorescent marker which attaches to cell proteins when injected into patients. Sick cells appear as white fluorescent spots during eye examination. UCL Business, the commercialisation company of UCL, holds the patents for the technology.\n\nThe examination uses equipment used during routine hospital eye examinations. Researchers hope that eventually it may be possible for opticians to do the tests, enabling even earlier detection of the disease.\n\nThe research is funded by Wellcome Trust.\n\nBethan Hughes, from Wellcome\'s Innovation team said: ""This innovation has the potential to transform lives for those who suffer loss of sight through glaucoma, and offers hope of a breakthrough in early diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases. Loss of sight as you age is an incredibly difficult disability, impacting quality of life and independence.""\n\nInitial clinical trials were carried out on a small number of glaucoma patients and compared with tests on healthy people.

The meta-analysis appears as an online advance in Nutrition Reviews.\n\nThe study authors--Yoko Yokoyama, Ph.D., M.P.H., Susan Levin, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D., and Neal Barnard, M.D., F.A.C.C.--reviewed 30 observational studies and 19 clinical trials, which met their inclusion criteria. They find:\n\nA plant-based vegetarian diet is associated with total cholesterol that\'s 29.2 mg/dL lower in observational studies. In clinical trials, a plant-based diet lowers total cholesterol by 12.5 mg/dL.\n\nIn observational studies, a plant-based vegetarian diet is associated with a 22.9 mg/dL reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 3.6 mg/dL reduction in HDL cholesterol, compared to control groups following an omnivorous diet.\n\nIn clinical trials, a plant-based vegetarian diet lowers LDL cholesterol by 12.2 mg/dL and reduces HDL cholesterol by 3.4 mg/dL, compared to control groups following an omnivorous, low-fat, calorie-restricted, or a conventional diabetes diet.\n\nA plant-based vegetarian diet is not associated with statistically significant changes in triglyceride levels in observational studies or in clinical trials.\n\nThe authors predict the strong correlation between vegetarian diets and lower cholesterol levels may be due to the association a plant-based diet has with a lower body weight, a reduced intake of saturated fat, and an increased intake of plant foods, like vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and whole grains, which are naturally rich in components such as soluble fiber, soy protein, and plant sterols.\n\nThe study authors hypothesize that the greater risk reduction for total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels observed in the longitudinal studies is likely due to long-term adherence to plant-based eating patterns and changes in body composition.\n\n""The immediate health benefits of a plant-based diet, like weight loss, lower blood pressure, and improved cholesterol, are well documented in controlled studies,"" says study author Susan Levin, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. ""Our goal with studying plasma lipids throughout the lifespan is to capture the net risk reduction of using a vegetarian diet to control lipid levels. We hope to empower patients with new research about the long-term cardiovascular health benefits of a vegetarian diet, which include a reduced risk of a heart attack, stroke, and premature death.""\n\nCharles Ross, D.O., a member of the nonprofit Physicians Committee and a former emergency department physician, has firsthand experience with putting a plant-based diet into practice.\n\nDr. Ross is in his late 60s, takes no medications, and lowered his previously high total cholesterol from 230 mg/dL to a healthy 135 mg/dL after adopting a whole-food, plant-based diet in 2012. Within the first month of making the dietary change, he effortlessly lost 10 pounds. Within a year, Dr. Ross traded a 34-year career of practicing emergency medicine for a new career path: lifestyle medicine. After 5.5 years of making the career switch, he continues to host free biweekly nutrition classes for his primary care patients and the community. More than 700 people have enrolled to learn how to lose weight, eliminate the need for medications to treat type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol, and to simply feel better. His former hometown of Roseburg, Ore., is now a Blue Zones community. He is a part-time instructor at the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Northwest and hopes to set an example for future physicians.\n\n""I no longer work for a living,"" notes Dr. Ross, who now resides in Westfir, Ore. ""I wake up every day eager to hear about how a plant-based diet and a healthful lifestyle is changing and saving lives in our community. What I\'ve found is that if you want your patients to make significant health changes, you have to make them yourself. The prescription started to spread soon after my family, co-workers, neighbors, and friends heard about my experience.""\n\nFor clinicians concerned about spending extra time in and outside of the exam room, the study authors encourage time-strapped health care providers to refer patients to registered dietitians who can help with the transition to a plant-based vegetarian diet. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans highlights a healthy vegetarian diet as one of three healthful eating plans to follow.\n\nThe study authors also note hyperlipidemia, or elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. A 10 percent increase in the prevalence of treatment for hyperlipidemia can prevent 8,000 deaths each year. Taking small steps, like those proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel 3, which include assessing heart disease risk, making lifestyle and dietary recommendations, and assessing the need for future follow-up appointments and pharmaceutical interventions, could prevent approximately 20,000 heart attacks, 10,000 cases of coronary heart disease, and save almost $3 billion in medical costs each year.\n\n""To make any form of health care work and to truly power economic mobility, we have to get healthy,"" says Levin. ""The first place to start is by building meals around nutrient-packed, plant-based foods, which fit into nearly every cultural template, taste preference, and budget.""\n\n###\n\nTo request a copy of the study or to request an interview with a study author, please contact Jessica Frost at 202-527-7342.\n\nFounded in 1985, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine is a nonprofit organization that promotes preventive medicine, conducts clinical research, and encourages higher standards for ethics and effectiveness in research.']",Less reliance on anecdote and an explanation of the limitations of observational studies would have improved the release.,"This news release reports on a meta-analysis that examined the effects of a plant-based vegetarian diet on cholesterol and triglyceride levels measured in the blood. The release does a good job of describing the benefits of a plant-based vegetarian diet compared to other diet types as it relates to cholesterol. It also makes mention of other mechanisms that could account for the observed changes seen in cholesterol levels and appropriately uses terms like “association” and “correlation” when describing the findings rather than cause-and-effect language.
However, the release goes too far in crediting a vegetarian diet for reductions in heart attacks, strokes, and premature death. Those outcomes weren’t part of the analysis.
Other things that would have made the release better: less reliance on a very subjective anecdote and an explanation of the limitations of observational studies. It would have also been good to note that cholesterol is a surrogate marker for heart disease, not a specific health outcome. Finally, readers would be better served with a more balanced comparison with other types of diets, including the Mediterranean diet.

This suggests that including the scans in routine care would not lead to a surge in costly tests or additional heart surgery, the researchers say.\n\nPatients who are at risk of a heart attack are frequently diagnosed with a test called an angiogram. This involves inserting tubes into the body and heart to check the flow of blood and identify any obstructions that could pose a heart attack risk.\n\nCTA scans enable doctors to look at the blood vessels from the outside the body, without the need to insert tubes into the heart. The scans are cheaper, quicker and safer than angiograms.\n\nThe study had previously found that around a quarter of patients had their diagnoses reclassified after receiving the scan, prompting new treatments in many cases.\n\nThis is the first study to look at the impact of the scans on long-term survival rates.\n\nLead researcher Professor David Newby, of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""This relatively simple heart scan ensures that patients get the right treatment. This is the first time that CT guided management has been shown to improve patient outcomes with a major reduction in the future risk of heart attacks. This has major implications for how we now investigate and manage patients with suspected heart disease.""\n\n###\n\nThe research is published in the New England Journal of Medicine and is being presented at the European Society of Cardiology Annual Congress in Munich.

But there’s a flaw in the headline and first sentence of the release. This study shows zero difference in deaths, and as the authors acknowledge in the published study, the entire difference between the groups was driven by non-fatal heart attacks.  Another problem with the news release is that these benefits are expressed in dramatic relative terms, instead of the much more modest (and helpful) absolute terms. Readers are left with little guidance regarding what may account for the slight drop, and if this really represents a “major” reduction as claimed by the lead author.
Finally, readers would have been better served if a discussion of alternative screening methods, conflicts of interest, and potential downstream costs and risks had been included. As a positive, the release mentions the potential to avoid invasive testing via angiogram, which has a very real death rate.

In the brexanolone trials, we saw patients starting to feel better within days,” said the trial’s academic principal investigator, Samantha Meltzer-Brody, MD, MPH, director of Perinatal Psychiatry Program at the UNC School of Medicine.\n\nDavid Rubinow, MD, chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the UNC School of Medicine and a coauthor of the paper, says time is especially crucial for new mothers experiencing postpartum depression because the weeks and months following birth are a critical period for mother-infant bonding. Common symptoms of PPD – a mood disorder in women that can be triggered by fluctuations in reproductive hormones – include low mood, feeling overwhelmed, anxious and ruminating thoughts, potential withdrawal from the baby and her family, and suicidal thoughts in the most severe cases. PPD is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, with between 10 and 20 percent of mothers worldwide experiencing it.\n\n“Having a drug developed specifically for postpartum depression is a game-changer for women’s health,” said Meltzer-Brody. “With our latest results, we believe that brexanolone, if approved, could provide relief for women with a range of postpartum severity.”\n\nThe paper, published in The Lancet, includes a new integrated analysis of results from three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that took place at 30 sites in the U.S., including UNC’s Perinatal Psychiatry Unit. Eligible women were aged 18-45 years old and were six months postpartum or less at screening. They also had to be experiencing moderate to severe postpartum depression, which was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D).\n\nThe integrated analysis looked at results of the trials which randomized 209 women to receive a double-blinded 60-hour infusion of either brexanolone injection 90 µg/kg/hr or placebo. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 µg/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Brexanolone injection 90 µg/kg/hr was administered to 102 women with moderate or severe PPD who also were evaluated throughout the infusion, after the infusion stopped and then periodically for up to 30 days. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe. The first statistically significant reduction in depression severity with brexanolone injection relative to placebo was observed as early as 24 hours after dosing. At the end of the 60-hour infusion, the average reduction in patients’ Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D or depression severity score) was 17.0 points for women in the brexanolone injection 90 µg/kg/hr group, versus 12.8 in the placebo group (p<0.0001). The reduction of symptoms in the patients receiving brexanolone injection was maintained throughout the last study visit at Day 30. The most common (≥10% of subjects) adverse events following during brexanolone injection administration were headache, dizziness and somnolence.\n\n“This is a very different model for how we treat depression. Having a drug approved to treat PPD that works quickly and effectively, yet is also durable, would be a huge step forward for psychiatry in general,” Meltzer-Brody said.\n\nBrexanolone injection is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GABAᴀ receptors. In postpartum depression, the GABA pathway may play a key role in regulating hormones that researchers believe can lead to PPD.\n\nSage Therapeutics is the developer of brexanolone injection and sponsor of the trials. A New Drug Application is currently under review by the FDA and brexanolone injection has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target date of December 19, 2018.']","This news release would have been stronger had it mentioned costs, and gone into more detail on harms and benefits.","An injectable drug, brexanolone, showed some effectiveness in treating postpartum depression in two phase 3 double-blind randomized controlled trials including 247 women from 30 different research centers, according to research led by the University of North Carolina. Their research showed reductions in reported depression symptoms among study volunteers receiving either the drug or placebo (17 points for those on the drug, compared to a reduction of 12.8 points reduction for those on a placebo).
This study about a potential new drug is important, but the way it is reported leaves holes for the reader. The research was funded by the drug maker, Sage Therapeutics, and the two researchers quoted in the release have financial links to the drug manufacturer. The release should have given us more context about the amount of improvement, and been straightforward about the conflicts of interest.

Currently, the standard treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy and prescription medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.\n\nHowever, an emerging field of research is exploring the use of probiotics--often thought of as ""good bacteria""--as a potential new avenue for treatment of bipolar and other psychiatric mood disorders. And a new study from Baltimore\'s Sheppard Pratt Health System, conducted by a research team led by Faith Dickerson, finds that a probiotic supplement may reduce inflammation of the gut, which is known to exacerbate bipolar disorder. Probiotic organisms are non-pathogenic bacteria that, when present in the gut flora, are known to improve the overall health of the host.\n\nIn recent years, research has demonstrated a strong link between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This connection, named the ""gut-brain axis"" (GBA), allows for crosstalk between the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems. The GI tract is also home to the intestinal microbiome, a complex population of roughly 100 trillion microorganisms (more than ten times the number of cells that make up the human body) that interacts with the mucosal lining of the GI tract. Studies have shown that the intimate association between the gut microbiome and GI tissue has a significant effect on the GBA.\n\nThere is also mounting evidence linking imbalances in the microbial species that make up the gut microbiome to a number of health problems including allergies, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric mood disorders.\n\nIn the case of bipolar disorder and the GBA, previous studies have shown that inflammation, or overstimulation of the body\'s immune system, is a contributing factor in the disease. With this in mind, researchers developed a probiotic supplement aimed at reducing inflammation caused by microbial imbalances in the gut.\n\nA group of patients recently hospitalized for mania participated in a 6-month study to track the effects of probiotic treatment on both their mood and the status of their immune system.\n\nThe patients were randomly selected to receive either the probiotic supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual medications. The results showed that the group receiving the probiotic supplement, on average, didn\'t return to the hospital as quickly and required less in-patient treatment time compared to the placebo group. The beneficial effects were most pronounced in those patients who exhibited abnormally high levels of inflammation at the beginning of the study.\n\nOverall, these results indicate that changes in intestinal inflammation can alter the trajectory of psychiatric mood disorders and that modulating the intestinal microbiota may be a new avenue of treatment for patients suffering from these diseases.\n\n###']","While probiotics have been a popular focus of research in recent years, the claim that they could help millions with bipolar disease is unwarranted.","This news release focuses on a study of the gut microbiome, an emerging avenue of research. The release would have been better had it provided more detail about the study (including the number of patients involved) and the sizes of the beneficial effects. Instead, the release relies heavily on speculative language, suggesting a direct connection between gut inflammation or “microbial imbalances” and mood disorders. Despite a slew of recent studies, no causal relationship has been established between the microbiome and mental health.

One way an aspiring mother can make it easier is to know when she’s most fertile, a period spanning a few days every month when her body undergoes hormonal changes. And certain body-tracking wristbands may be able to detect these subtle shifts in your biometrics, like your heart rate and body temperature. Depending on the device, it could even help you go one step further and actually conceive. Recently, the women’s health data startup Clue ran an internal test to see if Fitbits could improve the experience of women who track their periods on its popular app and are trying to get pregnant. Scientists put Fitbits on five employees and found that the devices could track their resting heart rate patterns during their menstrual cycles. The devices also showed that resting heart rate spiked shortly before ovulation began, according to the Berlin company, which presented data from the small, preliminary study at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology\'s annual meeting this month.\n\n“It’s a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant.”\n\nThe advantage of a passive sensor is ""these things are done kind of autonomously so you don\'t need to do much except check when the resting heart rate starts coming up,"" Clue\'s head of scientific research, Dr. Vedrana Högqvist Tabor, told BuzzFeed News. ""It\'s a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant.""\n\nFitbits aren\'t the only wearables that can track fertility-related biometrics in the background. After a Kickstarter campaign, YONO just started shipping an earpiece designed to track your body temperature at rest. And Ava is working on a smart wristband that aims to help women conceive.\n\nFitbit\n\nHow an Activity Tracker Caught an Unexpected Pregnancy Fitness trackers, by nature of being worn around the clock, have the potential to capture unexpected insights about how your body works — and simplify laborious acts like manually figuring out your fertile days. That traditionally involves taking your temperature when your body is at rest, examining your cervical mucus, and recording this data every single day on a calendar. Clue’s study, which ran for 13 months beginning in April 2015, didn’t set out to see whether the Fitbit ChargeHR could identify when a woman becomes pregnant. Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman’s resting heart rate changes when she’s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. For the experiment, five women under 40 wore a Fitbit ChargeHR to bed. That’s because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving. The women also logged their periods on Clue’s app, and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation. Researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles. A woman’s “fertile window” — when she’s likeliest to get pregnant — usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period, and lasts for about six or seven days, ending on the day of ovulation.\n\nClue\n\nAs the researchers had hypothesized, the participants\' Fitbits captured a portion of this fertile window by showing that their resting heart rates rose one or two days before ovulation, as well as during ovulation itself. So a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner, Högqvist Tabor said. And the study had one particularly unexpected outcome. Clue’s marketing director, who was participating, was puzzled when her Fitbit said her heart rate was up by several beats per minute. Högqvist Tabor said she soon realized what the finding meant, and broke the news to the marketing director: She was pregnant. The happy discovery was similar to one earlier this year, when a man posted on Reddit about how his wife’s Fitbit showed an uptick in her resting heart rate. Upon a Redditor’s suggestion, she took a test that confirmed she was in fact pregnant. An expert told BuzzFeed News at the time that her heart rate increase may have been an indirect result of elevated body temperature, another symptom of pregnancy. But Don\'t Think Of This As Birth Control Even though Clue’s marketing director happened to find out she was pregnant from her Fitbit, the point of the study was to demonstrate that it\'s possible to use Fitbit as a conception tool, not as a pregnancy test, Högqvist Tabor said. And that\'s provided that a couple doesn\'t have any other fertility-related problems.\n\nManually figuring out your fertile days is a laborious, multi-step process you have to do every single day.\n\nHowever, Högqvist Tabor said, this information by itself should not be used as a birth control method. A woman will be fertile four to five days before her increased resting heart rate will start showing up on a Fitbit — so having unprotected intercourse during this period could in fact lead to an unintended pregnancy. If you’re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn’t revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. (Högqvist Tabor says it\'s tricky because it depends on the individual, and can range from a few beats per minute to 10 beats per minute.)\n\nOne reason to potentially shy away from trusting Fitbit’s heart-rate sensors: In a class-action lawsuit, some unhappy consumers have accused them of being inaccurate. Regardless, Clue scientists say that they were more interested in the devices’ ability to capture the day-to-day differences in someone’s resting heart rate, which seemed to be consistent, and less interested in whether the devices could produce the exact values of resting heart rate. “You will get a relative change, even though it might not be as accurate as a chest strap,” said Clue co-founder Mike LaVigne.\n\nDaniel Winkler/Ava']","While the story mentions the small sample size, it doesn’t stress that a study involving only five people is statistically not meaningful.","
The story focuses on how wearable technology — particularly the Fitbit — could help women track their ovulation cycle in order to increase the odds of becoming pregnant. The story does, briefly, address the fact that this will not help women who have other medical obstacles to becoming pregnant, but could have done more to address (even in brief) meaningful issues related to infertility. Similarly, while the story mentions the small sample size of the relevant study, it doesn’t stress that a study involving only five people is statistically not significant.

Risk reduction [was] probably in the range of 80 to 95 percent,"" said researcher Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd women who had ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian cancer by as much as 80 percent.\n\nThe study findings are extremely reassuring to Rebbeck -- no breast cancer diagnoses among women who had double mastectomies after three years of follow-up. Among the women who did not have the surgery, 7 percent were later diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nRebbeck says these decreases are big but are cautions that cancer risk will never be brought down to zero. That\'s because all the tissue is never completely taken out.\n\n""Breast tissue is found throughout the torso and can\'t be completely removed through surgical means. And, with ovarian cancer, the ovary leaves behind cells that could go on to become cancerous. So, it\'s just not possible to remove all the tissue that might be at risk,"" he says.\n\nToby\'s Story\n\nOne of the women who decided to take that chance is 61-year-old Toby of New Jersey. (Because she\'s worried about her health coverage, she doesn\'t want her last name used.)\n\nToby\'s mother died of ovarian cancer when Toby was in her 20s. Researchers now know that disease is linked, along with breast cancer, to genetic mutations.\n\nToby had first her ovaries and then both breasts removed after she tested positive for the BRCA genes about five years ago.\n\nBut at first, she had hoped to avoid the surgery.\n\n""After my genetic testing, they would alternate mammogram with MRI every six months. I thought I was getting very, very good surveillance, and I thought that would probably be enough and they would be able to diagnose something very, very early and be able to cure me if I were to get breast cancer,"" she says.\n\nBut her doctors thought otherwise. Breast cancer caused by BRCA mutations is particularly aggressive. And they told Toby her lifetime risk of that type of cancer was as high as 90 percent.\n\nToby was one of the women researchers from around the country tracked in the study to see how they fared after having this surgery.\n\nWomen like Toby who chose both ovary and breast removal had dramatically lower risks of getting both cancers after the surgery. Only 3 percent of those who had surgery died, compared with 10 percent of those who did not, during the follow-up period.\n\nRole Of Genetic Testing\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Virginia Kaklamani, an oncologist at Northwestern University, says lives can be saved if women have genetic testing.\n\n""A lot of times I see these women having had a very preventable type of breast cancer. Preventable because I can identify the fact that they had a higher risk of getting breast cancer,"" she says.\n\n""Had they been genetically tested a few years prior to my seeing them, they would have had the option of having bilateral mastectomy. So, we could have prevented these breast cancers and we didn\'t,"" says Kaklamani.\n\nFor Toby, it\'s been about a year since her double mastectomy. She\'s had reconstruction. And, today, she says she feels physically strong again. But she now feels an emotional empowerment, and that comforts her.\n\n""My mother left me when I was 26, and it was extremely painful and traumatic for my entire life,"" she says. ""I just didn\'t want to do that for my children. I had a chance to control that and to fight what my mother never had a chance for.""\n\nOncologist Kaklamani says women with the BRCA mutation should be counseled about genetic testing, and strongly consider it.\n\nWhile surgical decisions are up to patients, the findings of this study should help them decide what to do, she says.\n\nToby has a daughter who decided to take the test, based on her mother\'s experience. She tested negative, Toby says.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The framing of a story like this is so important.  This story’s frame was imbalanced.  And we criticize its inaccuracies and lack of completeness. </span>","1clip_filelist.xml""/>



 
We acknowledge that this is a complex issue.  But this is a topic that demands that news organizations rise to the challenge. 
This story emphasizes the potential benefits of preventive surgery for women who have a high risk of cancer related to BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations. It doesn’t mention any of the harm even though the consequences of treatment led the majority of women in this study to opt not to have the surgery. The story contains factual errors and misstatements that undermine its credibility.  It was the second weakest of four we reviewed on this study. 
This story was reviewed by two journalists and one expert in breast cancer decision support.

Nothing worked. Five months ago he tried something new: a stomach pacemaker that curbed his appetite.\n\nSince having it implanted, Hetzner, a 20-year-old Munich mailman, has knocked off more than 10 kilos (22 pounds) from his earlier weight of 104 kilos (229 pounds).\n\nHetzner got the device as part of a clinical trial. Since being approved by Britain last month, the device is available for sale across the European Union. It works a bit like a cardiac pacemaker, and consists of a stimulator and a sensor surgically implanted onto the stomach.\n\nThe stimulator sends out electrical pulses meant to trick the stomach and brain into thinking the body is full. Hetzner said the pulses kick in a few minutes after he starts eating or drinking. He said they make him feel full after finishing about half the amount of food he would normally eat.\n\n""It feels like a little pressure on my stomach or a tickle, but it\'s not a bad feeling,"" he said in a telephone interview.\n\n""It\'s been like a little guide to help me change my life,"" he said.\n\nSo far, about 65 patients in two studies have received the device from U.S. pacemaker manufacturer Intrapace. Only about half of those have had the pacemaker for at least a year, and most lost about 20 percent of their weight and kept it off.\n\nOther stomach pacemakers are on the market but most are used to relieve symptoms like nausea and vomiting, not to fight obesity.\n\nAppetite is partly controlled by signals sent from nerves around the stomach to the brain; the stomach pacemaker taps into that communication system, sending a message to the brain that the body is full after a relatively small amount of food is consumed.\n\n""If you can stimulate the nerves going from the stomach to the brain, that should indeed have an effect in reducing food intake,"" said Stephen Bloom, an obesity expert at Imperial College in London, who is not connected to Intrapace or the clinical trials.\n\nBloom, however, questioned whether the device would work long-term, as people might eventually get used to the electrical pulses and keep eating anyway.\n\nDoctors familiar with the pacemaker say there will always be ways for patients to eat and work around the system. ""We could make the (stomach pacemaker) work so people feel like they\'re going to throw up, but we don\'t want that,"" said Thomas Horbach, chief of surgery at Stadtkrankenhaus Schwabach, near Munich, who led one of the trials.\n\n""If you take away all the responsibilities from the patient, they will not change on their own.""\n\nAs an additional benefit, the sensor tracks when patients eat, drink or exercise, so patients can chart their progress. Intrapace has also created an online network for patients to trade weight loss advice and share experiences.\n\nOther surgical approaches to weight loss come with serious side effects.\n\nPeople who have their stomach stapled or have a gastric band must eat smaller amounts of mostly low-fat foods, because their stomachs can\'t accommodate or process large volumes. If they overeat, they will feel nauseous, vomit, or suffer from other problems.\n\nThe most serious side effect seen in the pacemaker has been an infection linked to surgery. In Britain, the pacemaker costs about 15,000 pounds ($24,040), including the keyhole surgery used to implant it. Intrapace President Chuck Brynelsen said that\'s comparable to other weight loss surgeries.\n\nThe device is authorized for sale across the EU, though the company is first targeting weight loss clinics in Britain, Germany and Spain. It also plans to submit the device for approval in the U.S. once it has more data, and hopes it will be available there in 2014.\n\nThe pacemaker hasn\'t yet been implanted commercially in Europe, but Intrapace is in talks with clinics interested in offering it.\n\nBrynelsen said the battery in the device lasts about five years and it will be up to patients how long they want to keep the pacemaker. ""We don\'t know if patients will see (the stomach pacemaker) as a bridge to recovery or whether this is a crutch they will need for the longer term,"" he said.\n\nSome experts said the pacemaker did not address people\'s underlying reasons for overeating. ""The problem with these devices is they assume people are rational and that they eat because they\'re hungry,"" said Stephan Rossner, a professor in the obesity unit at Karolinska University Hospital.\n\n""A lot of obese patients eat because they\'re depressed, they can\'t sleep at night, or they have nobody to have sex with,"" he said. ""So whatever you insert into their stomach, they can out-eat that device because it\'s other things that drive them to consume.""\n\nHetzner said he intends to keep the stomach pacemaker for about four years.\n\n""I don\'t want to backslide,"" he said, adding he would recommend the device to others. ""I want to be sure I can stick with it and that my body adapts to this new way of eating.""\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.abiliti.com/en']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story was clearly written and easy to read.

Between 1998 and 2007, 2,578 new cases of rheumatoid arthritis were identified in this group.\n\nThe analysis revealed that patients who took statins for at least eight years during the decade-long study period were roughly 40% less likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis than people who did not take statins at all or who took them less persistently.\n\nA more modest 15% reduction in osteoarthritis risk was seen in persistent statin users.

Of the two stories we reviewed that reported the findings of a study showing an association between statin use and lower rates of rheumatoid arthritis, this one does the better job highlighting the preliminary nature of the research. Comments from a researcher about the need for further study before suggesting statins as a preventive measure to fight rheumatoid arthritis appear near the top of the story. The story also includes a comment from an independent source saying this type of study cannot tell us if there is a causal relationship. Like the other story we reviewed, this one fails to make any mention of side effects or any other downside to statin use. As with the other story reviewed, a significant shortcoming of this story was the failure to put the observed difference in rheumatoid arthritis rates into perspective. The story reports those who took statins faithfully for several years had a 40 percent lower rate of developing rheumatoid arthritis. But this was 40 percent lower than what? Neither story answers that question. The American College of Rheumatology estimates that rheumatoid arthritis affects between 2 and 10.7 people per 1,000. That means you would need to treat up to 998 people with statins to eliminate one case of RA. That statistic puts the finding in a different light and should have been included.

Its results built upon exciting data it released in June — showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman’s cancer doesn’t get worse. (The study did not assess whether the drug helped women live longer, just how long it stopped tumors from growing.)\n\nA small pilot study on a drug called talazoparib, which is now owned by Pfizer (PFE), recently showed similarly compelling results.\n\nBut Colorado’s Clovis Oncology (CLVS) fared less well. Though its own PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, showed that it could help some women compared to chemotherapy alone, its data didn’t measure up to the other two trials. The company’s stock plunged 18 percent on Friday after the data were released.\n\nOne PARP inhibitor has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration: olaparib, sold by AstraZeneca (AZN) as Lynparza. It’s being used to treat ovarian cancer in women who have already undergone chemotherapy.\n\nChemotherapy deals heavy damage to tumors — but often, the cancer cells are able to regroup and repair themselves. PARP inhibitors work by stopping this repair. They’re particularly useful in treating cancers associated with the BRCA mutation, since this gene codes for proteins that help repair damaged DNA.\n\nWhile chemotherapy is still used as a first line of attack, PARP inhibitors are largely being studied as maintenance drugs. The hope is that they’ll keep cancer at bay once it’s been attacked by chemo.\n\nA number of cancers are associated with BRCA mutations — including breast, prostate, and pancreatic.\n\nMore and more clinical trials will spring up to test PARP inhibitors in combination with other cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, said Dr. Christina Annunziata, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute who studied the efficacy of Lynparza in ovarian cancer patients.\n\nThe field is so hot that over the summer, Pfizer agreed to spend an eye-popping $14 billion to buy San Francisco-based biotech Medivation. The key asset Pfizer wanted? The PARP inhibitor talazoparib. So far, there’s just extremely early data, but it looks promising. In a pilot study of 13 breast cancer patients on the drug at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, tumors shrank on average 78 percent.\n\n“We found a significant decrease in the tumors with only two months of therapy,” said Dr. Jennifer Litton, the lead investigator. She’s launching a larger trial for further study.\n\nAs for Tesaro, it first shared initial data from a Phase 3 clinical trial this past June. It showed that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the drug got an extra 15 months without their disease getting worse, compared to a control group. At the European conference this weekend, Tesaro added a few more details to that data:\n\nThe study looked at 553 patients whose cancer responds to a certain type of chemotherapy, known as platinum chemo. The best results came from patients with the BRCA mutation: Their tumors didn’t start to grow again for 21 months, on average, compared to 5.5 months for a control group that just received a placebo. Other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups.\n\nThe results were published this weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration granted Tesaro’s drug fast-track approval status — and this new data will support its registration applications to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, Tesaro CEO Lonnie Moulder said. The company is now planning trials in lung cancer, and is considering other cancers to pursue.\n\n“In the field, these would be described as landmark results,” Moulder said. “At this time, there’s nothing available that has been approved by regulatory agencies for these women who have recurrence to their ovarian cancer.”\n\nBy comparison, Clovis Oncology has floundered.\n\nThe company aims to use its PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, to treat only patients with BRCA mutations who have had two or more chemotherapies. But the data it presented at the European conference showed that the drug may not actually be more effective than Lynparza, the PARP inhibitor that’s been marketed by AstraZeneca since 2014.\n\nThe study’s lead investigator, Rebecca Kristeleit, defended the performance of rucaparib, adding that one can’t compare Clovis’s drug to Tesaro’s: “It’s a completely different population, and a different use of the drugs,” she said.\n\nBecause early symptoms are fairly benign — bloating and back pain — about 75 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer don’t learn they have it until it has progressed to stage 3. About 22,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, and about 15,000 women die of the disease each year in the United States.']","Do we really need more PARP inhibitors beyond the one that’s already approved? If so, why? This story didn’t clarify these things for readers.","This story from STAT focuses on a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors that interfere with the repair of DNA in cancer cells that have been damaged by chemotherapy.
While the story suggests these drugs under development will be new weapons for use against the disease, it offers scant real information about the drugs’ successes and what makes them unique and needed compared to the one already-approved PARP inhibitor. It also didn’t discuss costs and side effects–two very vital details for readers.

It affects about 700,000 Americans, according to the Crohn\'s and Colitis Foundation (CCF).\n\nThe illness causes inflammation, irritation, swelling and sores on the lining of the large intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea with blood or pus and abdominal discomfort, according to CCF.\n\n""There is still a substantial unmet need for new treatments for patients with ulcerative colitis,"" said study lead author Dr. William Sandborn. He is professor of medicine and chief of the division of gastroenterology at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nXeljanz targets certain proteins involved in the body\'s inflammatory and immune responses that other so-called biologic drugs don\'t, the researchers said.\n\n""Treatment with oral tofacitinib is potentially a new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, pending review by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],"" Sandborn said.\n\nThe study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Sandborn said he has received research grants from the company and served as a consultant for Pfizer.\n\nWhether Xeljanz should be used as a first treatment is still not clear, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nBecause Xeljanz comes as a pill, it could have an advantage for patients, Swaminath said. But so far it has only been tried with patients who have not responded to other treatments, he said.\n\n""How it is used in the real world may be different than how it was used in these studies,"" Swaminath said. ""I am not going out on a limb and say this should be the first choice, because we don\'t have enough data to say that\'s the way it should be positioned.""\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned more than 1,700 people with ulcerative colitis to one of three phase 3 trials.\n\nThe first two trials looked at more than 1,100 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who had failed with conventional treatment or treatment with newer ""tumor necrosis factor antagonist"" drugs, such as Remicade (infliximab). They received Xeljanz or a placebo twice a day for eight weeks.\n\nIn the third trial, nearly 600 patients who responded to Xeljanz were assigned to a maintenance dose (one group with 5 milligrams [mg] and another group with 10 mg) of the drug, or placebo for a year.\n\nIn the first trial, nearly 19 percent of the patients taking Xeljanz experienced a remission of their condition in eight weeks. That compared to just 8 percent of patients receiving placebo.\n\nIn the second trial, almost 17 percent of those taking Xeljanz had a remission, compared with nearly 4 percent of those taking placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn the third trial, more than 34 percent of patients taking 5 mg of Xeljanz had disease remission after one year. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. Only 11 percent of patients on placebo saw a remission.\n\nHowever, in all of the trials, more patients taking Xeljanz suffered from infections, such as shingles, than those receiving placebo, researchers found.\n\nIn addition, five patients taking Xeljanz developed nonmelanoma skin cancer, compared with one patient receiving placebo. Five patients taking the drug experienced heart problems compared with no one on the placebo.\n\nAlso, compared with placebo, Xeljanz was associated with an increase in levels of cholesterol.\n\nThe report was published May 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDr. Sonia Friedman is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. She\'s also the author of an editorial accompanying the study.\n\n""Tofacitinib is a promising new class of medical therapy that has efficacy in ulcerative colitis. It is an oral, small-molecule drug that is different from current biologic therapies, such as infliximab [Remicade], adalimumab [Humira], golimumab [Simponi] and vedolizumab [Entyvio],"" Friedman said.\n\nAn advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. Other biologic drugs are given by infusion or injection. In addition, patients cannot develop antibodies to Xeljanz as they can with other biologic drugs, Friedman said.\n\n""Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics,"" she said. ""Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on ulcerative colitis, visit the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.']",All it was missing was the cost of the drug.,"The story reports on a journal article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), regarding several clinical trials that found the arthritis drug tofacitinib (marketed under the name Xeljanz) was an effective treatment for ulcerative colitis in some patients.
The story does a good job of describing the trials, the potential benefits, and the potential side effects associated with Xeljanz use for ulcerative colitis — and makes clear that it is likely too soon to tell whether Xeljanz will be used as a first treatment for the disease. However, the story does not address the cost of the drug, which is considerable.
One thing that weakened the story: It speculates too much on the implications of the study before describing any aspect of the study itself.

""A diet containing tomatoes... a few times a week would be good for our health. However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection.""\n\n\n\nKarppi says it\'s the chemical lycopene that gives tomatoes and other fruits/vegetables their rich red color, that is helping to protect the brain. Tomatoes are particularly high in the powerful antioxidant that acts like a sponge, soaking up rogue molecules called free radicals that if left unchecked can damage cells.\n\nThe study\n\nResearchers tested the level of lycopene in the blood of more than 1,000 Finnish men aged 46 to 65, starting in 1991. Scientists then followed the men on average for more than a decade to record the number who had strokes.\n\nThe scientists found that those with the highest levels of lycopene were 55% less likely to have a stroke than those with the lowest amounts in their blood.\n\nCaveats\n\nThough the study looks promising, experts say that we can\'t necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene.\n\n""It\'s a compelling study and it fits with other data that we have about risk of stroke and vegetable and fruit consumption,"" explains Dr. Daniel Labovitz, director of the Stern Stroke Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. ""But it\'s not proof that if you eat tomatoes you\'re going to have less risk of stroke.""\n\nLabovitz also points out that the group of men who had fewer strokes were younger, had lower blood pressure and smoked less than the group more prone to stroke. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes.\n\nIn other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes.\n\nMore on lycopene\n\nLycopene has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it\'s such a powerful antioxidant. If we don\'t eat enough lycopene-packed foods, experts suspect too many free radicals get left in the body, damaging blood vessels by helping to form fatty deposits. When these deposits build up, a blockage forms. If that vessel is in the brain, the blockage can cause a stroke.\n\nBut the foods we eat are complex and filled with many nutrients, making it tough to prove what is really providing benefits.\n\n""Eating tomatoes is a good thing, but we don\'t know if there is really anything unique about tomatoes apart from other fruits and vegetables that reduce stroke risk,"" explains Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nTomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is major risk factor for stroke.\n\nTake home message\n\nSo are lycopene packed tomatoes really the magic fruit? It seems the jury is still out, but researchers suggest we eat healthy as they continue to search for answers.\n\n""This is one more reason to consume fruits and vegetables - at least 5 a day - and it\'s good to include tomatoes in that mix,"" Willett said.']",This otherwise well-reported story fell into some of the obvious traps we implore journalists to avoid. It still managed to best the competing coverage from the ,"This story about lycopene for the prevention of stroke had two glaring problems: It provided relative instead of absolute risk numbers, and had a headline that was more forceful than the underlying evidence can support.

And those in the top fifth of fiber intake were 11 percent less likely to do so than women in the bottom fifth.\n\nThat was after accounting for differences in risk factors like alcohol drinking, weight, hormone replacement therapy and family members with the disease.\n\nStill, it’s impossible to rule out that big fiber eaters had healthier habits overall that would cut their risk, Jia-Yi Dong of Soochow University in Suzhou and his colleagues write in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\n\nAnd the potential effect was “very small,” Dr. Eleni Linos of Stanford University, who wasn’t involved in the research, told Reuters Health in an email.\n\nAbout one in eight American women get breast cancer at some point, with less than a quarter of them dying from it.\n\nAlthough the connection between breast cancer risk and fiber is a small one, fiber is “something that we know is healthy for you anyway,” said Christina Clarke, a research scientist at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California in Fremont.\n\nKnown benefits of a high-fiber diet include lower cholesterol and weight loss. If it turns out to cut cancer risk as well, that would be an extra bonus, Clarke said.\n\nFruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are all high in fiber.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2010 Dietary Guidelines, most Americans don’t get enough fiber. The guidelines recommend that women eat 25 grams of fiber per day and men eat 38 grams, while the average Americans gets just 15 grams a day.\n\n“Increasing dietary fiber intake in the general public is of great public health significance,” the Chinese team concludes.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/qKtsU2 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, online July 20, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">In less than 500 words, this story covered a big study but drove home the limitations of its findings. </span>","It’s not often you see a story that so simply explains possible confounders in research.  This story hammered the point:

So it\'s routine for patients to take clot-preventing drugs for some time afterward.\n\nSome doctors choose powerful anti-clotting drugs like heparin (Lovenox) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), but it hasn\'t been clear whether these expensive prescription drugs work any better than cheap, readily available aspirin.\n\n""Aspirin alone may provide similar protection compared to anticoagulation treatments,"" says Brian R. Hallstrom, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon and associate chair for quality and safety at the University of Michigan Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nHallstrom is the lead author of a new study published in JAMA Surgery that found few patients developed a blood clot after surgery, and those patients on aspirin fared just as well as those on anticoagulants.\n\nAspirin use growing\n\nDuring the two-year study period from 2013 to 2015, aspirin use rose from 10 percent to 50 percent among the patients cared for by orthopaedic surgeons in the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative, a statewide effort to give patients the best possible recovery and outcomes after hip and knee replacements.\n\nSince then, the shift has become even more distinct: Aspirin prescribing has risen to 70 percent among Michigan surgeons, says Hallstrom, who is co-director of the initiative and a health services researcher at U-M\'s Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.\n\nBased on the experience of 41,537 Michigan patients undergoing knee replacement, the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention.\n\nA recent Canadian study looked at the issue, but the analysis had a caveat: Each of the more than 3,400 clinical trial patients received rivaroxaban the first five days after surgery. After that, they continued with the drug or switched to aspirin.\n\nThe new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one.\n\n""This study is truly a real-world experience of what happened in Michigan when the majority of surgeons switched to aspirin,"" Hallstrom says. ""The incidence of blood clots, pulmonary embolus and death did not increase despite this dramatic change in practice.""\n\nShifting procedure and dialogue\n\nOver the past decade, surgeons have turned away from powerful anticoagulants and toward aspirin used in addition to nondrug improvements such as compression devices for thwarting clots.\n\nThese days, most patients have a generally low risk of blood clots after knee replacement for a number of reasons. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. Some patients are even going home the same day.\n\n""The most important way to prevent blood clots is getting moving,"" says Hallstrom, noting that people are at risk for blood clots when they sit or lie in one position for too long, such as on an airplane or a hospital bed.\n\nStill, pharmaceutical recommendations vary.\n\nThe critical care specialists who make up the American College of Chest Physicians favor heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots, while the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines state that no one drug is better than another for preventing clots.\n\nAdvantages of aspirin\n\nThe U-M study involved patients undergoing knee replacement surgery at any of the 29 Michigan hospitals in the surgical quality group. One-third of the patients took aspirin alone; 54 percent took only an anticoagulant; and 13 percent took an aspirin/anticoagulant combination.\n\nOver three months, just 1.16 percent of aspirin patients developed a serious blood clot. That was true for 1.42 percent of anticoagulant patients, according to the Michigan study. This was not statistically different.\n\nSo, neither drug appeared better than the other -- but aspirin has some obvious advantages.\n\n""Aspirin is easy to take and much less expensive,"" Hallstrom says. ""Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive.""\n\nThe reported cost for a 30-day supply of rivaroxaban is approximately $379 to $450; heparin is estimated at $450 to $890. Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.\n\nIn contrast, aspirin costs approximately $2 a month.\n\nThe study suggests most patients can have just aspirin without increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism, but doctors need to consider factors such as a patient\'s history of clots, obesity and ability to mobilize after surgery when determining the best measure for clot prevention, Hallstrom adds.\n\n###']","Harms from aspirin, including bleeding risk, were not mentioned.","It is certainly welcome news when a study reports that a cheaper, over-the-counter drug produces results about the same as more expensive prescription drugs that are generally trickier to use. However, this release about aspirin performing about the same as anticoagulant drugs for preventing blood clots in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery implies that “good old aspirin” is essentially without risks. The release neglects to tell readers about important limitations of the study, and its description of key aspects of the study is a bit muddled. The release does clearly point out the price differences between the drugs studied.

Doctors typically gauge such illnesses based on self-reported symptoms and behavior.\n\nNow, a new study shows that a kind of brain scan called functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) - which shows how brain regions interact - can reliably detect fundamental differences in how individual brains are wired. As such, the technique potentially could be used to distinguish healthy people from people with brain diseases or disorders, and provide insight into variations in cognitive ability and personality traits.\n\nThe findings are published April 18 in Neuron.\n\n""This is a step toward realizing the clinical promise of functional connectivity MRI,"" said senior author Steven Petersen, PhD, the James S. McDonnell Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in Neurology and a professor of neurosurgery, of biomedical engineering, of psychological and brain sciences, and of radiology. ""Before we can develop diagnostic tests based on fcMRI, we need to know what it is actually measuring. We show here that it\'s not measuring what you\'re thinking, but how your brain is organized. That opens the door to an entire new field of clinical testing.""\n\nPetersen, postdoctoral researcher and first author Caterina Gratton, PhD, and colleagues analyzed a set of data collected by the Midnight Scan Club, a group of Washington University scientists who took turns undergoing myriad scans in an MRI machine late at night, when the demand for such machines and, consequently, the usage fees tend to be low.\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcMRI scans on each of nine people, collected in 10 separate one-hour sessions for each person. During the scans, each person performed tasks related to vision, memory, reading or motor skills, or rested quietly.\n\nFunctional MRI scans generate a dynamic map of the outer surface of the brain, showing changing hot spots of activity over time. To create a functional connectivity map, Gratton divided the brain\'s surface into 333 regions and identified areas that became active and inactive in unison. She then constructed brain network maps for each individual, showing patterns of correlation between parts of the brain.\n\nThe sheer quantity of data available on each person allowed her to analyze how much an individual\'s brain networks changed from day to day and with different mental tasks.\n\nThe answer? Not much.\n\n""Brain networks captured by fcMRI are really about the individual,"" Gratton said. ""Whether someone\'s watching a movie or thinking about her breakfast or moving her hands makes only a small difference. You can still identify that individual by her brain networks with a glance.""\n\nThe consistency of the fcMRI scans makes them a promising diagnostic tool. Although the technique\'s potential to identify brain disorders and diseases was noted years ago, fcMRI-based diagnostic tests have yet to make their way into doctors\' offices. Progress has been stymied by confusion over whether the scans reflect fundamental, stable features of the brain, or if they change with every passing thought.\n\nFurther, the researchers found that the technique was powerful enough to distinguish people who were extraordinarily alike. All of the scanned brains belonged to young, healthy scientists and doctors.\n\n""We need more data before we can know what is normal variation in the population at large,"" Gratton said. ""But the individual differences were really easy to pick up, even in a population that is really very similar. It\'s exciting to think that these individual differences may be related to personality, cognitive ability, or psychiatric or neurological disease. Thanks to this work, we know we have a reliable tool to study these possibilities.""\n\n###']",This release suggests that it’s possible to use an fMRI brain scan to diagnose diseases  or conditions. That is very premature. Diagnostic tests have yet to be developed.,"This news release reports findings from a study of functional MRI (fcMRI) scans in which researchers analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcMRI scans on each of nine people. During the scans, each person performed a variety of tasks to determine the extent to which their behaviors altered the picture of their brain activity. The researchers found that each person’s brain imaging changed little from day-to-day or task-to-task. That is, the brain scans appeared to reflect fundamental, stable features of the brain. The release suggests that, based on these findings, its possible to use this type of brain scan to diagnose individual traits or diseases. That is very premature. Diagnostic tests have yet to be developed.
The release headline promises more than the news release delivers, and there’s a real question as to whether this information is useful to the public, or just misleading.

Here's what the science says.,"['Welcome to Dear Julia, a weekly column where readers can submit everyday health questions on anything from the science of hangovers to the mysteries of back pain. Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.\n\nHave a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nIs running really a better form of exercise than walking, given that running can lead to more injuries?\n\nAt Vox, I sit near health reporter Sarah Kliff, who trains for half-marathons and triathlons with a casualness most people reserve for grocery shopping. But Sarah’s also suffered with plantar fasciitis and a stress fracture. At times, she\'s hobbled around in running shoes for months because everything else hurt too much, and even sported a big blue brace on her left leg to help cushion the tiny cracks in the bones of her foot brought on from too much wear and tear.\n\nIn many ways, Sarah is a perfect case study in how to think about the benefits and risks of running versus walking. Running has greater health benefits than walking (Sarah is super fit), but it also carries a much bigger risk of injury (see Sarah’s foot brace).\n\n\n\nSo which effect dominates? To find out, I first searched for ""randomized control trials"" and ""systematic reviews"" on running, walking, and exercise at PubMed health (a free search engine for health research) and in Google Scholar. I wanted to see what the highest-quality evidence — trials and reviews are the gold standard — said about the relative risks and benefits of these two forms of exercise.\n\nIt was immediately apparent that running can lead to more injuries, and the risk goes up as running programs get more intense. Studies have found that runners have significantly higher injury rates than walkers (one study found that young men who run or jog had a 25 percent higher risk of injuries than walkers), and that ultramarathoners are at an even greater risk. The main running-related injuries include tibia stress syndrome, Achilles tendon injuries, and plantar fasciitis.\n\nOverall, more than half of people who run will experience some sort of injury from doing so, while the percentage of walkers who will get hurt is around 1 percent. Interestingly, it seems you can walk pretty much endlessly without any increased risk of hurting yourself.\n\nThat running hurts people shouldn\'t be surprising. As this study described, ""Running produces ground reaction forces that are approximately 2.5 times body weight, while the ground reaction force during walking is in the range of 1.2 times body weight."" You\'re also more likely to trip and fall while running than you are during a walk.\n\nJogging even 5 to 10 minutes per day can reduce the risk of death from all causes I also learned about some of the incredible health benefits of going fast: Even five to 10 minutes per day of jogging at around 6 miles per hour can reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and other causes. Joggers have been found to live longer than non-joggers even after adjusting for other factors — a difference of 3.8 years for men and 4.7 years for women.\n\nThat said, research has found that walking carries significant health benefits, as well. Some studies suggest that you can extend your life and stave off disease by simply walking — and the more, the better.\n\nAll this research, while illuminating, didn’t offer up any clear conclusions on whether running or walking was better for you overall. So I asked some of the world’s leading researchers in this area. Their conclusion? You need to consider the trade-offs.\n\n""Running moderately prolongs life more than walking does,"" said Peter Schnohr, a clinical cardiologist who has researched many aspects of exercise and health. The key word there is ""moderately."" Schnohr warned of the emerging research that doing a lot of endurance exercise over the long term (like triathlon training) can lead to heart problems. Overall, there\'s a U-shaped association between running and mortality, he said. Too little isn\'t helpful for health, but too much might be harmful.\n\n\n\n""The most favorable regimen is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace""\n\n""The most favorable [regimen] is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace,"" Schnohr advised. ""Running every day, at a fast speed, more than 4 hours per week is not as favorable."" And for those who don\'t like running, he noted, ""Fast walking, not slow, also prolongs life. I can’t tell how much.""\n\nDutch researcher Luiz Carlos Hespanhol pointed out that in general, running simply delivers health benefits more efficiently than walking does. This study, for example, found that five minutes of running per day is as beneficial as 15 minutes of walking. Hespanhol also said that after one year of training just two hours a week, runners lose weight, reduce their body fat, lower their resting heart rates, and drive down their blood serum triglycerides (fat in the blood). There\'s even evidence that running can have positive effects on tension, depression, and anger.\n\nEven so, Hespanhol wasn\'t a total cheerleader for running. A good walking regimen can have similar benefits, he noted. So on running versus walking, it really depends on your values and preferences: ""One could choose walking instead of running as a mode of physical activity based on injury risks, since walking is less risky than running,"" he explained. Or alternatively: ""One could choose running because the health benefits are larger and come faster, in a shorter period of time.""\n\nTo recap: Running improves your health more efficiently than walking does and has greater health benefits per time invested. But even a small amount of running carries more injury risk than walking. And a lot of running (i.e., ultramarathon training) can well be harmful, while the same is never true for walking.\n\nWhere does this leave us? All the exercise researchers seemed to agree on one thing: that the best exercise routine is the one you\'ll actually do. So the answer to the running versus walking question will probably vary from person to person. If you prefer one over the other, stick with that. And if you still can\'t decide, Hespanhol suggested this: ""Why not do both — running and walking — in order to get the best of each?""\n\nSend your questions to Julia via the submission form or @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.

The ability to accurately locate the cancers helps physicians make better and earlier diagnoses—and may eventually make possible targeted nuclear-medicine therapies that identify and kill cancer cells, but not the surrounding healthy cells.\n\nThis summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved two such tests—one can trace slow-growing prostate cancer cells, while the other targets a rare condition where neuroendocrine cells develop into tumors. Advanced Accelerator Applications, a French pharmaceutical company that developed the test for neuroendocrine tumors, also is seeking approval for a drug called Lutathera that uses the same technique to zero in on the cancer that needs treating, says Chief Executive Stefano Buono.\n\nFinding the fuel\n\nDeveloped in the 1970s, nuclear imaging is used to reveal the body’s metabolic activities (in contrast with static imaging, such as X-rays, which provide just a snapshot). Positron emission tomography, or PET, scans can be used to identify many common cancers, as well as Alzheimer’s and epilepsy.\n\nBut many PET scans aren’t effective at locating certain cancers, including cancer of the prostate, the third most common type of cancer in the U.S., with more than 180,000 new cases and more than 26,000 deaths expected this year. That’s because the most common imaging agent, known as FDG, uses glucose to locate cancer cells. Prostate and several other cancers don’t use as much glucose, so the scans aren’t effective for those diseases.\n\nThe new tests pair radioactive materials with a receptor that reacts to a hormone for neuroendocrine tumors or, in the case of prostate cancer, amino acid, which is what fuels the disease. The result is a better view of the cancer.\n\nSpotting a relapse\n\nBlue Earth Diagnostics Ltd., based in Oxford, England, developed the prostate imaging agent, called Axumin, based on a molecule originally developed by Mark Goodman, a professor of radiology and imaging sciences at Emory University’s School of Medicine in the mid-1990s. The agent was administered commercially for the first time in September at a hospital in Atlanta.\n\nWith recurrent prostate cancer, the test’s ability to locate cancer at the cellular level means that it can complement current diagnostic tests.\n\nProstate-specific antigen, or PSA, is the common way to screen for the disease. But it isn’t entirely reliable because the PSA protein count also rises with age and disease of the prostate like inflammation, and it doesn’t help to determine the location of the tumor. That can be crucial in deciding on treatment. If the cancer is confined to the pelvis, surgery or radiation can be used to treat the disease. But if it has spread to lymph nodes or the bones, hormone therapy may be required.\n\nThe test also allows for earlier detection of recurrent disease. An estimated 20% to 30% of men who are treated for prostate cancer will relapse after five years, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation.\n\n“The new scan can detect cancer with a relatively low PSA count, say, under 5, when the cancer may still be curable,” says Mark Scholz, founder and executive director of the non-profit Prostate Cancer Research Institute. “That changes everything.”\n\nThere are other efforts seeking to screen for cancer on a cellular level. Genetic testing, for example, looks for inherited mutations in a person’s genes to gauge the risk of developing hereditary cancer, and allow patients to be on guard even before any symptoms appear. Still, nuclear imaging can provide complementary information to these newer methods. For one, nuclear imaging can see how the tumor behaves in the body and its immediate environment and can be used to inform physicians about changes in the disease during the course of treatment, says Dr. Janet Eary, a deputy associate director at the National Cancer Institute’s cancer-imaging program.\n\nMs. Or is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York. She can be reached at amy.or@wsj.com.']","The story keeps expectations in check, but needed a discussion around what the clinical evidence shows for these tests.","This story summarizes the incremental benefits of two FDA-approved and relatively recent commercially available nuclear imaging tests designed to diagnosis prostate cancer and a rare neuroendocrine tumor earlier and more accurately. The imaging technologies in the piece have been the subject  of recent corporate press releases and FDA announcements, and the article makes the most of the opportunity to fill in useful context about the comparative benefits of tweaked nuclear imaging capabilities vs other screening and diagnostic/prognostic testing.
The story focuses mostly on the prostate cancer test, and generally avoids hyperbole and does an overall good job of keeping expectations for the new tests in check. That said, the story would have been strengthened by having a comment from a front-line prostate cancer clinician or general oncologist, especially to weigh in on what the data shows. That’s because the story was lacking in quantitative data from studies demonstrating the tests’ accuracy, benefits and limits.

Medicaid patients in Oregon are receiving the treatment, and at least 18 dental schools have started teaching the next generation of pediatric dentists how to use it.\n\nDr. Richard Niederman, the chairman of the epidemiology and health promotion department at the New York University College of Dentistry, said, “Being able to paint it on in 30 seconds with no noise, no drilling, is better, faster, cheaper.”\n\n“I would encourage parents to ask for it,” he added. “It’s less trauma for the kid.”\n\nThe main downside is aesthetic: Silver diamine fluoride blackens the brownish decay on a tooth. That may not matter on a back molar or a baby tooth that will fall out, but some patients are likely to be deterred by the prospect of a dark spot on a visible tooth.\n\nUntil more insurers cover it, patients also have to cover the cost. Still, it’s relatively inexpensive. Dr. Michelle Urschel, an anesthesiologist, was happy to pay $25 to have Dr. Jeanette MacLean, a pediatric dentist in Glendale, Ariz., paint over a cavity that her son Knox, 4, had recently developed.']","As with medical stories, it’s vital that dental stories take a look at the research/evidence for a particular intervention and discuss it with readers, and this one didn’t.","The story focuses on the use of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) to treat and prevent dental cavities, particularly in children. The story does a good job of addressing cost, discussing benefits in context, and drawing on input from a variety of independent sources.
But the article seems to be somewhat one sided, praising the therapy much more strongly than discussing the downsides of the treatment or the potential need for ongoing repeat treatment. And it sidesteps a solid discussion of what the medical evidence says about SDF.
As well, we found this headline problematic. “A cavity-fighting liquid lets kids avoid dentists’ drills.” Yes, SDF could help many kids avoid dentists’ drills for some cavities– but, due to lack of availability, a lot of kids won’t be able to use SDF, and even kids who can use SDF won’t be able to use it if they have particularly large cavities. “A cavity-fighting liquid lets some kids avoid dentists’ drills” would have been more accurate and informative.

It also doesn\'t change the very limited treatment choices.\n\nBut the new criteria, which were developed by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\'s Association, are almost guaranteed to prompt confusion, even in people who are thinking quite clearly.\n\nFor research, there\'s a lot of value. For everyday clinical use, very very little.\n\nThe guidelines say, for instance, that newly developed ""biomarker"" tests, such as assays for proteins in spinal fluid, and some specialized brain scans can be used for early diagnosis of Alzheimer\'s. But, the guidelines say, the tests are to be used only for research, and not for diagnosing Alzheimer\'s in the general public.\n\nThe distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. ""You don\'t need a biomarker test"" for everyday clinical practice, says David Knopman, a professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic, who was co-chairman of the group that revised the dementia diagnosis. The existing tests for Alzheimer\'s are adequate, he says. And those biomarkers? ""It\'s in the fine print, but it definitely says in multiple places that the biomarkers are for research purposes.""\n\nWhy? Well, the biomarker tests and PET scans aren\'t yet accurate enough to reliably diagnose Alzheimer\'s, and haven\'t been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And it\'s also because there are no treatments that can prevent, slow or stop early signs of Alzheimer\'s.\n\n""For research, there\'s a lot of value,"" Knopman says. ""For everyday clinical use, very very little.""\n\nAbout 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\'s. The hallmark signs are problems with thinking, learning, and memory. The current definition, created in 1984, describes Alzheimer\'s that way. But over the past few years there\'s been solid evidence that Alzheimer\'s starts damaging the brain years before a person starts having noticeable problems thinking. Scientists have been putting a lot of effort into trying to identify what starts the disease process, but have so far come up empty.\n\nThe new definitions, which were just published online by the journal Alzheimer\'s & Dementia, acknowledge this dimly understood early phase of Alzheimer\'s. Now there are two new pre-dementia phases: mild cognitive impairment and ""preclinical Alzheimer\'s.""\n\nIn mild cognitive impairment, a person\'s changes in thinking are noticeable to himself, friends, or family. They would show up on tests of memory and recall, but don\'t interfere with everyday activities. Alzheimer\'s is just one possible cause. Because there are no treatments to prevent or stop Alzheimer\'s, many people may not consider this diagnosis a blessing.\n\nThe second new phase, preclinical Alzheimer\'s, is much squishier. There\'s no list of symptoms that a doctor can whip out to say you\'ve got it. Rather, the goal in creating this category is to see if scientists can define when the disease starts, and track it through biomarker tests, brain imaging, or other yet-to-be-invented tests. If that happens, it might someday lead to ways to prevent Alzheimer\'s. But for now this category is useful only to researchers.\n\nThe goal in all this, according to the Alzheimer\'s Association, is to increase opportunities for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The problem is that there aren\'t yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The new criteria are really a call for more research — and the money to fund it. That would be good for the Alzheimer\'s Association and the National Institute on Aging, which sponsored the work on the new criteria.\n\nAnd it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of ""preclinical Alzheimer\'s,"" when science and medicine can\'t offer anything to ease those fears.']","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Too often stories about tests for Alzheimer’s disease gloss over uncertainties and limitations, so it is heartening to see a news report that (like the AP story we also reviewed) tells readers the stark reality: the lab tests and brain scans in development are far from ready for clinical use and even if diagnosis were simpler, it won’t really be useful until effective treatments are developed.</span>","



This story serves readers by acknowledging the news about revised definitions for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis can be confusing… and for highlighting the potential to sow worry about “preclinical Alzheimer’s”.
A shortcoming of this story (also shared by the AP version) is the failure to tell readers about the ties between experts on the guideline panel and companies that are developing tests and treatments for Alzheimer’s.

""It took a further six months before it was possible to vaccinate a large number of people.\n\n""With this type of vaccine, you would at least be able to start using the vaccine as soon as you knew a new pandemic was starting. You could stockpile the vaccine and wouldn\'t have this wait to make a new pandemic-specific vaccine,"" she said.\n\nThe vaccine would be an important step in treating seasonal flu, not just pandemics.\n\n""Flu kills every year. It\'s not just swine flu. Normally it\'s the very old or very young that die from flu, but every year there are deaths from influenza A,"" said Gilbert.\n\nIn the U.S alone it\'s believed about 36,000 people die from seasonal flu-related causes in an average year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe initial results are positive, says Peter Palese, professor and chair of microbiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, but more research is needed before the new treatment is approved.\n\n""I think it\'s a very interesting and very elegant approach and the data so far looks very, very good,"" he said.\n\n""But although the vaccine has been give to humans, unfortunately there is no evidence presented to say if it really results in protection against infection.""\n\nGilbert agrees more work is required before the vaccine becomes available, estimating a wait of at least five year, but says the results are a fundamental next step in the treatment of flu.\n\n""It\'s fairly certain flu vaccines are going to change a lot in the next few years,"" she said.\n\n""Whether it\'s this vaccine or another one someone else develops, I don\'t think we\'ll be continuing with the type of flu vaccines that we have at the moment.""']",Wavers in describing presumed benefits. On the one hand saying “…the method is effective…first successful trial… initial results are positive…” But later: “…there is no evidence presented to say if it really results in protection against infection…” Readers get an incomplete and puzzling picture.,"The story attempts to present the results of a phase 1 trial of a new approach to a flu vaccine. But it unfortunately falls well short of ideal. Suggesting the new vaccine target flu virus proteins and the existing vaccine attacks others is simply not correct. Vaccines activate portions of the immune system. The fact that the virus used in the new vaccine is a dramatically attenuated cousin of the smallpox virus is missed entirely as was the study design and outcomes. While the story did point out the vaccine was a long way off from availability, the limitations of the approach were not discussed in any detail.

""By helping others, participants are helping themselves in ways beyond just feeding their souls. They are helping their brains. The brain shrinks as part of aging, but with this program we appear to have stopped that shrinkage and are reversing part of the aging process.""\n\nFor the study, Carlson and her colleagues randomized 111 men and women to either participate in the Experience Corps (58) or not (53). They took MRI scans of their brains at enrollment and then again after 12 and 24 months. They also conducted memory tests. Participants were an average of 67.2 years old, predominantly African-American, were in good health, came from neighborhoods with low socioeconomic status and had some college education.\n\nThe control arm of the study, those not involved in Experience Corps, exhibited age-related shrinkage in brain volumes. Typically, annual rates of atrophy in adults over age 65 range from .8 percent to two percent. The men who were enrolled in Experience Corps, however, showed a .7 percent to 1.6 percent increase in brain volumes over the course of two years. Though not statistically significant, women appeared to experience small gains, as compared to declines in the control group of one percent over 24 months.\n\nCarlson notes that many cognitive intervention studies last one year or less. One strength of this study, she says, is that the participants were followed for two years, which in this case was long enough to see changes that wouldn\'t have been detected after just one year.\n\nThe researchers were particularly interested in the results, considering that people with less education and who live in poverty are at greater risk for cognitive decline.\n\nCarlson says it\'s not entirely clear which elements of Experience Corps account for the improved memory function and increased brain volumes. She says the program increases involvement in so many different kinds of activities that retired people may not have engaged in otherwise.

We say “appears” because it’s debatable whether the study did, in fact, show any such benefits. In the results section of this study, the researchers acknowledge that their analysis of the full study sample “revealed no significant intervention effects” on brain volume. However, they highlight the findings of a “sex-stratified” analysis in the abstract that seems to indicate a benefit. But that positive result was found only in men, who comprise only about 28% of the subjects, or just 16 men in each group — a very tenuous base to support any claims of effectiveness.
A plainer way to state the findings would be that there was no significant difference between the groups overall — a simple acknowledgment that we never receive in the study abstract or the news release. Instead, the release keeps the spin cycle going by suggesting that this intervention can help “reverse part of the aging process” and “improve memory.” But no memory test results are actually reported in the study to show that there was any “improvement.” The only results provided show a correlation between brain volume and memory performance — there’s nothing to show that that the intervention itself produced a change in this outcome compared with the control group. So again, there’s a disconnect between the actual study results and what’s getting reported to the media and news consumers.

But that might be changing, at least when it comes to risk of death.\n\nThe body mass index, or BMI, associated with the lowest risk of death has increased since the 1970s, a study finds, from 23.7, in the ""normal"" weight category, to 27, which is deemed ""overweight.""\n\nThat means a person who is 5-foot-8 could weigh 180 pounds and be in that epidemiological sweet spot, according to the NIH\'s online BMI calculator. The results were published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe researchers came to that conclusion by looking at data from three studies of people in Copenhagen, one from the 1970s, one from the 1990s and one from 2003-2013. More than 100,000 people were involved. Because Denmark has an excellent national health registry, they were able to pinpoint the cause of death for every single one of those people.\n\nThe risk of death for people who are obese, with a BMI of 30 or greater, also declined, to the point that it was on a par with some people of so-called ""normal"" weight.\n\nSo being fatter, at least a bit, may be healthier.\n\n""I was surprised as a scientist to see how clear the result was,"" Borge Nordestgaard, a clinical professor and chief physician at Copenhagen University Hospital and senior author of the study, told Shots.\n\nSo he and his colleagues sliced and diced the data to see what could account for the shift. They looked at age, sex, smoking, cancer and heart disease. The most relevant was the decline in smoking since the 1970s. But when they looked at the mortality rates in nonsmokers who had never had cancer or heart disease, it also became associated with a higher BMI over time.\n\nSo what\'s going on?\n\n""Now we get into the speculation part, right? I know you journalists always want that,"" Nordestgaard says. ""One option certainly is over these three decades we have become much better at treating the cardiovascular risk factors that come with overweight and obesity.""\n\nThat includes treating high cholesterol with statins; treating high blood pressure with diet, exercise and an array of medications; and making concerted efforts to help people to control blood sugar.\n\nPeople in Denmark got heavier on average over the course of the study, as they have in the United States and most other countries. By 2013, 56 percent of the Danes had a BMI of 25 or higher. So you could think, OK, the new average is a heavier average.\n\nOr you could wonder if being a bit heavier somehow helps confer health benefits that affect longevity.\n\nResearchers have long known that people who are very thin tend to have a shorter life expectancy, often because they\'re dealing with cancer or other serious illnesses. The sweet spot on the BMI/longevity axis is typically somewhere near the middle. But there\'s not much data to back the notion that a bit more pudge is protective. ""This is total speculation,"" Nordestgaard says.\n\nThe BMI has been vilified as a poor measure of an individual\'s health. Someone who is big, fit and well-muscled, like a pro football player, can peg an obese BMI. And all of the people in this study are white, so that\'s a limitation. But the BMI, which is a general measure of body fat, has proven useful for thinking about the health of large groups of people, as in this study.\n\nNordestgaard and his colleagues are going to dig into this more in an effort to figure out what\'s going on, but he cautions that these kinds of data dives can take many months.\n\nBut this does raise the prospect of whether it may soon be time to tweak the official definition of normal, healthy weight.']","The story would have been much stronger if it had included that this finding is not new, and has been written about extensively.","This is a story looking at a data analysis of a large Danish health registry, in which researchers determined that the BMI (body-mass index) “associated with the lowest risk of death has increased … from 23.7, in the ‘normal’ weight category, to 27, which is deemed ‘overweight.'”
The story would have been much stronger if it had included that this type of finding is not new, and has been written about before and is known as the “obesity paradox.” This was an opportunity to rise above some of the criticisms leveled at journalists for simplified coverage on this topic.

Participants in short-term human trials experienced an improvement in glucose control and increased satiety, while longer-term animal trials revealed promising effects on the gut microbiota after red raspberry intake. The observations from animal and in vitro studies provided insights that support future hypotheses for red raspberry research exploring potential beneficial effects on pathways related to reducing inflammation, obesity, and type 2 diabetes risk.\n\n""We are excited about this new flurry of studies, which builds on previously published research aimed to better understand the potential health benefits of red raspberries,"" said Tom Krugman, Executive Director of the National Processed Raspberry Council (NPRC).

While this emerging research is promising, and contributes to the overall understanding of the health benefits of red raspberries, conclusions cannot be drawn at this time.\n\nBlood Sugar Control\n\nIn this human trial, investigators from the Center for Nutrition Research at the Illinois Institute of Technology looked at two study groups: obese individuals with impaired fasting glucose and hyperinsulinemia (PreDM) and healthy weight individuals with normo-glycemia and insulinemia. Participants experienced a significant reduction in postprandial glucose when 2 cups (250g) of red raspberries were consumed with meals compared to no raspberries.

In contrast, the healthy weight participants experienced significantly greater hunger suppression and wanted to eat less after a breakfast containing 2 cups (250g) of red raspberries compared to a calorie-matched control meal without raspberries.

Previous recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) had previously called for nasal sprays, or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), not be used during the 2016-2017 flu season.\n\nDr. Mark Loeb, lead author of the study, says his team\'s findings challenge the ACIP\'s recommendations towards flu shots, or inactivated vaccines.\n\n""Our study is the first blinded randomized controlled trial to compare the direct and indirect effect of the live vaccine versus the inactivated vaccine,"" said Loeb, a professor in McMaster\'s Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine.\n\n""Our results are important because in previous years the live vaccine had first been preferred for children. In fact, as late as June 2014, the live vaccine was preferred. Then, subsequently, it was no longer preferred and now not recommended at all. Our trial showed no difference between the two in protecting entire communities.""\n\nFor the study, Loeb\'s team conducted a three-year trial in a Hutterite colony, where people live communally and are relatively isolated from cities and towns, to determine whether vaccinating children and adolescents with the flu nasal spray provided better direct and community protection than the standard flu shot.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 1,186 children in 52 Hutterite colonies in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada to receive either the nasal spray vaccine or the flu shot and also followed 3,425 community members who did not receive a flu vaccine.\n\nAverage vaccine coverage among children in the nasal spray group was 76.9 per cent versus 72.3 per cent in the flu shot group.\n\nThe original intention of the study was to show that nasal spray vaccines would provide better protection than flu shots, but Loeb says the conclusions of the study are now especially important, given the ACIP\'s recommendations.\n\n""The ACIP\'s decision was an unprecedented decision in influenza vaccine policy-making for children. Our study challenges previous studies because our results show conclusively that the vaccines show similar protection when both direct and indirect effects are taken into account.""\n\nLoeb says his team will continue to study herd immunity with different vaccine formulations by vaccinating children.

However, it missed the mark when describing the effectiveness of the study. It focused on the wrong metric–the “uptake”– that is, how many people in each study group were vaccinated. Instead, we should have been informed of the main outcome of the study, which was the rates of influenza in communities vaccinated with nasal vs injected vaccine over the course of the study.

Information about the women and their mammograms came from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, funded by the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe task force says the decision to start regular, biennial mammograms before age 50 should be an individual choice based on each patient\'s situation. Meanwhile, the American Cancer Society continues to recommend that women get mammograms every year beginning at age 40.\n\nThe frequency of screening mammograms -- and the appropriate age to begin them -- has been debated since the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009 recommended that women routinely get screening mammograms every other year starting at age 50.\n\nOct. 17, 2011 -- Getting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a false alarm, a new study shows.\n\nFalse-Positives Are Common\n\nAfter 10 years of annual screening, more than half of women will be called back at least once for another mammogram. And 7% to 9% will be told they should have a biopsy because of something suspicious that turns out not to be cancer, the researchers concluded.\n\nThose false-positives may cause inconvenience and anxiety, and biopsies can cause pain and scarring, the researchers note.\n\nThey found a small but not significant increase in the chance that women diagnosed with breast cancer had a more advanced case if they underwent screening every other year instead of every year.\n\nThe study wasn\'t really designed to answer the question of which screening regimen is best, study researcher Rebecca Hubbard, PhD, says. Its main message, Hubbard says, is that call-backs (or recalls) for false-positive results are common, so women shouldn\'t panic when they occur.\n\n""In most cases, a recall doesn\'t mean you have cancer,"" says Hubbard, a biostatistician at the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. ""Hopefully, there will be less anxiety about getting a recall.""\n\nWomen can halve their risk of a call-back for a false-positive if the interpreting radiologist has previous mammograms for comparison, the researchers found.\n\nIdeally, Hubbard says, primary care doctors should talk to women about what to expect from annual and biennial screening before they get their first mammogram.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story never explained by how much the rate of false positives decreased when screening every other year rather than every year. </span>","This article reports on the results of a study of nearly 170,000 women who had screening mammograms beginning between age 40-59.  The study found that over ten years of screening mammograms, over half of the women will experience a false-positive recall for additional mammography.  In addition, 7%-9% of the women will have a biopsy for a suspicious lump which is not cancerous.
Both of those percentages decrease if the woman is screened every other year rather than every year.  Even with biennial mammography, 41% of women will experience a recall over 10 years of mammography.  The study’s Principal Investigator emphasized that “in most cases, a recall doesn’t mean you have cancer.”  She hoped this knowledge would reduce the anxiety of women who are recalled.

By looking at additional beneficial side-effects of the treatments, the researchers were able to show that there was a significant antidepressant effect from the drugs compared to a placebo based on a meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials. Meta-analyses of the other types of clinical trials showed similar results.\n\nWhen we are exposed to an infection, for example influenza or a stomach bug, our immune system fights back to control and remove the infection. During this process, immune cells flood the blood stream with proteins known as cytokines. This process is known as systemic inflammation.\n\nEven when we are healthy, our bodies carry trace levels of these proteins - known as \'inflammatory markers\' - which rise exponentially in response to infection. Previous work from the team found that children with high everyday levels of one of these markers are at greater risk of developing depression and psychosis in adulthood, suggesting a role for the immune system, particularly chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, in mental illness.\n\nInflammation can also occur as a result of the immune system mistaking healthy cells for infected cells and attacking the body, leading to autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn\'s disease. New types of anti-inflammatory drugs called anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies and cytokine inhibitors have been developed recently, some of which are now routinely used for patients who respond poorly to conventional treatments. Many more are currently undergoing clinical trials to test their efficacy and safety.\n\nThe team of researchers carried out a meta-analysis of these clinical trials and found that the drugs led to an improvement in the severity of depressive symptoms independently of improvements in physical illness. In other words, regardless of whether a drug successfully treated rheumatoid arthritis, for example, it would still help improve a patient\'s depressive symptoms. Their results are published today in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.\n\nDr Golam Khandaker, who led the study, says: ""It\'s becoming increasingly clear to us that inflammation plays a role in depression, at least for some individuals, and now our review suggests that it may be possible to treat these individuals using some anti-inflammatory drugs. These are not your everyday anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, however, but a particular new class of drugs.""\n\n""It\'s too early to say whether these anti-cytokine drugs can be used in clinical practice for depression, however,"" adds Professor Peter Jones, co-author of the study. ""We will need clinical trials to test how effective they are in patients who do not have the chronic conditions for which the drugs have been developed, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn\'s disease. On top of this, some existing drugs can have potentially serious side effects, which would need to be addressed.""\n\nDr Khandaker and colleagues believe that anti-inflammatory drugs may offer hope for patients for whom current antidepressants are ineffective. Although the trials reviewed by the team involve physical illnesses that trigger inflammation - and hence potentially contribute to depression - their previous work found a connection between depression and baseline levels of inflammation in healthy people (when someone does not have an acute infection), which can be caused by a number of factors such as genes and psychological stress.\n\n""About a third of patients who are resistant to antidepressants show evidence of inflammation,"" adds Dr Khandaker. ""So, anti-inflammatory treatments could be relevant for a large number of people who suffer from depression.\n\n""The current approach of a \'one-size-fits-all\' medicine to treat depression is problematic. All currently available antidepressants target a particular type of neurotransmitter, but a third of patients do not respond to these drugs. We are now entering the era of \'personalised medicine\' where we can tailor treatments to individual patients. This approach is starting to show success in treating cancers, and it\'s possible that in future we would use anti-inflammatory drugs in psychiatry for certain patients with depression.""\n\n###\n\nThe research was mainly funded by the Wellcome Trust, with further support from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nReference\n\nKappelmann, N et al.

Data also was collected on the effects of these drugs on depression. The review found that drugs that affect cytokines in the body appear to reduce depressive symptoms more than would be expected simply from mitigation of the underlying primary disease being treated. The study authors suggest that these new drugs could be used to treat patients with depression who are not currently helped by anti-depressive drugs.
The news release provides background information, but little data, on the suggestion that inflammation may play a role in depression, and emphasizes that anti-cytokine treatments might be useful in just a sub-set of patients. It includes a quote from an author cautioning about the “serious side effects” of these drugs, and that much more work needs to be done before the drugs can be used in clinical practice.

By introducing the immune system to a potential future enemy, antibodies against that invader are ready to attack when the time comes. In this case, the vaccine introduces a piece of the heroin molecule to the immune system. In response, this protective system manufactures antibodies to the drug, including the components that cause the high.\n\nAs a result, those molecules never reach the brain, preventing the euphoria that may have otherwise resulted. The absence of a high could help recovering heroin users resist the temptation to relapse, the researchers say.\n\nSubscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe current study of the vaccine, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, follows eight years of laboratory research and studies in rodents that indicated the compound could neutralize heroin at different doses.\n\nHere, the Scripps investigators, working with researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University, tested the vaccine on four rhesus monkeys. The animals were given three doses of the vaccine, which elicited a successful immune response that neutralized heroin given at varying doses. The high-blocking effects of the vaccine were strongest during the first month but continued for more than eight months. The researchers did not observe any harmful side effects from the intervention.\n\nRelated: Opioid epidemic and overdose deaths blamed on pharma in Ohio lawsuit\n\nTwo of the animals had been exposed to the vaccine seven months before for a similar pilot study. All four monkeys responded to the vaccine, but the two that were receiving it a second time had a stronger response, hinting that their immune systems were already primed with the “memory” of the compound.\n\nMark Thomas, who researches addiction at the University of Minnesota Health Sciences, says that a vaccine like this could help a former heroin abuser, “forge a path to abstinence.” Thomas, who was not involved with the study, explains that he was initially wary of the vaccine approach. He figured that a person who is dependent on drugs would find a replacement if heroin no longer caused a high.\n\n“It’s not going to be a panacea,” says Thomas. But in light of the growing drug abuse epidemic, for which, he says, “we have so few tools,” adding a vaccine to the available treatments could help. “It’s an avenue that shows some promise.”\n\nRelated: Yes, drug laws absolutely hurt HIV prevention and treatment, study confirms\n\nAlthough research on humans is not yet planned, study authors Kim Janda and Paul Bremer, chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, are encouraged about this next step. Other anti-heroin vaccines have proved ineffective for people, but this compound is the first to work in primates. “We believe this vaccine candidate will prove safe for human trials,” said Janda in a statement.\n\nImportantly, this vaccine is designed to work against only heroin, not other opioids. Bremer and Janda now hope to find a company interested in conducting a human study so that the vaccine can become commercially available.\n\nRelated: CDC study finds opioid dependency begins within a few days of initial use']","To its credit, the story did include some comments from an independent expert who discussed how the vaccine–if it ever comes to market–would not be a “panacea” for heroin addiction.","Credit: Paul Asman and Jill Lenoble
The story describes early development of a vaccine for blocking the high from heroin. The story, especially the headline, makes the leap that because it’s worked in a few monkeys, it will work in people (and be safe). It’s just too soon in the scientific research process for anyone to know if this “vaccine” will work in people.

Both acupuncture and Alexander Technique prove effective for long-term relief of chronic neck pain\n\nAbstract: http://www. annals. org/ article. aspx?doi= 10. 7326/ M15-0667\n\nFree summary: http://www. annals. org/ article. aspx?doi= 10. 7326/ P15-9033\n\nURL live when embargo lifts\n\nIn a randomized, controlled trial, both acupuncture and the Alexander Technique led to long-term significant reductions in neck pain and associated disability compared with usual care alone. The study is published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nChronic neck pain is a leading cause of disability. Usual care for neck pain generally consists of prescribed medications and visits to physical therapists and other health care professionals. In addition, persons with chronic neck pain often seek complimentary care to manage their condition, such as acupuncture or the Alexander Technique. Acupuncture is a procedure in which patients have thin needles inserted into specific points on the body to relieve pain and the Alexander Technique is an educational process that teaches people how to avoid unnecessary muscular and mental tension in everyday activities.\n\nResearchers sought to determine the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture or Alexander Technique lessons compared with usual care for persons with chronic, nonspecific neck pain. Patients were randomly assigned to 12 acupuncture sessions or 20 one-to-one Alexander Technique lessons plus usual care, or usual care only. Neck pain was assessed by the Northwick Park Questionnaire (NPQ) at 3, 6, and 12 months.\n\nThe researchers found that acupuncture and the Alexander Technique lessons both led to a significant reduction in neck pain at 12 months compared with usual care alone. Both interventions had a high rate of acceptability, and greater adherence was associated with better pain outcomes. Over time, both interventions resulted in a greater increase in self-efficacy than did usual care, and these improvements were associated with better NPQ outcomes.\n\n###\n\nNote: For an embargoed PDF, please contact Cara Graeff.

The news release does a good job of reporting relevant facts from the published study. It demonstrates a good grasp of the quality of evidence in the study. A major stumble is the lack of concrete numbers that could have given the interested reader the scope of the potential benefits of the two therapies discussed.

The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. [1]\n\nThe vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV [2], was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination [3]. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine.\n\nThe trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea\'s Ministry of Health and other international partners.\n\n""While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa\'s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,"" said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO\'s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study\'s lead author [4].\n\nThe vaccine\'s manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted.\n\nSince Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine.\n\nThe trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called ""ring vaccination"" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox.\n\nWhen a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain ""contacts of contacts"". A total of 117 clusters (or ""rings"") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people.\n\nInitially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine\'s efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years.\n\nIn addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so-called ""herd immunity""). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed.\n\n""Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured"" said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea [4].\n\nTo assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects.\n\nIt was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea.\n\n""This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,"" said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, Specialist Director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group [4].\n\nIn January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO\'s Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.\n\nAdditional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called ""compassionate use"" that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO\'s partners are working to compile data to support license applications.\n\nThe rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO\'s R&D; Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.\n\nAlso published in The Lancet (embargo as above), is a phase 2 trial of a different Ebola vaccine candidate, the recombinant adenovirus type-5 Ebola vaccine. The trial was led by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and was conducted in Sierra Leone in 2015. It involved 500 healthy participants, followed for 6 months - 250 were given a high dose vaccine, 125 a low-dose and 125 a placebo. The study found that the vaccine was safe and induced an immune response that peaked at 28 days, but decreased during the six months post injection. One serious adverse event was reported, in an individual with a history of asthma. Further research on this vaccine is needed in order to assess its efficacy.\n\n###\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nThe rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust, the United Kingdom Department for International Development, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway, the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, International Development Research Centre and Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development and Médecins Sans Frontières.\n\nThe trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy.\n\n[1] http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)61117-5/abstract\n\n[2] VSV-EBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans.\n\n[3] Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus.\n\n[4] Quotes direct from authors and cannot be found in the text of the Article.']",A reference to cost and the other Ebola vaccines under concurrent development by major pharmaceutical competitors would have made the release even stronger.,"This news release discusses the results of a World Health Organization-led study of an experimental Ebola vaccine manufactured by Merck, Sharpe & Dohme. The study tested the effectiveness of the vaccine (currently referred to as rVSV-ZEBOV) among individuals who had come in contact with people diagnosed with Ebola within three weeks prior to the diagnosis, including contacts of those contacts, using a “ring vaccination” approach similar to that used to fight smallpox in the mid- to late 20th century. Among the 5,837 individuals who were vaccinated immediately after assignment to the study, none developed Ebola 10 days or more after being enrolled. In comparison, there were 23 Ebola cases identified 10 days or more in the group of 4,507 assigned to either a delayed vaccination (16 cases) or no vaccination (7 cases).  
The release delivers a good description of harms, is written in a balanced and non-sensational tone, and provides an overview of next steps for the vaccine. The release would have been improved with some reference to cost and the other Ebola vaccines under development by major pharmaceutical competitors.

Thirteen of the women taking the drug for an additional five years developed breast cancer in the opposite breast during the study, compared with 31 taking the placebo; 55 and 68, respectively, developed a recurrence of cancer in the original breast.\n\nFor any individual woman, the odds of developing “contralateral” breast cancer — that is, in the opposite breast — are still lower than 200-to-1 per year.\n\nadvertisement\n\nStill, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, who serves as the chief medical officer of ASCO and who was not involved in the study, “there’s a substantial benefit” to continuing aromatase inhibitors out to 10 years to lower the chance of cancer developing in the other breast.\n\nThe study did not continue long enough to discover whether the lower risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast translated into a lower risk of death.\n\nThe study, which was also published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, was partially funded by Novartis (NVS), which sells letrozole — the aromatase inhibitor used in the trial — as the branded drug Femara. Several of the authors have received speaking fees or consulting payments from Novartis, AstraZeneca (AZN) (which makes letrozole), and Pfizer (PFE) (maker of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane).\n\nLetrozole is available as a generic for less than $100 a month.\n\nThe trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what’s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. About two-thirds of breast cancers are hormone-receptor positive, and they have a good prognosis. Aromatase inhibitors block an enzyme that the body needs to produce estrogen.\n\nThe women had taken another breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, for several years and then were started on an aromatase inhibitor, which doctors usually prescribe for five years.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nAfter following the women for a median of just over six years, found Dr. Paul Goss of Massachusetts General Hospital and his colleagues, 95 percent of those taking letrozole for the additional five years remained free of breast cancer (meaning the disease had not returned in the original breast or developed in the opposite one). Of those taking an inert pill, or placebo, 91 percent did.\n\nPut another way, the risk of cancer returning in the original or the opposite breast was 34 percent lower in women on 10 years of letrozole compared with those who stopped after five. There was no difference in survival, however: 100 women in each group died during the study.\n\n“The reason this is a milestone trial is that it’s the first to show that 10 years [on letrozole] is better than five,” said Dr. Nicholas Robert, an oncologist with Virginia Cancer Specialists and a co-author of the study. But because the absolute benefits were not huge, and because the drug did cause side effects, it makes sense to consider this for women at the highest risk of a recurrence of breast cancer, he said.\n\nAromatase inhibitors cause side effects in some women, especially night sweats, hot flashes, and sexual dysfunction. Women receiving five more years of letrozole also had greater loss of bone in their hip, worse osteoporosis, and more fractures.\n\nExperts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. There had been no research on whether that was beneficial.\n\nDr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) “substantial. If you can tolerate the side effects, I think many women will opt to take the extra years of letrozole, so this study is practice-changing.”\n\nDr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society cautioned, however, that “one has to be cautious in interpreting these results,” partly because “based on what they show, there is no overall change in survival.”""]","This story hit all the important marks for reporting on a medical story. A solid, strong effort.","This is a story about a new study on whether extending the use of letrozole (brand name Femara), a type of drug known as an aromatase inhibitor, reduces recurrence in breast cancer survivors.
Women who have undergone treatment for hormone-receptor positive breast cancer typically take aromatase inhibitors for the subsequent five years. The study showed that extending this treatment to 10 years lowers the rate of recurrence. The added benefit of continuing aromatase inhibitors for 10 years as opposed to five must, however, be weighed against the side effects. For women who are at high risk of recurrence, the results of this study are of particular interest.
The story does a commendable job of presenting a clear and balanced report of the study findings, and by stating that the results did not find a difference in overall survival.

More Americans kill themselves than die from breast cancer.\n\nAs Dr.Thomas Insel, longtime head of the National Institute of Mental Health, prepared to step down from his job in October, he cited the lack of progress in reducing the number of suicides as his biggest disappointment. While the homicide rate in the U.S. has dropped 50 percent since the early 1990s, the suicide rate is higher than it was a decade ago.\n\n""That to me is unacceptable,"" Insel says.\n\nIt hasn\'t been for lack of trying. The U.S. has a national suicide hotline, and there are suicide prevention programs in every state. There\'s screening, educational programs, and midnight walks to raise awareness. Yet over the past decade or so, the national suicide rate has increased. In 2003, the suicide rate was 10.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013, it was 12.6.\n\nAn effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide — depression — is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system\'s success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.\n\nThat approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.\n\nLynn, who\'s now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness ""is like the pain of having a cancer,"" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts — at times almost monthly.\n\n""When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,"" she says. ""I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in."" Sometimes she couldn\'t find anything to hang on to. ""Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,"" she says.\n\nThe program that saved Lynn almost didn\'t get off the ground.\n\nFifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.\n\nSome of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called ""perfect depression care"" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.\n\nThe mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.\n\nThe plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.\n\nIf the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care — cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient\'s medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.\n\nTherapists involve patients\' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don\'t leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with ""safety plans.""\n\nLynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists\' phone numbers. And there\'s a reminder that the feeling will pass — it has before.\n\nBefore the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn\'t work very well, she says.\n\nToday, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. ""There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,"" says Espiritu, ""and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan."" The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.\n\nFor Lynn, the key was persistence — her therapists\', and her own. ""I recall one time with my psychiatrist, who kept trying to encourage me and help me find ways of coping, and I can remember saying, \'I don\'t believe there\'s hope, I don\'t see it, I don\'t feel it, I need you to hold on to that for me because it\'s not there,\' "" she recalls.\n\nHer therapists never gave up. ""There is no question that the message I got from Day 1 is that they knew they could help me, and they would help me,"" Lynn says. Over the years she\'s been in group therapy, day treatment, and, when things got bad, the emergency room.\n\nThe Henry Ford approach is catching on. A stream of visitors from U.S. health insurers and from the United Kingdom have made site visits. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has run two zero suicide training academies for teams from health care systems based on the Henry Ford principles. Other health systems have adapted the plan, including Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and the behavioral health provider Centerstone in Tennessee.\n\nEspiritu started work at Henry Ford just as the program was starting, and she remembers the initial staff meetings: ""There was a lot of, \'How can you do this? How can you aim for zero? How can you expect your clinicians to be perfect and follow this protocol?\' "" Some people didn\'t think it could be done, she says, or even attempted.\n\nStill, the health system went ahead, and the rewards were nearly immediate. Henry Ford epidemiologist Brian Ahmedani studies the numbers. In 2009, for those being actively treated for a mental health problem or substance abuse, ""we had a rate of zero per hundred thousand,"" he says. It\'s crept up to 20 per 100,000 per year, but that\'s still 80 percent lower than it was when the program began. The rate is five per 100,000 in the organization\'s general population, which is well below the national average and has remained steady despite an increasing rate of suicide statewide.\n\nPreventing Suicide National Suicide Hotline: (800) 273-8255, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org Suicide Prevention Resource Center: www.sprc.org American Foundation for Suicide Prevention: www.afsp.org National Institute of Mental Health: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention\n\nThere\'s reason to think a full-bore effort to treat depression could reduce health costs, because untreated depression is associated with higher medical bills for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. But there are training costs involved, and the Henry Ford system has had to keep its staffing up to be able to provide care for people who need it.\n\nOfficials at Henry Ford say they haven\'t analyzed the costs. But Centerstone has. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who\'d already made a suicide attempt. Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.\n\nWhy push for zero, rather than just a reduction? ""Because if you say we\'re OK with five a year, one of those might be your brother or your friend,"" says Espiritu. ""We aim for zero because it reminds all of us of what we would want for ourselves."" Maybe it is not possible, she says. But it is a goal.\n\nAnd as for Lynn, she doesn\'t consider herself cured. She says with the treatment she\'s received at Henry Ford, she\'s learned to live, even thrive, with bipolar disease. And she\'s alive. That, she says, makes her a big success story.']","A solid exploration of one health system’s suicide prevention program, although it may overstate the role of that program in causing the dramatic drop in suicides reported.","The story looks at an attempt by the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Mich., to eliminate suicide in its patients by taking a proactive approach to identifying and treating depression. The program, which was launched in 2001, is associated with a significant reduction in the suicide rate among its patients, even as suicide rates have gone up nationally.
The story is a richly told exploration of the program and its impact. And the storytelling substantively addresses the majority of our criteria. The major hole in this piece is that it doesn’t explore alternate explanations for the drop in suicides in this health system that might not have had anything to do with depression care. Inclusion of an independent perspective might have helped identify some of those reasons.

These infants often don’t survive and, even if they do, many have substantial long-term health problems.\n\nThis new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides what is thought to be the best, large-scale data in the U.S. to date on this topic. The authors, from many institutions that form a large neonatal research network funded by the National Institutes of Health, studied nearly 5,000 babies born before 27 weeks at two-dozen high-quality hospitals across the country who were followed to 18-22 months of age.\n\nThose who were born at 22 weeks of gestation survived only 5% of the time. Of those who received active treatment to help them breathe or their hearts to beat, 23% lived, 15.4% survived without severe neurological impairment, such as cerebral palsy, and 9% survived without severe or moderate neurological impairment.\n\nIn comparison, the vast majority—more than 80% -- of those born at week 26 survived with or without active care and nearly 60% had no severe or moderate neurological impairment.\n\n“A large proportion of the variation [in outcome], especially at 22, 23 and 24 weeks, can be explained by differences in whether treatment was initiated,” said Matthew Rysavy, the first author on the paper and a medical student at the University of Iowa.\n\nThe findings don’t lead to a clear-cut conclusion about when and whether lifesaving care should be administered to the extremely premature, but provide more data to help inform doctors and families when they make their decision, said Mr. Rysavy.\n\nJust 22% of babies born at 22 weeks were given lifesaving treatments compared with 72% of babies born at week 23 and 97% of babies born at week 24. The type of care they received tended to depend on the hospital where they were born. However, it isn’t clear from the data why the decision was made to provide a particular type of care, and what other factors played a role in the babies’ outcomes besides whether they were given active treatments, said the authors.\n\nElizabeth Rogers, director of the Intensive Care Nursery Follow Up Program at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco , who wasn’t involved in the study, called the new study important because it highlights the large variation in outcomes for these very premature infants.\n\nThe paper “shows that the question of when a premature infant can survive is so multifactorial and complex that no simple equation is going to be able to predict the outcome for any individual baby,” said Dr. Rogers, a pediatrics professor.\n\nThe study suggests that with intervention, more babies may live. “But if meaningful, functional, fully participatory life is what they want, I think the study also shows this is not something we can promise them at these ages,” said Dr. Rogers.\n\nThe University of California San Francisco has never resuscitated a baby born at 22 weeks because its own data suggest that at such an early gestational age, the “risks of poor outcome have outweighed the possibility of a really good outcome for families,” said Dr. Rogers, who said she wouldn’t change her clinical practice based on the new study results.\n\nThursday’s findings also highlight the importance for counseling parents, including about their child’s longer-term prognosis, and the need for a standard approach of what and how to tell them, according to Dr. Rogers.\n\nPart of that conversation could be the survival rate not of all babies born at an early gestational age, but just those who received active treatment, said the University of Iowa’s Mr. Rysavy.\n\nAt the University of Iowa’s hospital, after having a conversation with parents of babies born at 22 weeks, the majority want their babies treated, said Edward Bell, another author on the paper and a pediatrics professor at the university.\n\n“These are very difficult decisions and they need to made on a case-by-case basis by the families and physicians,” said Dr. Bell.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nElizabeth Rogers’s last name was misspelled as Rodgers in an earlier version of this article (5/8/15). Also, a statistical result from the study was incorrectly described in an earlier version of this article. The survival rate for all week 22 infants reflected those who received active treatment as well as those who didn’t, not just those who didn’t receive active treatment (5/12/15).\n\nWrite to Shirley S. Wang at shirley.wang@wsj.com']",A thorough Wall Street Journal report on a new study that explores the relationship between active medical intervention and survival — a topic considered to be controversial among pediatric experts.,"
When a baby is born at the edge of viability, the question of what action to take is a difficult and controversial one. The risks of poor outcomes are high, even if the baby survives. The Wall Street Journal highlights a new study that explores the relationship between the decision to pursue active treatment and the rates of survival and impairment. What was surprising was that the variation across centers in pursuing aggressive medical care was substantial, and it is clear that hospitals have different policies in treating babies at low gestational ages.
The article does a great job providing balance to these two approaches (active intervention versus palliative care), weighing a baby’s chances of survival with the risks of suffering from severe impairment in the future. The independent doctor quoted in the story gives a unique perspective on how clinicians may interpret the study’s findings and why aggressive medical interventions at early gestational ages may not be optimal.
Overall, this is solid health news reporting — something we are always happy to see.

But it\'s not the most accurate, according to new guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology that urge doctors instead to use a special type of MRI whenever possible.\n\nThat\'s a recommendation that isn\'t winning universal acclaim from doctors, who say CTs tend to be far more readily available and take less time to administer.\n\nAccording to the guidelines published Monday in the journal Neurology, a type of brain scan known as diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is superior to computed tomography, or CT, for diagnosing strokes caused by lack of blood flow to the brain -- by far the most common cause of stroke, accounting for nearly 90 percent of them.\n\nDr. Peter Schellinger, the lead author of the new guidelines, said his research team reviewed studies dating to 1966 and confirmed that diffusion MRI is considerably better at detecting the severity of stroke damage than a CT scan. That\'s important because, ""in general, the more you know about a problem, in this case stroke, the better you can react to problems,"" said Schellinger, of the Johannes Wesling clinical center in Minden, Germany.\n\nCT scans are a specialized kind of X-ray that provides three-dimensional images. Diffusion MRI -- a different type of imaging that doesn\'t involve X-rays -- shows where brain damage has occurred by measuring how easily water flows through the brain.\n\nSchellinger said that there are circumstances in which a CT scan should remain the preferred diagnostic tool -- for instance, when waiting for an MRI would delay immediate treatment with clot-busting drugs and also for patients who can\'t be screened with MRI because they have a pacemaker or metallic implants.\n\nAt Chicago area hospitals, suspected stroke victims usually are given a CT scan first, followed by an MRI. Changing that might not be easy, doctors say.\n\n""Does every emergency room in the country have an MRI available 24 hours a day? I would venture to guess the answer is no and resoundingly no,"" said Dr. Shyam Prabhakaran, director of the stroke program at Rush University Medical Center. ""Even in institutions like ours, where we can get an MRI done quickly as the first test, can you do it quicker than a CT scan?""\n\nDr. Jordan Rosenblum, an associate professor of radiology at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, also has doubts about whether hospital practices will change quickly.\n\n""Maybe we need to adjust our protocols, but it\'s not as simple as saying we have two modalities, and we\'ve proven that MRI is better, so now we should move to MRI,"" Rosenblum said.\n\nBut once it\'s as quick to get an MRI done as a CT, Rosenblum said, ""Then, I do see it replacing CT in a growing number of cases.""']",The story dances around – but mostly misses – key issues about whether the new guidelines would result in better outcomes (unknown) or in higher or lower health care costs (unknown).  Better pictures don’t always mean better outcomes. ,"The American Academy of Neurology has set new guidelines for correctly diagnosing most strokes, recommending a type of MRI over a CT scan. The study, a literature review of MRI and CT studies going back to 1966, was published in the academy’s journal, Neurology. The story, however, does not make it clear how much better the MRI performs nor how much a switch to MRIs nationwide would cost. It does do a good job, though, of finding voices critical of the practicality of such a switch.

In fact, the last year has been so bleak on the research front that some experts are questioning whether a long-desired safe and effective diet pill can be found.\n\nAdvisory panels for the Food and Drug Administration recommended against approval of two experimental weight-loss drugs this year — Lorqess in September and Qnexa in July — citing unacceptable risks for unimpressive benefits. Another drug, Meridia, was withdrawn from the market in October after it was linked to higher risks of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nLast week, an advisory panel did finally recommend approval of a weight-loss drug: Contrave, a combination of two existing drugs, the antidepressant bupropion and the anti-addiction medication naltrexone. (FDA rulings for all three drugs are expected next year.) But it did so with a marked lack of enthusiasm, citing the medication\'s poor effectiveness and a need to closely track health risks, such as high blood pressure, once the drug is in broad use.\n\nAs drug after drug falters or falls by the wayside, doctors who treat obese patients are growing increasingly frustrated. They say that the agency\'s standards for approving anti-obesity drugs are overly stringent and fail to recognize the health risks associated with carrying extra weight — at a time when almost 34% of U.S. adults are obese and almost 6% are morbidly obese, and when study after study has shown that the most that can be hoped for from diets and exercise, on average, is a 10% loss of body weight sustained for at least one year.\n\nSo gloomy is the climate for these drugs that some experts fear drug companies will out-and-out abandon the anti-obesity market.\n\n""Every big company is going to get out of the game, and venture capitalists are not going to invest in the smaller companies to develop drugs,"" Dr. Donna Ryan, past president of the Obesity Society, said in October during that group\'s annual meeting in San Diego.

Not often do stories address this issue, and we applaud their approach. The story comes close to achieving a balance in its attempt to answer this question. For example, the statements by Thomas and Wolfe are excellent alternative opinions to the views espoused by the obesity drug expert camp. But we wish this story had gone beyond a he said/she said look at the evidence and that it had not relied so heavily on sources that have strong ties to the pharmaceutical industry, which is pushing hard for looser restrictions on anti-obesity drug approvals.

Based on the study results, the intervention is promising for people in the initial stages of adjustment to any serious chronic illness.\n\nThe paper was published recently in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.\n\nThe HIV study is part of a larger body of positive affect research being conducted by Moskowitz. She also is studying the health effects of teaching the skills to individuals with type 2 diabetes, women with metastatic breast cancer and caregivers of dementia patients.\n\nFor the HIV study, which was based in San Francisco, 80 participants (primarily men) were taught a set of eight skills over five weekly sessions to help them experience more positive emotions. Another 79 participants were in the control group.\n\nMoskowitz and colleagues designed the tools based on evidence showing these particular skills increase positive emotions. Some of the skills included:\n\n1) Recognizing a positive event each day\n\n2) Savoring that positive event and logging it in a journal or telling someone about it\n\n3) Starting a daily gratitude journal\n\n4) Listing a personal strength each day and noting how you used this strength recently\n\n5) Setting an attainable goal each day and noting your progress\n\n6) Reporting a relatively minor stressor each day, then listing ways in which the event can be positively reappraised. This can lead to increased positive affect in the face of stress\n\n7) Understanding small acts of kindness can have a big impact on positive emotion and practicing a small act of kindness each day\n\n8) Practicing mindfulness with a daily 10-minute breathing exercise, concentrating on the breath\n\nFifteen months after the interventions, 91 percent of the intervention group had a suppressed viral load compared to 76 percent of the control group. In addition to the potential benefit of a lower viral load on the infected person, there may be public health benefits.\n\n""From a public health perspective, that is potentially huge for prevention of HIV,"" Moskowitz said. ""HIV is less likely to be transmitted with a low viral load. To have a difference like that is amazing.""\n\nThe reduced viral load could be because of a stronger immune system, Moskowitz said. Observational studies in people living with HIV have shown positive emotion is related to a higher CD4 count (an indicator of less HIV-related damage to the immune system). Or, the reduced viral load may be the result of participants\' better adherence to their antiretroviral drug therapy, which generally leads to a suppressed or undetectable viral load, Moskowitz said.\n\nThe positive emotion intervention also improved mental health. At baseline, about 17 percent of the control group and intervention group reported being on antidepressants. Fifteen month later, the intervention group was still at 17 percent but the control group\'s antidepressant use rose to 35 percent.\n\n""The group that learned coping skills did not increase antidepressant use, whereas overall the control group increased its antidepressant use,"" Moskowitz said. In addition, the intervention group was significantly less likely to have repeating, intrusive thoughts about HIV.\n\n###\n\nOther Northwestern authors include Elaine O.

To its credit, the release explains that the difference could be due to stronger adherence to anti-retroviral drug therapy in the group that received training in positive thinking and that’s what led to the decreased viral load.

A recent evidence review of several alternatives to medication found that using cognitive behavioral therapy as the first treatment for depression can be equally effective as using a second generation antidepressant.\n\nThe research from the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center was published today in the British Medical Journal. The authors focused specifically on comparing second generation antidepressants, such as Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Prozac with cognitive behavioral therapy, which includes several in-person or phone sessions with a therapist to examine how actions and thoughts can impact depression. Second-generation antidepressants refers to newer antidepressants introduced primarily in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n""Major depressive disorder is a disabling and prevalent form of depression, experienced by more than 16 percent of U.S. adults during their lifetime,"" said Arlene Bierman, M.D., Director, Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement, at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which funded the study. ""Most patients will be prescribed antidepressants. However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options.""\n\nAfter conducting a full review of the scientific literature available, the researchers examined 11 randomized controlled trials with 1,511 patients that compared a second generation antidepressant with cognitive behavioral therapy. They found that symptom improvement and rate of remission were similar between the two options, whether used alone or in combination with each other.\n\n""Primary care clinicians and their patients may not automatically consider alternatives when discussing treatment,"" said Halle Amick, research associate at the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author. ""Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies.""\n\nSide effects from antidepressants can include constipation, diarrhea and dizziness. Patients also sometimes express concerns about becoming addicted to medications and therefore prefer psychotherapy. However, psychotherapy can be time-consuming and may be substantially more expensive, depending on the patient\'s insurance benefits.\n\n""Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients. Such shared and informed decision making might enhance treatment adherence which is one of the main challenges of treating major depressive disorder,"" said Gerald Gartlehner, M.D., associate director of the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center, who was the principal investigator of the evidence review, which was also published today by AHRQ.\n\nA journal article describing all the review findings will be published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in January.\n\n""Bringing psychotherapy into discussions of treatment may also enhance coordination of care between primary care and mental health care providers in addition to addressing the issue of patient-centered care,"" Amick said. ""If primary care providers discuss psychotherapy with their patients as a valid treatment option, it may empower patients to voice their preferences and truly participate in medical decision-making and encourage them to adopt and adhere to effective treatment of their depression.""\n\nRTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center is a collaboration between RTI and the five health professions schools and the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at UNC. It is funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n\nSEE ORIGINAL STUDY']","Psychotherapy is “just as effective” as antidepressants, according to this release, but how effective is that?","This news release from RTI International states that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and second generation antidepressants are equally effective as first-line treatments for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). CBT is a general term for a wide variety of psychotherapy strategies that involve talking about one’s thoughts, feelings and behaviors in order to make positive changes. Second generation antidepressants refer to drugs introduced in the 1980s and 1990s and include the brand name drugs Prozac, Lexapro and Wellbutrin. The findings reported come from a mega-analysis of 11 previous randomized controlled studies that looked at CBT and antidepressant outcomes. The claim that they are equally effective as first-line treatments for MDD conflict with current practice guidelines recommended by the American Psychiatric Association and the British Association for Psychopharmacology that state, “psychotherapy is sufficient for treating mild depression, antidepressant medications (ADMs) should be used to treat severe depression in the context of major depressive disorder.” The news release’s claims about benefits aren’t backed up by hard numbers showing what the study authors found.

They found that CsA changed how the follicles expressed a protein called SFRP1, which stunts the development and growth of hair follicles and other tissues in the body.\n\nThe scientists were then able to identify that WAY-316606, a compound used to treat osteoporosis, has a similar effect on how SFRP1 is expressed.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe compound WAY-316606 could therefore be used to treat baldness, without patients suffering the same side effects as they would on CsA. The study was published in the journal PLOS Biology.\n\nDr. Hawkshaw said in a statement: “The fact this new agent, which had never even been considered in a hair-loss context, promotes human hair growth is exciting because of its translational potential: it could one day make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss.”\n\n“Clearly though, a clinical trial is required next to tell us whether this drug or similar compounds are both effective and safe in hair-loss patients.”\n\nA British Association of Dermatologists spokesperson said in a statement the results were interesting.\n\n“For individuals with hair loss, treatments can be very hit and miss, there isn’t one which is universally effective. For that reason new treatments are exciting as they give people more treatment options that may be effective.\n\n“This research has been tested on human tissue, which is promising, but not on humans themselves, so there is still some way to go.\n\n“It is also important to realise that this is being proposed as a treatment for hair loss, not a cure as such.”\n\nThis piece has been updated with a comment from the British Assocation of Dermatologists.']",The evidence is so scant that readers aren’t likely to get much use out of this story.,"This news story hyped lab findings as evidence that a potential “cure” for baldness could be on the horizon. Researchers at the University of Manchester in the U.K. found that a substance called Cyclosporine A (CsA), which has been used to treat immune disorders and transplant rejection, affected a protein that stunts the development of hair follicles. They then identified an osteoporosis drug called WAY-316606 that has a similar effect on hair follicles in the lab, but could potentially have fewer side effects than CsA.
The story didn’t say anything about the quality of the study and misleads readers about the implications and timeline.

But the therapy worked vastly better than University of Pennsylvania researchers David L. Porter, MD, Carl H. June, MD, and colleagues had dared to hope.\n\n""Our results were absolutely dramatic. It is tremendously exciting,"" Porter tells WebMD. ""These kinds of outcomes don\'t come around very often. We are really hopeful that we can now translate this into treatment for much larger numbers of patients and apply this technique to other diseases and to many more patients.""\n\nExcitement is spreading as oncologists learn about the findings. ""I think it is a big deal,"" says Jacque Galipeau, MD, professor of hematology and medical oncology at Emory University Winship Cancer Center. Galipeau was not involved in the Porter study.\n\n""Here\'s this guy, the handwriting is on the wall, any hematologist will tell you he is a goner -- this guy was essentially cured,"" Galipeau tells WebMD. ""These genetically engineered cells did what everyone in the field has tried to do for 20 years. The man probably had kilograms of disease in his body, and the cells mopped it up completely.""\n\nThe treatment uses a form of white blood cells called T cells harvested from each patient. A manmade virus-like vector is used to transfer special molecules to the T cells. One of the molecules, CD19, makes the T cells attack B lymphocytes -- the cells that become cancerous in CLL.\n\nAll this has been done before. These genetically engineered cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. They kill cancer in the test tube. But in humans, they die away before they do much damage to tumors.\n\nWhat\'s new about the current treatment is the addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB. This signal does several things: it gives CAR T cells more potent anti-tumor activity, and it somehow allows the cells to persist and multiply in patients\' bodies. Moreover, the signal does not call down the deadly all-out immune attack -- the feared ""cytokine storm"" -- that can do more harm than good.\n\nThis may be why relatively small infusions of the CAR T cells had such a profound effect. Each of the cells killed thousands of cancer cells and destroyed more than 2 pounds of tumor in each patient.\n\n""Within three weeks, the tumors had been blown away, in a way that was much more violent than we ever expected,""June says in a news release. \'It worked much better than we thought it would.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Somebody at WebMD must take responsibility for a headline that says “cure” after one year’s experience in 3 patients.

The phase II trial, conducted by researchers at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, demonstrated a host of benefits from the regimen.\n\nThe diet reduced cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, signs of inflammation (measured by C-reactive protein levels), as well as fasting glucose and reduced levels of IGF-1, a hormone that affects metabolism. It also shrank waistlines and resulted in weight loss, both in total body fat and trunk fat, but not in muscle mass.\n\nIn effect, the diet reduced the study participants\' risks for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related diseases, according to the findings published Feb. 15 in Science Translational Medicine.\n\n""This study provides evidence that people can experience significant health benefits through a periodic, fasting-mimicking diet that is designed to act on the aging process,"" said Valter Longo, director of the USC Longevity Institute and a professor of biological sciences for USC Davis and Dornsife. ""Prior studies have indicated a range of health benefits in mice, but this is the first randomized clinical trial with enough participants to demonstrate that the diet is feasible, effective and safe for humans.\n\n""Larger FDA studies are necessary to confirm its effects on disease prevention and treatment,"" he added.\n\nOne hundred people participated in the trial from April 2013 to July 2015. The participants, ages 20 to 70 and all generally healthy, were divided into two groups for the randomized trial.\n\nParticipants in the first group, the control group, were asked to continue their normal eating habits for three months. People in the second group were placed on a three-month test of the fasting-mimicking diet.\n\nThose on the special diet were required to eat food products supplied by the nutrition company L-Nutra during the fasting periods of five days each month. The diet, which was designed to mimic the results of a water-only fast, allowed for participants to consume between 750 and 1,100 calories per day. The meals for the fast-mimicking diet contained precise proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.\n\nAfter three months, participants in the control group were moved onto the special diet.\n\nThe researchers found that participants on the fasting-mimicking diet lost an average of about 6 pounds. Their waistlines shrank by 1 to 2 inches. Their systolic blood pressure, which was in the normal range when the study began, dropped by 4.5 mmHG, while their diastolic blood pressure dropped by 3.1 mmHg. Also, their levels of IGF-1 dropped to between 21.7 ng/mL and 46.2 ng/mL, reaching a range associated with lower cancer risk.\n\n""After the first group completed their three months on the fasting diet, we moved over participants in the control group to see if they also would experience similar results,"" Longo said. ""We saw similar outcomes, which provides further evidence that a fasting-mimicking diet has effects on many metabolic and disease markers. Our mouse studies using a similar fasting-mimicking diet indicate that these beneficial effects are caused by multi-system regeneration and rejuvenation in the body at the cellular and organ levels.\n\n""Our participants retained those effects, even when they returned to their normal daily eating habits,"" he added.\n\nThe researchers also noted that participants considered ""at risk"" because they had risk factors such as high IGF-1, cholesterol, blood pressure or blood sugar levels, made significant progress toward better health.\n\nFor example, baseline fasting glucose levels for participants with high blood sugar levels (putting them at risk for diabetes) dropped into the healthy range, below 99 mg/dl -- but these levels didn\'t drop among participants who already had healthy levels at the beginning of the study. Cholesterol was reduced by 20 mg/dl in those with high cholesterol levels, and by about 5 mg/dl in all participants.\n\n""Fasting seems to be the most beneficial for patients who have the great risk factors for disease, such as those who have high blood pressure or pre-diabetes or who are obese,"" Longo said.\n\nThe researchers had invited participants in the study for one last set of tests three months later, at the end of the diet. The research team found that the beneficial effects -- from weight loss, smaller waistlines and lower glucose, blood pressure and IGF-1 levels -- were sustained.\n\nThe next step for researchers is a large, FDA phase III clinical trial to test the FMD on patients diagnosed with age-related diseases or at high risk for them. The researchers said further investigation will determine whether the benefits of the diet can continue for several months.\n\n###\n\nThe work was funded by the USC Edna M. Jones Chair in Gerontology fund, as well as through a National Institutes of Health grant to co-author Wendy Mack at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, through the Southern California Clinical and Translational Science Institute.\n\nStudy co-authors from USC Davis were Min Wei and Sebastian Brandhorst (lead co-authors) and Mahshid Shelehchi, Hamed Mirzaei, Chia Wei Cheng, Julia Budniak, Esra Guen, Stefano Di Biase, Pinchas Cohen and Todd Morgan. Others were Tanya Dorff of USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center; Kurt Hong, of the Keck School of Medicine; Andreas Michalsen of Charité University Medical Center in Germany; and Alessandro Laviano at IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology.\n\nLongo is the founder of L-Nutra, whose food products were used in the study. His interest in L-Nutra has been disclosed and managed per USC\'s conflicts of interest policies to assure objectivity and a lack of bias in the conduct and reporting of his research.\n\nUSC also has an ownership interest in L-Nutra, and the potential to receive royalty payments from L-Nutra. USC\'s financial interest in the company has been disclosed and managed under USC\'s institutional conflict of interest policies.']","The release goes beyond what the study leaders reported, even contradicting a study author quoted within the release.","This is a news release marked by extravagant claims but a surprising lack of numerical data to back up those claims. It did not score well on our 10 systematic review criteria.
It’s about a small study of 100 people that looked at what happened if they consumed a low-calorie (between 750 to 1,100 calories per day) pre-packaged diet kit for 5 days intermittently over 6 months. The news release suggests that this regimen might lower the patients’ risks of “cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related diseases.” While the release says at the top that the trial “demonstrated a host of benefits” and later “that the diet is feasible, effective and safe for humans,” it says in the next line that larger studies are needed to confirm its effects.  So which is it?  Did it demonstrate effectiveness? Or is that an effect that needs to be confirmed?  The words matter, and can be misleading.
The news release alternated between caution and lack of discretion in describing the actual known outcomes of the diet. A study author is quoted saying the study did not prove a lowering of risk, but the news release ignores that warning and claims a risk-lowering was “demonstrated” by this early study.
One positive note: The release is to be commended for being transparent about potential conflicts of interest.

It was done before the FDA denied approval of the drug, asking for further research.\n\nOnly this study is not so new -- and its findings may be less weighty than might be concluded with its publication in this respected medical journal. Qnexa -- an investigational weight-loss drug that combines the anticonvulsant topiramate with the short-term diet drug phentermine -- was denied FDA approval last October. At that time, the FDA asked Vivus, the company sponsoring Qnexa\'s application for market approval, to conduct further research on the drug\'s safety.\n\nThe diet drug Qnexa helps obese people with weight-related medical conditions to lose more weight than those who take a dummy pill and could allow some to scale back on medications for diabetes, high blood pressure or cholesterol, according to a new study published online in the Lancet .\n\nThis newly published article details one of two clinical trials that were evaluated by the FDA before the agency decided to deny approval for Qnexa in October 2010. When the FDA\'s staff scientists combined the results of this study with a second study (both funded by Vivus, of Mountain View, Calif.) -- they concluded that the weight-loss difference between those taking Qnexa and those taking a placebo was ""of nominal statistical significance.""\n\nIn both the Lancet article and the accompanying press release, the secondary effects of subjects\' weight loss with Qnexa were highly touted: ""The findings published Online First in the Lancet ... suggest that this promising new treatment has additional metabolic benefits,"" the press release describing the study says. The authors write: ""Most importantly, weight loss achieved with phentermine and topiramate was sustained during 56 weeks with improvements in blood pressure, lipids, glycaemia, and inflammatory markers.""\n\nIn its assessment of those improvements in a June 17 memorandum last year, the FDA\'s scientists were not quite as breathless: The groups treated with Qnexa, they wrote, ""had the expected improvements in blood pressure, lipids and glycemia.""\n\nThe Lancet study does have some additional data not reviewed by the FDA - -and not entirely typical for such an article: comparisons between Qnexa\'s effectiveness for weight loss and that of two other drugs vying for the potentially vast U.S. market for weight-loss drugs. These other weight-loss-drug candidates, commercially known as Lorcaserin and Contrave, haven\'t won FDA approval either, but both remain under consideration. In a box labeled ""research in context,"" the authors offer a comparison that is certainly not apples to apples but which may give Qnexa some competitive edge: In studies performed by other researchers using different populations of subjects under different circumstances, the authors of the Lancet study note, Qnexa promoted greater weight-loss than Contrave, Lorcaserin or Orlistat (a fat-blocking drug long on the market).\n\nThe study described in the Lancet was funded by Vivus. Three of its seven authors are employees of Vivus, a fourth was an employee of the contract research organization that coordinated the study for Vivus. The lead author has served as a consultant to Vivus, and the second author acknowledged receiving donations, honoraria, consulting fees or grants from Vivus (as well as several other pharmaceutical firms with interests in weight-loss drugs).\n\nIn denying Vivus approval to market Qnexa in October, the FDA asked the company to extend the trial described in the Lancet article and to submit further findings on Qnexa\'s effect on subjects\' heart function, as well as on its safety for use in women who might become pregnant.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story gets a 4-star score as its </span>","We applaud the degree and clarity of the context and explanations provided by this story – about how this is not new info, how the FDA had problems with this kind of data when it reviewed it earlier, and how there were financial ties between the study authors and the drug maker.

Generally, massage is not covered by insurance, Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nPrevious studies of the effectiveness of massage were conducted in controlled research situations. In this study, patients were referred by a physician to a massage therapist. The massage therapist designed and provided a series of 10 massages -- at no cost to the patient -- in a clinical treatment environment, mimicking the experience of people who choose to seek massage therapy in the real world.\n\nThe study also looked at different characteristics associated with patients being more likely or less likely to experience clinically meaningful change from massage. Among the study\'s findings:\n\nAdults in the baby-boom and older generations tended to be much more likely to experience clinically meaningful changes.\n\nObese patients experienced significant improvements, but those improvements were not retained over time.\n\nPatients who were taking opioids experienced improvements in their pain from disability in some cases but were two times less likely to experience clinically meaningful change compared to those who were not taking opioids.\n\nWhile the study results are promising, much more work needs to be done, Munk said: ""The fact of the matter is that chronic lower back pain is very complex and often requires a maintenance-type approach versus a short-term intervention option.""\n\nAdditional investigation is needed to replicate the results of the initial study and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of massage therapy, Munk said.\n\n""Massage is an out-of-pocket cost,"" she said. ""Generally, people wonder if it is worth it. Will it pay to provide massage to people for an extended period of time? Will it help avoid back surgeries, for example, that may or may not have great outcomes? These are the types of analyses that we hope will result from this study.""\n\nThe study, ""Real-World Massage Therapy Produces Meaningful Effectiveness Signal for Primary Care Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain: Results of a Repeated Measures Cohort Study,"" was published online March 14 in the journal Pain Medicine.\n\n###']",How many volunteers were in the study?

The researchers are to be applauded for seeking evidence for a potential low-cost, non-pharmaceutical and non-invasive public health solution for a very common problem.
Unfortunately, the release omitted some important details such as how many volunteers were involved, how long the study lasted, including any follow-up, and how improvement in back pain was measured.

Now, according to scientists at the University of Colorado, there is even evidence that the healthy fat can boost your chances of getting pregnant.\n\nThe study, presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting, was in mice, so more research needs to be completed before omega 3 foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility. But Dr. Malgorzata Skaznik-Wikiel, an obstetrician-gynecologist who led the study, is encouraged. She worked with a group of mice that are genetically bred to have healthy ratios of omega 3 fatty acids. These mice are born with the ability to bathe cells and tissues in omega 3 fats, so the team then looked at their egg development in the ovaries.\n\nWhat she found: The mice with the higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids seemed to have more precursors to egg cells than control mice with lower levels of the fat, meaning they had a larger reserve of eggs-to-be. These could then mature into a healthy egg that is fertilized and can lead to a live birth. When the ovaries were examined even further, Skaznik-Wikiel also found that the quality of the eggs were better among the animals with higher levels of omega 3s. Higher quality eggs improves the chances that the egg will be fertilized and develop into a live pup.\n\n“Based on this study, it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility,” says Skaznik-Wikiel. “Our study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility.”\n\nExactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn’t clear yet. But other studies Skaznik-Wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function.\n\nMore studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility, but for now, Skaznik-Wikiel says that there isn’t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats. (Some people who are predisposed to bleeding problems may be at higher risk of hemorrhages with high doses of omega 3s, but those cases are relatively rare.)\n\nThere may also be other benefits linked to omega 3 fatty acids for the fetus as well, in helping nerve development — that’s why many prenatal vitamins include forms of omega 3 fats. “We hope in the future to have more answers to be able to say firmly that yes, omega 3 fatty acids are the way to go [for women hoping to get pregnant,]” she says. “But even without that firm answer at this point I don’t see the harm in supplementing.”\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.']","When there are so many bigger issues worth writing about, why is a small study involving 10 mice making headlines?","Time magazine’s story states that a University of Colorado study has provided evidence that increasing the amount of healthy fat in one’s diet “can boost your chances of getting pregnant.” No, no, no. We just can’t know this yet: It’s mouse research. Involving all of 10 mice.
The story acknowledges this later, stating that “(m)ore studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility.” But not before making big claims, such as “researchers say that a common fat found in fish like salmon, and plants like flaxseed, may play a role in boosting fertility.”
Given the scant evidence this study provides to women trying to get pregnant, we question its news value in a national news magazine web site. And this isn’t our first time to critique TIME on writing about preliminary rodent research, nor many other outlets, including the PR machines who are often behind the curtain, pitching these stories to journalists.
We generally recommend putting these studies away and waiting until more conclusive human research comes along. But, if there’s no way around it, we recommend following this model for how to do it more accurately.

But he says by using an electroencephalogram and new, sophisticated computer programs to analyze the EEGs, he and his co-authors were able to correctly identify with 80% accuracy, which babies were at higher risk for autism and which were not.\n\nScientists have known for quite some time now that the earlier a child with autism gets therapy, the easier it is to improve language and behavioral skills. In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all children be screened for autism at the ages of 18 months and 24 months. Here researchers are trying to find markers for autism before a child begins showing signs of autism.\n\nIn a new study published Tuesday in the journal BMC Medicine, scientists studied 79 infants. 46 babies had a brother or sister with known autism, which means they themselves are at an increased risk for the neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about one in 110 children according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sibling of a child with a confirmed diagnosis of autism has a 1 in 5 chance of also developing the disorder. These infant siblings were compared with 33 infants with no known family history of autism.\n\nThe babies were given EEG\'s at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. Researchers strapped a net of 64 electrodes all over a baby\'s head while it was sitting in its mom\'s lap and a research assistant was blowing bubbles to hold the child\'s attention. The electrodes measured actual firings of neurons. The EEG technique is much easier to use because the baby can be awake and moving and wiggling around, says Dr. Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for the advocacy group Autism Speaks, which partially funded this research. Other brain imaging technologies like magnetic resonance imaging would require a baby to be asleep or sedated because they have to be completely still while the test is being done. ""Nobody wants to sedate a healthy infant,"" says Dawson.\n\nBosl explains that the new computer algorithms that he developed were able to analyze results of the EEG much better than in the past. He said that, judging by the differences in brain activity, he and his colleagues could detect which babies were in the high-risk group. They say they were nearly 100% accurate when the boys were 9 months old. They were most accurate with baby girls at age 6 months. Overall, the biggest differences in brain activity were seen at 9 months – which is much earlier than when a child typically shows behavioral problems associated with autism. The differences in brain activity were smaller as the babies got older.\n\nDoctors and scientists not connected to the study are intrigued by the results but caution that this is very early research and not something concerned parents can be looking for as a screening tool for their babies any time soon.\n\nSarah Paterson, Ph.D., is the director of the neuroimaging lab at the Center for Autism Research at Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia. She is also looking for early signs of autism as part of the Infant Brain Imaging Study, but her work focuses on differences in brain structure. Paterson says that if the results out of Boston can be confirmed, ""It\'s very exciting because finding an early sign for autism is really the holy grail."" But she cautions that a lot more work needs to be done. ""This study needs to be replicated by their lab and independent scientists,"" she says.\n\nDr. Max Wiznitzer says the researchers have found a ""really fascinating technique, that offers a different way to look at the brain."" Wiznitzer – a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children\'s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio – notes that what the study can\'t tell us is what the differences in brain activity between the two groups of babies actually mean. He, too, is hopeful that further research will provide more concrete information.\n\nBosl says the first children enrolled in his study are now at 2 and 3 years old, which is the age when autism usually is diagnosed. This will now allow the researchers to evaluate them for autism and then look back at the brain activity patterns of the children who do fit the clinical criteria for autism.\n\nBosl acknowledges that if this is very early research, but he believes if the results are confirmed, it may lead to a safe and inexpensive way to detect autism, which would allow intervention before any autistic behaviors appear.\n\n""It\'ll change the field, if this works,"" says Bosl. He hopes to expand the number of babies in his study to 200. ""The only thing slowing us down right now is funding.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story did a slightly better job than its <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3663"" target=""_blank"">HealthDay competition</a>, but neither story evaluated the evidence thoroughly enough, letting the researcher end the piece with: “It’ll change the field, if this works.”  Yes, but….</span>","The photo that ran with this story appeared straight out of a dystopian fantasy: a mother holding her infant, her shoulder draped in a loose, shawl-like lattice of wires connected to a swarm of electrodes attached to her baby’s head.

But ""we need more clinical experience before we can make any definitive statements as to the efficacy of the device.""\n\nCellulaze is different from earlier treatments in that it tackles the root causes of cellulite, including thinning skin and connective fibers called septae that are believed to create tension by pulling down the skin, contributing to an uneven appearance, says Gordon H. Sasaki, a clinical professor of plastic surgery at Loma Linda University Medical University Center in Loma Linda, Calif. Dr. Sasaki is a paid consultant to Cynosure.\n\nHow Cellulaze Works: • Tiny incisions are made so a cannula, or tube, can be inserted into the skin. • Local anesthetic is inserted through the cannula. • Laser light through the cannula cuts septae—which scientists say help cause cellulite dimples. The underside of the skin is heated and some small amounts of fat are melted. • Bruises and tiny scars result, but fade with time. • Compression garments recommended to prevent fluid buildup.\n\nCellulaze is done by plastic surgeons in their offices under local anesthetic. It typically costs $5,000 to $7,000 for a bilateral area, such as the thighs, and another $2,500 or more for each additional area. One or more tiny incisions are made so a narrow tube called a cannula can be inserted into the skin. Laser light, delivered through the cannula, cuts the septae and melts small amounts of fat, Dr. Sasaki says. It heats the underside of the skin, which stimulates collagen production and makes skin thicker and more elastic, he adds.\n\nCellulaze leaves tiny scars—about two millimeters long—which fade with time, surgeons say. Typically, compression garments are recommended for at least two or three weeks to prevent fluid buildup. And there will be bruises, so patients typically need to wait three to six weeks before venturing out in a bathing suit, surgeons say.\n\n. Patients typically wait three to six weeks before going out in a bathing suit. Associated Press\n\nThe procedure can cause a buildup of fluid in the area that has been treated, which can last for months and needs to be drained regularly by a doctor.\n\nIn a written statement, Cynosure says ""a few"" patients in early trials had the buildups, called seromas, adding that they need to be drained to prevent infections and other complications. The company says it has since lowered the recommended laser dosage and it isn\'t aware of any seromas since the device hit the U.S. market.\n\nAccording to a company-funded study of 10 women published last year in Aesthetic Surgery Journal, Cellulaze resulted in skin that was 25% thicker after a year. Cellulite reduction was ""good"" to ""excellent"" as graded by physicians.\n\nDr. Sasaki, in data obtained as part of a company-financed trial that has yet to be published, says 80% of 25 patients he treated are still enjoying ""substantial improvement"" two years after the surgery.\n\nLawrence Bass, director of the minimally invasive plastic-surgery program at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York, says the procedure appears to reduce the depth of cellulite dimples. A person with less-pronounced dimples is ""most likely to get a home run"" out of the procedure, says Dr. Bass, who has attended scientific presentations of the data but hasn\'t performed the procedure. But if you have really deep ones, he adds, ""it might not be enough to make the lifestyle change you want to make, such as wearing shorts in the summertime.""\n\nThe cannula Cynosure\n\nIf a deep dimple is still visible, fat can be injected with a syringe later to even it out, Dr. Sasaki says.\n\nAnother new laser treatment both for cellulite and body contouring is i-Lipo, i-Lipo, from Chromogenex Technologies Ltd., South Wales, England. The laser, which hit the U.S. market in December, is noninvasive and involves pads placed externally on the skin. I-Lipo provokes a chemical reaction that breaks down fat into its components, says company clinical manager Donna Freeman. After the treatment, a cardiovascular workout of 30 to 40 minutes is recommended to burn off the components.\n\nThe ""Ultra"" model of the device comes with a vacuum-massage device aimed at smoothing cellulite, but the effects on cellulite haven\'t yet been tested in a clinical trial, the company says. A 34-patient study, unpublished, found eight 20-minute sessions with the device reduced midsection size by 1.8 inches, measured by a tape measure, compared with only a third of an inch for a sham therapy, which looked the same to patients.\n\nDr. Bass says he is ""skeptical"" because measuring-tape data has a large margin of error. Chromogenex says the measurements used scientifically accepted standards.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com']","Disease-mongering.  Failure to evaluate the laughably limited data that were cited.  Failure to quantify benefits or harms in a meaningful way.  Enough said?  If not, read on.","For a column entitled “Aches & Claims,” this entry caused us many aches because it didn’t adequately evaluate claims, such as:

Try a Whole-Body Scan Procedure gives far more data than a body-mass index,"['The Ache: The bathroom scale shows how much you’ve gained or lost in pounds, but gives no information about whether the change is fat or muscle.\n\nThe Claim: A whole-body scan, called Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, or DXA for short, gives a detailed snapshot of your body composition, including how your body weight breaks down into fat, bone and lean tissue.\n\nThe Verdict: The whole-body scan is highly accurate compared with most other methods for determining body composition, scientists say, and it is useful for tracking progress over time.\n\nBody-mass index, calculated using height and weight, is widely used as a measure of being overweight, but it “doesn’t tell the whole story,” says Steven R. Goldstein, co-director of the Bone Densitometry and Body Composition unit at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York. In an abstract of a 50-person study presented in October at the annual meeting of the North American Menopause Society, researchers found that 18.5% of the women with normal BMI actually had significant excess fat as measured on DXA, making them “skinny fat” people, says Dr. Goldstein, who co-wrote the paper. Also, some women flagged by BMI as overweight actually had normal levels of fat, he says.\n\nFor people trying to lose fat and gain muscle through diet, exercise and resistance training, the X-ray scan “takes the guesswork” out figuring how well you’re doing, says Param Dedhia, a physician at Canyon Ranch, a spa in Tucson, Ariz., that offers the scans. Clients typically get the scans between three months and two years apart to measure progress, he says.\n\nA DXA scan (pronounced dexa) is commonly used to measure bone density, but recently has been increasingly used to measure body composition. The scan takes three to 12 minutes, depending on the type of machine and your body size.\n\nThe cost, $45 to $350 or more, generally isn’t covered by insurance. It is available at a growing number of spas, hospitals and doctor’s offices, says Tom Webb, global product marketing manager, body-composition, for General Electric Co. ’s GE Healthcare unit, which makes two popular scanners.\n\nAfter the scan, you get a report with the mass of your bones, fat and lean tissue (including organs and muscle) broken out individually. Your body-fat percentage is also listed and can be compared with reference values for Americans. The report also shows the amount of fat and lean tissue in each body part, such as the right arm or left leg—information that can be helpful for athletes to see if an injured limb is regaining muscle, says John A. Shepherd, director of the Body Composition, Exercise Physiology and Energy Metabolism laboratory at the University of California at San Francisco.\n\nBoth of GE’s machines, the Lunar iDXA and Lunar Prodigy, and Hologic’s Horizon DXA estimate how much visceral fat you have, a measure that can help predict risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, says Dr. Shepherd, whose lab has received research funding from both companies. (Dr. Shepherd also worked as principal scientist at Hologic from 1996 to 1999 but has no direct financial relationship currently, he says.)\n\nAmong methods now available for measuring body composition, DXA “would rank among the top,” says Dympna Gallagher, director of the body composition laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. It is more accurate than water weighing, long used by researchers to estimate body-fat mass, and more reliable than bioimpedance, a method found on some home scales, and pinching a fold of skin with calipers, she adds.\n\nDXA is reliable when measuring progress over time, Dr. Shepherd says. It is important to use the same model of machine when comparing scans, as results vary slightly among them.\n\nGE Healthcare’s Lunar iDXA system for whole-body scans. Photo: GE Healthcare\n\nA 2013 study published in the Journal of Clinical Densitometry by researchers at USCF and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only small differences when the same 600 people were scanned and rescanned between three and 51 days later. For fat mass, for example, the machine was precise within about a pound in either direction.\n\nScanning too often will show incremental changes and the results won’t be meaningful, says British researcher Susan Hopkins a lecturer in medical imaging at the University of Exeter Medical School.\n\nHow often to scan depends on how fast you are making progress. An obese person on a crash diet might see a large change worth measuring fairly soon, for example, while an elderly person slowly building muscle mass through resistance training might progress slowly, and therefore need less frequent scans, Dr. Hopkins says.\n\nDXA scans involve a small amount of radiation, generally between less than 1 and 10 microsieverts, Dr. Shepherd says. That is only a fraction of a chest X-ray, which ranges from 50 to 150 microsieverts, or a mammogram, at about 400, and is about the same as one day of background radiation, he says.\n\nWrite to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nAn earlier version of the chart on median body fat percentages contained incorrect figures.']",This story checked most of our boxes but still felt inadequate — a missed opportunity to critically examine the use of a health technology that doesn’t seem to offer much tangible benefit.,"A DXA body composition scan featured in the Wall Street Journal.
The format of this story — with its hepful “Ache, Claim, Verdict” structure — suggests we are going to be treated to a no-nonsense examination of the evidence supporting dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, for whole body scans to determine an individual’s body composition in terms of fat, bone and muscle. However, the story doesn’t deliver much more than a superficial look at the technology and is lacking in critical perspective. The story concludes that DXA is much more accurate than body mass index (BMI) at calculating someone’s body composition, but doesn’t give readers much information on why this may be important to their health. It focuses on the question of how often one should get scanned, and never challenges the assumption that one needs to get scanned at all. It doesn’t mention that there appears to be no data to show that those who use these scans have any better outcomes than those who do not.

The vegetarian diet consisted of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and nuts, with animal products limited to a maximum of one portion of low-fat yoghurt per day; the conventional diabetic diet followed the official recommendations of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Both diets were restricted by 500 kilocalories per day compared to an isocaloric intake for each individual.\n\nThe vegetarian diet was found to be almost twice as effective in reducing body weight, resulting in an average loss of 6.2kg compared to 3.2kg for the conventional diet.\n\nUsing magnetic resonance imaging, Dr. Kahleová and colleagues then studied adipose (fat-storage) tissue in the subjects\' thighs to see how the two different diets had affected subcutaneous, subfascial and intramuscular fat (that is, fat under the skin, on the surface of muscles and inside muscles).\n\nThey found that both diets caused a similar reduction in subcutaneous fat. However, subfascial fat was only reduced in response to the vegetarian diet, and intramuscular fat was more greatly reduced by the vegetarian diet.\n\nThis is important as increased subfascial fat in patients with type 2 diabetes has been associated with insulin resistance, so reducing it could have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism. In addition, reducing intramuscular fat could help improve muscular strength and mobility, particularly in older people with diabetes.\n\nDr. Kahleová said: ""Vegetarian diets proved to be the most effective diets for weight loss. However, we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat, thus improving metabolism. This finding is important for people who are trying to lose weight, including those suffering from metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes. But it is also relevant to anyone who takes their weight management seriously and wants to stay lean and healthy.""\n\n###']","The release also neglects to inform readers how long the study lasted, and whether the changes were durable over the long term. ","This news release prepared for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine describes a randomized controlled trial involving 74 people with type 2 diabetes that studied the effects of a vegetarian diet on weight loss. The release describes the weight loss effects of the vegetarian diet in comparison to a conventional anti-diabetic diet but it neglects to mention the exercise component of the intervention. This omission makes it seem as if the weight loss effects were solely due to dietary changes. While it’s true that diet was the only major difference between the vegetarian and conventional diet groups, other factors such as exercise may have contributed to the beneficial weight effects in both groups.
The release also neglects to inform readers how long the study lasted — a very big hole. According to the published paper, changes in fat distributions were statistically significant at 3 months but were non-significant at 6 months.

One of the precepts of holistic medicine organizations such as the Foundation is that spirituality and emotions play as big a part in a person’s health as their physical symptoms. While it’s generally accepted that meditation can reduce stress levels in some people, which may in turn lead to better general health and well-being, this news release goes too far in claiming that Kirtan Kriya can improve memory and is a “key component” in reducing Alzheimer’s disease risk. It would take a randomized controlled trial that followed people with no memory impairment or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to see if those practicing meditation developed Alzheimer’s less frequently than those who did not. Such a trial has not been done. The major risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease are age, family history and heredity. The evidence that meditation can reduce these risk factors remains inconclusive.

But I walked out being told they couldn\'t find any cancer cells in my body. When you\'ve already accepted your fate, to have it 180 degrees changed, it\'s unnerving."" - Bill Ludwig, 70, Penn’s first T-cell patient. DAVID MAIALETTI / Staff Photographer\n\nFour years ago, University of Pennsylvania researchers published early but electrifying results. An experimental T-cell therapy eradicated end-stage leukemia in two patients, and put a third in remission. Soon after that, pharmaceutical giant Novartis partnered with Penn, aiming to commercialize the breakthrough. Since then, a more modest picture of success has emerged in treating the blood cancer, a type called chronic lymphocytic leukemia that usually strikes in middle age or later. Of the first 14 CLL patients given the T-cell therapy, four had their cancers disappear - including the first two, who are now about five years cancer-free. Four others got better but then their cancer progressed. And six had no response to the T-cell therapy.\n\nIn addition to those results, published last week in Science Translational Medicine, the Penn team has orally presented data for a total of 38 CLL patients.\n\nCancer disappeared in nine (24 percent), and temporarily regressed in another nine.\n\nCLL typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia, and may be held in check for years with chemotherapy.\n\nIn comparison, Penn\'s T-cell therapy has been spectacularly effective in more than 50 children and adults with a fast-progressing type of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Long-lasting, complete remissions have occurred in more than 60 percent of patients.\n\nOther major centers that are developing T-cell therapies, including Memorial Sloan Kettering and the National Cancer Institute, also have found that the approach works far better in ALL than CLL.\n\nThe method is complex and costly, and often triggers life-threatening complications. It involves genetically engineering each patient\'s disease-fighting T cells to recognize and attack their cancer cells.\n\nWhen it works, the therapy also offers the hope of a rarity in terminal-stage cancer: a onetime curative treatment. Stem-cell transplantation, a risky, last-resort treatment that can sometimes be curative, is not a suitable option for most patients with CLL.\n\n""The field of CLL is exploding now,"" said Penn leukemia specialist David L. Porter, the director of blood and bone marrow transplantation. ""At the very limit of this [T-cell] treatment, one could consider it like a stem-cell transplant. It\'s a highly technical approach, but it clearly has a role for a select group of patients. There is something very attractive about a once-and-done therapy.""\n\nWalter J. Urba, director of research at Providence Cancer Center in Portland, Ore., wrote an editorial four years ago cautioning that only wider testing would show whether Penn\'s ""impressive"" initial results were ""an authentic advance"" for CLL.\n\nLast week, Urba said Penn\'s T-cell therapy ""remains very exciting,"" despite the costs and toxic side effects.\n\n""Everything we do in oncology is a risk-benefit balance,"" Urba said. ""I suspect that over time we\'ll have better T-cell therapies, maybe given with other immune therapies.""\n\nIndeed, Penn and other centers have begun testing next-generation T cells in more blood malignancies including lymphomas, and against the ultimate biological challenge - solid tumor cancers.\n\nFor Penn\'s very first T-cell patient, Bill Ludwig, 70, the pace of progress is thrilling, humbling, and yet, a bit of a letdown.\n\nThe retired corrections officer from Bridgeton, N.J., was losing his decadelong battle with CLL when he agreed to try the novel therapy in August 2010.\n\n""I didn\'t hesitate because I had no options left,"" he recalled last week. ""And also, these people at Penn had been so wonderful to me and my family for 10 years. I felt obligated to say yes. Did I ever think it would be successful? Not in a million years.""\n\nHe suffered catastrophic side effects as his immune system went into overdrive and his body struggled to eliminate seven pounds worth of dead cancer cells.\n\n""I was in intensive care, with all my major organs shutting down,"" he said. ""My lower extremities were twice the size they should have been. They called my wife and said, \'He\'s not going to see the sunrise.\' ""\n\nThey were wrong.\n\n""I was a skeleton when I walked out"" a month later, he said. ""But I walked out being told they couldn\'t find any cancer cells in my body. When you\'ve already accepted your fate, to have it 180 degrees changed, it\'s unnerving.""\n\nLudwig and his wife have since bought a recreational vehicle and traveled the country, seen grandchildren graduate high school, and welcomed three great-grandchildren.\n\nStill, he can\'t help feeling disappointed that the phenomenal early success of the therapy was just that.\n\n""When two out of three are successful, you think maybe it will be 9 out of 10, or 19 out of 20. I figured if they can cure me, they can cure everyone.""\n\nHe corrected himself: ""They\'ve never said \'cured.\' But \'cancer-free\' works for me.""\n\nmmccullough@phillynews.com\n\n215-854-2720\n\n@repopter']","We were pleasantly surprised by this story’s ability to inform, despite relying on a single patient’s experience to frame the narrative.","Patient Bill Ludwig is the focus of this story on a leukemia therapy.
Early results of T-cell therapy raised hopes for some leukemia patients, but immunotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia is proving helpful only for a minority of those who receive it. In this story, an early pioneer patient shares the terrifying lows and ultimate high of his journey. While the use of a single patient anecdote in a news story is often a red flag for us, this patient’s perspective is uniquely engaging and informative. Even though he has benefited from the procedure, he details the significant side effects he faced and calls attention to the fact that most others with the disease have not fared as well.

The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology\'s annual meeting, in Los Angeles.\n\n""Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla.\n\nBagla is director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study.\n\nMuch of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. In fact, small blood vessels created by degenerative arthritis feed this inflammation by increasing blood flow to the lining.\n\nTo treat this, Bagla and his colleagues decided to try blocking those tiny blood vessels using microparticles -- spheres about a tenth of a millimeter in size made from a synthetic gel-like material.\n\nThe microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said.\n\n""It\'s an outpatient procedure, and no physical therapy is required before or after this procedure,"" he said.\n\nThe small pilot study -- the first U.S. clinical trial of this procedure -- involved 20 patients with moderate to severe arthritis pain. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday\'s annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said.\n\nThose eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said. They started with an average baseline of 72, which means their pain was brought down to manageable levels, he said.\n\nPhysical function of their knee also improved, based on an index used to judge the effects of osteoarthritis, Bagla added.\n\nOverall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded.\n\nBagla said no side effects are expected because the procedure only blocks additional blood flow to the knee, rather than cutting it off altogether.\n\n""You don\'t normally have this degree of increased blood supply to this lining. We\'re not blocking normal blood vessels to the knee or leg or bone or cartilage,"" he said.\n\nFinal results from this clinical trial are expected to be released this summer. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said.\n\nThey think it will be most appropriate for people between ages 40 and 70 who aren\'t ready to go through knee replacement, or people who are on chronic pain medication for their knee arthritis, Bagla said.\n\n""Perhaps we can demonstrate and prove patients do not need to be on these medications and can alternatively go through a minimally invasive procedure like this to reduce their knee pain,"" Bagla said.\n\nDr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure ""very promising,"" given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.\n\n""This therapy is very well-targeted to that particular mechanism, and certainly it should be investigated further,"" said Vedantham, who wasn\'t involved with the study. He\'s a professor of radiology and surgery at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nResearch presented at medical meetings is typically considered preliminary until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Arthritis Foundation has more about knee pain.']","It isn’t really clear yet how the treatment works, how long it works for, how often it may need to be done, nor what its side effects are in the short-term and long-term.","This story reports on incomplete results from an ongoing trial of a procedure to treat arthritis pain by injecting microparticles into blood vessels around the knee.
The data — from just eight patients — were presented at the Society of Interventional Radiology’s annual meeting.  While story does some things well, overall this was a tiny, short-term, unfinished study that doesn’t seem ready for a wide consumer audience.

Four years after the procedure, patients over 65 who had coronary artery bypass surgeries (called CABG or ""cabbages"") were almost 20 percent less likely to die.\n\nPut another way, 21 percent of stented patients had died after four years compared with 16 percent of surgery patients.\n\nIs that a big difference? Well, the study\'s lead author tells Shots that it might be enough to ""tip the balance a little bit, but not overwhelmingly so.""\n\nThe National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which funded the study with new ""stimulus"" money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is more bullish on the implications.\n\n""We would hope a study as powerful as this one will inform decision-makers to rethink the direction they\'re going in,"" the NHLBI\'s Dr. Michael Lauer told Shots. He says it\'s been worrying that so many doctors have been opting for stenting over surgery.\n\nStudy author Dr. William Weintraub, chief of cardiology at Christiana Care Health System in Newark, Del., is presenting the data at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. The study also appears online in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIt draws on data from more than 86,000 patients across the nation who underwent CABG operations and nearly 104,000 patients who had coronary stenting. They had blockages in either two or three coronary arteries but did not require emergency procedures.\n\nAlthough the pro-surgery outcome is not a game-changer, Weintraub says it might cause some doctors and patients to consider surgery. And he says it supports those who now opt for CABGs.\n\n""It\'s a very big deal to recommend coronary surgery to patients,"" Weintraub says. ""I think doctors work very hard to weigh what\'s best for their patients. When doctors recommend surgery, these data suggest that that decision is a good one.""\n\nBut Dr. Laura Mauri says in an accompanying editorial that the new study can\'t settle any debates. Only studies that randomly assign comparable patients to surgery or stenting can do that. Mauri is an interventional cardiologist – i.e., a specialist who does coronary stenting – at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital inBoston.\n\nWeintraub notes it\'s ""very difficult and expensive"" to do randomized studies on this question – and to make the comparison groups truly comparable. And while such a study is being done, the technology (especially stenting technology) changes. That can call into question the ultimate relevance of the findings.\n\nSo the new data may be the best that doctors and patients in this situation can expect for the foreseeable future.']",The story provides some solid information about pros and cons but could have provided more on costs and harms.,"This clear and concise piece touches on many of our criteria, but only lightly. A competing Wall Street Journal piece explained more fully how this study differs from the gold standard of a clinical trial and how this study in particular could have missed important distinctions between patients. We appreciated the story’s generally cautious tone.

It may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as 6 months who have older siblings with the disorder, according to a new study by a national network of researchers.\n\nInfants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism, which is typically diagnosed when a child is 2- to 3-years-old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech or nonverbal communication.\n\nResearchers used magnetic resonance imaging — or MRI — to scan the brains of 343 infants when they were 6 months, 12 months and 24 months old. Two-thirds of the infants were high risk, having an older sibling with autism. The scans showed that 70 percent of high-risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age 2 had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at 6 and 12 months, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine.\n\nOn the right, MRI of a baby at 6 months who was diagnosed with autism at 2 years. The dark space between the brain folds and skull indicate increased amounts of cerebrospinal fluid. On the left: MRI of a baby who was not diagnosed with autism at age 2. Note the decreased amount of CSF. UNC Health Care / UNC School of Medicine\n\nThis excess fluid “could possibly be an early biological marker for autism,” said Mark Shen, the lead author of the article, published in Biological Psychiatry, and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina’s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service\n\nSuch a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present.\n\n“The earlier we can get biological markers for autism, the earlier intervention can be initiated, and the greater the chance of better outcomes, ” said David Kennedy, Ph.D., co-director of the Child and Adolescent NeuroDevelopment Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Typically, therapists work with children and parents to improve eye contact, social interactions and communication skills.\n\nRelated: See the special bond between a boy with autism and a deaf shelter dog\n\nThe study results are “very exciting,” said Dr. Adriania Di Martino, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Medical School. Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. It may also be a mechanism in the development of autism, and it opens up new possibilities for research, she said. “You can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid.”\n\nShen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid. Normally, the liquid, refreshed four times a day, washes away byproducts that build up in the brain. But if the fluid is not flowing properly, these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation, which could “hamper brain development” and lead to autism, said Shen.\n\nCompletely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino. More studies are needed, they said.\n\nRelated: De Niro says 'find the truth on vaccines'. But scientists already did\n\nParents with children with autism should not rush to their pediatrician demanding brain MRIs for younger siblings, Shen said.\n\n“We wouldn’t recommend that every high-risk infant get an MRI until we know that the accuracy can be improved closer to the 90 percent range” from the current 70 percent, Shen told TODAY.\n\nHe and his colleagues are working on improving accuracy by combining their brain fluid findings with other recent research. In addition to flushing out the brain’s garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow. In a study published last month in Nature, 80 percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism.\n\n“We’re going to combine those two markers to see if we can improve the prediction closer to the 90 percent range, where it could be really clinically useful,” said Shen.\n\nAbout 1 in 68 children develop autism in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, But as many as 20 out of 100 infants with an older sibling with autism will develop the disorder, said Di Martino.""]","Using a number of sources to provide perspective, it also discussed the need for more research to better refine the test.","This Today.com story addresses an issue of desperate concern to parents of autistic children: the possibility of spotting signs of autism earlier than age two or three, which is the development stage at which autism is typically identified.
The story did a good job explaining the study’s design and how the benefits were measured. Using a number of sources to provide perspective, it also discussed the need for more research to better refine the test.
That said, the story would have been stronger if it had discussed the “big picture” of early markers for autism, and where this latest research fits in with that. It also needed more on the harms of a screening test like this.

Estimates from the most recent Adult Dental Health Survey in the UK suggest around one in ten people suffers from dental phobia.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a short-term therapy, typically lasting 6-10 sessions. CBT has been shown to help with a range of psychological problems, most notably for depression and anxiety-related disorders. Both cognitive and behavioural interventions have been shown to be successful in reducing dental anxiety and increasing dental attendance.\n\nThe latest study, published in the British Dental Journal, looked at the characteristics of 130 patients (99 women and 31 men) attending a psychologist-led CBT service and the outcomes of their treatment. Patients attending a clinic run by the King\'s College London Dental Institute Health Psychology Service at Guy\'s and St Thomas\' NHS Foundation Trust were surveyed for their levels of dental anxiety, general anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, alcohol use and oral health-related quality of life.\n\nThree-quarters of those assessed scored 19 or higher on the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS), indicating dental phobia. The remainder all scored high on one or more items of the MDAS, suggesting a specific fear of some aspect of dentistry. Fear of dental injections and the dental drill were the most common high scoring items on the MDAS. Nearly all patients (94%) reported a knock-on effect from problems with their teeth, mouth or gums on their daily living and quality of life.\n\nA proportion of the patients surveyed were found to have other psychological conditions - 37% had high levels of general anxiety and 12% had clinically significant levels of depression. Suicidal thoughts were reported by 12% of patients and four (3%) reported a recent intent to commit suicide. Individuals were referred to support services via the care of their GP and for suicide risk, immediate action was taken based on local service guidelines.\n\nOf all patients referred, four-fifths (79%) went on to have dental treatment without the need for sedation and 6% had their dental treatment under sedation. The average number of CBT appointments required before a patient received dental treatment without sedation was five.\n\nProfessor Tim Newton from the Dental Institute at King\'s College London and lead author of the study said: ""People with dental phobia are most commonly given sedation to allow them to become relaxed enough for a short period of time to have their dental treatment performed. However this does not help them to overcome their fear in the long term. The primary goal of our CBT service is to enable patients to receive dental treatment without the need for sedation, by working with each individual patient to set goals according to their priorities. Our study shows that after on average five CBT sessions, most people can go on to be treated by the dentist without the need to be sedated.""\n\n""However, there is a need for people with dental phobia to be carefully assessed by trained CBT practitioners working with dental health professionals. Some of the patients referred to us were found to be experiencing additional psychological difficulties, and needed further referral and management. CBT provides a way of reducing the need for sedation in people with a phobia, but there will still be those who need sedation because they require urgent dental treatment or they are having particularly invasive treatments. Our service should be viewed as complementing sedation services rather than as an alternative, the two together providing a comprehensive care pathway for the ultimate benefit of patients.""\n\nA recent study published in the same journal, co-authored by Professor Tim Newton, showed that more women than men reported dental phobia in the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey. Those with dental phobia were more likely to come from a lower income background, have more caries in their teeth and suffer from poorer oral health overall.\n\n###']",Somewhat useful findings from a study that examined how patients with dental phobias responded to cognitive behavior therapy as an alternative to sedation. But what types of sedation and what kinds of procedures?,"The release focuses on a paper published in the British Dental Journal  that evaluated the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on patients with dental phobia or related fears concerning dentistry. The release reports that CBT allowed many patients with dental phobia to receive dental care without relying on sedation, and that CBT and sedation complement each other as ways of helping patients with dental phobia address their dental health needs. The release did a good job describing benefits but was very vague on what researchers meant by the term “sedation” and the types of procedures most feared by those with phobias. In addition, the release didn’t delve into any of the limitations of this study, which was essentially a case series — considered a very low level of evidence.

Coffee did not decrease the risk of a third type of oral cancer – laryngeal cancer. They looked at nine existing studies and analyzed how much coffee was consumed by more than 5,000 cancer patients and about 9,000 healthy people.\n\nWhile these results are encouraging, it doesn\'t mean we should just go out and start drinking lots of coffee, says Mia Hashibe, lead researcher and an assistant professor in the department of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah.\n\nHashibe points out that the main risk factors for oral cancers are smoking and drinking alcohol. She says the best way to prevent getting these cancers is to not smoke or drink alcohol, rather than drinking lots of coffee. ""We wouldn\'t want to be encouraging people to drink that much [coffee], without people considering the other risks factors,"" Hashibe says. ""Each person needs to think about how they metabolize caffeine or coffee.""\n\nIn the past, there’s been a perception that coffee may be bad for you, according to Dr. Donald Hensrud, chair of preventive medicine at the Mayo Clinic. But he says that newer studies suggest that drinking coffee may actually be good for you. ""Like many things, the evidence changes over time,"" says Hensrud. He adds that when it comes to the link between coffee and head and neck cancer, ""the benefits outweigh the risks and this is just one more piece of that puzzle that supports that.""\n\nIt’s not exactly known why coffee may help prevent these cancers. But coffee contains over 1,000 different chemical compounds, including cancer-fighting antioxidants, and it’s those antioxidants that may provide a “plausible explanation” for reducing the cancer risk, says Hensrud.\n\nOther recent studies suggest coffee may have beneficial effects in other diseases like dementia, diabetes, liver and Parkinson\'s disease. However, coffee alone may not be the answer according to some experts. Dr. Dong Shin, a head and neck specialist at Emory Winship Cancer Institute says this new study suggests “there is a hint of beneficial outcomes"" with coffee and oral cancer. But he is concerned that the side effects of coffee are not addressed in this study. Shin says when it comes to preventing cancer, the combination approach is best. He suggests “consuming coffee, tea, veggies, and fruits rather than doing just one thing.""\n\nHensrud adds that there are some drawbacks to drinking too much coffee, including liver damage or increased blood pressure. Other possible side effects from drinking a lot of coffee include insomnia, reflux, heartburn, palpitations, urinary systems and increased fluid intake, says Hensrud. He says coffee can also be addictive and some people may suffer from withdrawal headaches. Too much coffee may make it harder to conceive and can increase the risk of miscarriage.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.\n\nEditor\'s Note: Medical news is a popular but sensitive subject rooted in science.

A new study confirms that it is also effective in the management of postmenopause symptoms such as hot flashes, sleeplessness, vaginal dryness, and anxiety, without serious side effects. The study outcomes are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nThe use of complementary and alternative medicine for the management of menopause symptoms has surged in recent years as women have attempted to identify alternatives to hormone therapy (HT). Although HT is the most effective treatment for managing most menopause symptoms, some women have turned to herbal medicine because they are either not candidates for HT or are concerned about the negative publicity surrounding potential side effects. Fennel, an herb containing essential oils, has phytoestrogenic properties. Phytoestrogens are estrogen-like chemicals in plants that have been used to effectively treat a wide array of menopause symptoms.\n\nIn this small trial of 79 Iranian women aged 45 to 60 years, soft capsules containing 100 mg of fennel were administered twice daily for eight weeks. Improvements were compared between the intervention and placebo groups at four, eight, and 10 weeks, with a significant statistical difference documented. In the end, fennel was concluded to be a safe and effective treatment to reduce menopause symptoms without serious side effects. The study described in the article ""Effect of Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (fennel) on menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women: a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial"" is one of the first clinical studies to examine the benefits of fennel for managing menopause symptoms, even though it had been previously studied and confirmed to manage premenopause symptoms.\n\nThe study was completed in Tehran, Iran, where the average age of women at menopause is younger than in the United States: 48.2 years versus 51 years, respectively. Some of the most common adverse effects of menopause are hot flashes, vaginal dryness, sleep problems, joint and muscular discomfort, exhaustion, irritability, anxiety, and depression.\n\n""This small pilot study found that, on the basis of a menopause-rating scale, twice-daily consumption of fennel as a phytoestrogen improved menopause symptoms compared with an unusual minimal effect of placebo,"" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, executive director of NAMS. ""A larger, longer, randomized study is still needed to help determine its long-term benefits and side effect profile.""\n\n###']","Although the release includes a cautionary quote at the end calling for further study, the headline is far too optimistic for a small study of brief duration.","This news release from the North American Menopause Society makes a brief study of fennel in reducing menopause symptoms sound like the final word on the subject — but we’ve seen many other situations where a larger study debunks a short-term small scale study. 
The release describes results of a small, 10-week pilot study of 79 Iranian women designed to credibly assess the value of the licorice-like herb in reducing hot flashes, insomnia and other symptoms of menopause.
Although the release includes a cautionary quote at the end calling for further study to support the investigators’ claim of benefit, the headline is far too optimistic for a small pilot study. The release lacks numbers to put the claims in context; cost information and potential harms are also left out.
As a result, it will be tough for the intended audience of journalists, or other readers, to determine whether fennel is a truly effective and safe short- or long-term treatment choice.

But here\'s the challenge: How can people be motivated to eat healthier and move more? Increasingly, the answer might include digital medicine.\n\n""Just telling people to do things doesn\'t work,"" says Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health. If it were easy, there wouldn\'t be more than 80 million adults in the U.S. with prediabetes.\n\nOmada has rolled out a digital program, delivered on smartphones and other devices, that incorporates all the ingredients known to help people overhaul their habits. It includes e-coaching; peer support; education; diet and exercise tracking; and electronic nudging. (Forget to weigh in or track your meals? You\'ll get texts or emails reminding you to do it.)\n\n""Week by week we have lessons on different themes, "" Duffy explains. ""They\'re interactive, and there\'s little games"" to keep it dynamic. Participants are matched with a group of peers (online) and they\'re led by a coach, who they can text or email back and forth with. ""We call it the symphony effect,"" Duffy says, because there are multiple methods working together to help participants stay on track.\n\nGetting started\n\nSometimes fear is a good motivator for losing weight. Don Speranza is in his late 60s and lives on a farm along the Columbia River in Washington state, where he runs a bed and breakfast with his wife. He\'s also the chef at the inn. ""I\'m immersed in food all day,"" Speranza says.\n\nLast year he received an email from his doctor at Kaiser Permanente with some test results. ""It was like a gut punch, "" Speranza says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Don Speranza Courtesy of Don Speranza\n\nBased on his weight, which had been crept up to 210 pounds, and the results of his bloodwork to test his glucose, he was diagnosed with prediabetes. This means his blood sugar level was elevated, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with the condition.\n\n""It was a real come-to-Jesus moment,"" Speranza recalls. He knew that diabetes increased the risk of heart disease and can lead to many other complications including vision loss and amputations.\n\nWhen he signed up for the Omada program, the first thing he received was a scale. He began to weigh himself daily. He also began to track what he was eating. Each day he\'d log his weight and meals and upload the data to a dashboard. His coach could see the data, too, and give him advice and encouragement.\n\n""Oh, my coach, "" Speranza says. ""I can\'t sing her praises enough, she was so responsive."" Even though they never met in person, they bonded. He took her advice and suggestions.\n\nHe realized, for instance, that he ate too much of the wrong things. ""Homemade breads and croissants, pasta and pizza,"" Speranza ticks off the list of baked treats with a mix of reverence and resolve in his voice.\n\nSperanza realized he had to change his relationship with these foods. Temporarily, he cut out all these refined carbohydrates. He had to train himself to resist all the treats he bakes for his guests.\n\nInstead, he began to fill his plate with more protein, vegetables and healthy fats. He raises animals on his organic farm, so he eats pastured meats, and a lot of salmon.\n\n""Week by week, I\'d make one or two little changes at a time, "" Speranza says. ""It was a game changer.""\n\nThe weight began to fall off, and he started to move more. His coach nudged him to switch up his morning routine. He says he was accustomed to sitting each morning for an hour or so just drinking coffee. ""Now, I\'ll start the coffee,"" he says, but before he drinks it, ""I\'ll go outside and walk."" He tracks his movement withe a wearable electronic device. He began with 2,000 steps logged during his morning walk but has now increased his steps significantly. And he rides a stationary bike, too.\n\n""Now, I can almost keep up with my wife,"" Speranza says with a laugh.\n\nSince last May, he has lost about 50 pounds (52, to be exact, but it fluctuates a bit) and his blood sugar has returned to the normal range. He no longer has prediabetes.\n\n""I feel so much better,"" Speranza says. As a baker, he buys flour in 50 pound sacks. ""Now, when I look at [the sacks] I\'m aghast to think that\'s what I was carrying around.""\n\nSuccess is not automatic\n\nNot every Omada Health participant makes the progress they\'re aiming for. After all, pulling off these changes is difficult\n\n""I\'m still on the journey to get to more optimal, health"" says Lonny Northrup, who lives in Utah. He lost weight while participating in the program, but when he hit a plateau in his weight loss, he felt stuck and he says he didn\'t get the personal support he would have liked from the program. ""For [many] days in a row I got an email saying, \'Hey, we noticed you didn\'t step on the scale,\' "" he says. ""For some reason that didn\'t get escalated to the coach."" So he says that was a disappointment.\n\nOverall, he says he would recommend the Omada Health program to a friend. ""I got really good, specific recommendations that worked for me and my lifestyle,"" Northrup says. And he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key, too.\n\nThere is some evidence that these kinds of programs are working. A recent pilot study with Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare that included about 200 people, all of whom were at high risk of Type 2 diabetes, found that 75 percent of the participants completed the Omada program and lost at least 5 percent of their body weight. And about 1 in 4 participants lost 7 percent of their body weight or more. That\'s promising, because there\'s evidence that a 7 percent body weight loss cuts the risk of developing diabetes by about 60 percent.\n\n""This is one of the most exciting things,"" says Mark Greenwood, a physician with Intermountain.\n\nOmada Health is not the only player in this space. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes many diabetes prevention lifestyle change programs, delivered both in-person and online, including Vida, which bills itself as a ""health transformation team"" that is data and tech-driven.\n\nAdditionally, traditional players in the weight loss space, such as Weight Watchers, now offer some similar incentives, such as personal coaching.\n\nGreenwood says he\'d like to see many more patients try diabetes prevention programs. And he says he\'s pleased with the results of the pilot study of Omada\'s program.\n\n""The data really does confirm that when you give people tools and help, instead of just preaching to them, it really does help.""']","We always want health stories to mention costs, and for this story on a new, relatively untested weight loss plan, cost seems especially important.","This NPR story profiled a health app that’s comprehensive — providing both diet and exercise tracking, education about healthy habits, personal coaching, electronic nudging, and peer support.
The story featured a patient success story (and one less successful one–which was good to see) and briefly described positive data from a pilot study, leading to a rather upbeat take. However, the article did not provide much context for the technology-based treatment program: How do similar programs compare? What are the costs? What are the long-term outcomes? We think such context, and perhaps a dose of skepticism, is absolutely necessary — especially in the weight loss arena where so many seemingly promising ideas wither over time.

Gains after two years were about the same for Eylea and Lucentis (ranibizumab), contrary to year-one results from the study, which showed Eylea with a clear advantage. The three drugs yielded similar gains in vision for patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment. The clinical trial was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), which is funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“This rigorous trial confirms that Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all effective treatments for diabetic macular edema,” said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D. “Eye care providers and patients can have confidence in all three drugs.”\n\nEylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all widely used to treat DME, a consequence of diabetes that can cause blurring of central vision due to the leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in the retina. The macula is the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The drugs are injected into the eye and work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance that can promote abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage. Although the drugs have a similar mode of action, they differ significantly in cost. Based on Medicare allowable charges, the per-injection costs of each drug at the doses used in this study were about $1850 for Eylea, about $60 for Avastin, and about $1200 for Lucentis.\n\nDRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. When the study began, participants on average were 61 years old with 17 years of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Only people with a visual acuity of 20/32 or worse were eligible to participate (to see clearly, a person with 20/32 vision would have to be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal vision could see clearly at 32 feet). At enrollment, about half the participants had 20/32 to 20/40 vision. The other half had 20/50 or worse vision. In many states, a corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in at least one eye is required for a driver’s license that allows both day- and nighttime driving.\n\nEach participant was assigned randomly to receive Eylea (2.0 milligrams/0.05 milliliter), Avastin (1.25 mg/0.05 mL), or Lucentis (0.3 mg/0.05 mL). Participants were evaluated monthly during the first year and every 4-16 weeks during the second year. Most participants received monthly injections during the first six months. Thereafter, participants received additional injections of assigned study drug until DME resolved or stabilized with no further vision improvement. Subsequently, injections were resumed if DME worsened. Additionally, laser treatment was given if DME persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections. Laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for DME until widespread adoption of anti-VEGF drugs a few years ago.\n\nAmong participants with 20/40 or better vision at the trial’s start, all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart. On average, participants’ vision improved from 20/40 vision to 20/25.\n\nAmong participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial’s start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines, compared with visual acuity before treatment. Eylea outperformed Avastin at the one- and two-year time points. While Eylea outperformed Lucentis at the one-year time point, by the two-year time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different. At the end of the trial, average visual acuity was 20/32 to 20/40 among participants in all three groups.\n\n“The results of the DRCR Network’s comparison of Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy,” said John A. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. “The study suggests there is little advantage of choosing Eylea or Lucentis over Avastin when a patient’s loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild, meaning a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, patients with 20/50 or worse vision loss may benefit from Eylea, which over the course of the two-year study outperformed Lucentis and Avastin.”\n\nThe number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups. Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year.\n\nThe need for laser treatment varied among the three treatment groups. By two years, 41 percent of participants in the Eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema, compared with 64 percent of participants in the Avastin group and 52 percent in the Lucentis group.\n\nThe risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by end of the trial was higher among participants in the Lucentis group. Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of participants in the Avastin group. This difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies, and therefore may be due to chance. Continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies. Cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke are common complications of diabetes. The occurrence of eye complications, such as eye infections and inflammation, was similar for all three drugs.\n\nResults of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Eylea and Lucentis were provided by drug manufacturers Regeneron and Genentech, respectively. Additional research funding for this study was provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, also a part of NIH.\n\n“This important study would not have happened without funding from the National Institutes of Health and the cooperation of two competing companies,” said Adam R. Glassman, M.S., principal investigator of the DRCR.Net Coordinating Center at the Jaeb Center for Health Research.\n\nThe DRCR.net is dedicated to facilitating multicenter clinical research of diabetic eye disease. The Network formed in 2002 and comprises more than 350 physicians practicing at more than 140 clinical sites across the country.

The trial found that all three commonly prescribed drugs were effective in treating DME but that among patients with 20/50 vision or worse, Eylea led to better outcomes than Avastin. In patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment, all three drugs were equally effective. Fewer of the patients receiving Eylea needed corrective laser treatment to meet a visual acuity of 20/40, which is necessary to pass a driving exam (41% versus 64% for those getting Avastin and 52% who received Lucentis).
The release is an exemplary presentation of an important study. It provides detailed cost information, presents benefits in terms that are meaningful to readers, and pays considerable attention to the potential harms of these treatments. The only area that we found Not Satisfactory was the discussion of novelty: we felt that the release could have done even more to explain just how uncommon this type of study is and why it’s newsworthy.

Pour a cup of tea,"[""Next time your fussy, colicky baby has you teetering on the brink of sleep-deprived lunacy, consider a cup of herbal tea.\n\nAnd that's for the baby, not for you.\n\nTea --made with chamomile, licorice, fennel and balm mint-- was one of the most effective treatments for relieving symptoms of colic, according to a new Pediatrics study, which reviewed 15 randomized clinical trials of alternative treatments for infantile colic.\n\nThe study analyzed trials that included various types of treatment and found the most encouraging results came from treatments using herbal remedies and sugar solutions, while the least effective results came from treatments involving manipulation and probiotic supplements.\n\nOf the three herbal studies, one with the most significant results was when babies were given fennel extract. (No surprise since fennel seeds are known to be a natural digestive aid because they relax the smooth muscle lining of the digestive tract and also help to expel gas.) Another study looked at Colimil, an herbal formula containing fennel, lemon balm, and German chamomile, which after use showed a significant difference in crying times per day.\n\nFive studies that looked at glucose and sucrose supplements found significant easing effects on colic symptoms, too.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the study is how the authors explain what many a frazzled parent already knows – that it's hard to know how to treat colic because colic itself is such a wily beast.\n\nThe difficulty in finding an effective treatment is related to our lack of understand of IC (infantile colic). Its pathophysiology is unclear; food allergies, formula intolerance, immaturity of gastrointestinal tract, excessive gas formation or intestinal cramping have all been suggested as possible etiologies. Arguably, any rational treatment should be directed at the mechanisms of the disease itself.\n\nThe study didn't include specific instructions on dosage, so check with your pediatrician before trying any herbal remedy.

1749,story_reviews_01440,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3110/,2010-08-26 20:39:44,"Gaining on death, cooling therapy catches on slowly","[""PHILADELPHIA (Reuters Health) - It was a cold, drizzly March morning this year when Ed Sproull’s heart stopped beating.\n\nNurse researcher Marian Leary (top) applies a cooling wrap on research assistant David Fried during a body cooling for trauma patients demonstration at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, June 3, 2010. REUTERS/Tim Shaffer\n\nAt 58, he had arrived at work feeling fit and healthy. As he stepped into the elevator at De Lage Landen Financial Services in Wayne, Pennsylvania, he had no reason to suspect he would end up in a limbo between life and death.\n\nHe collapsed without a sound. He didn’t grab his chest, he didn’t indicate any pain or discomfort, he just closed his eyes and slumped down, coffee in hand. Unbeknownst to the colleague with him in the elevator, Sproull’s heart had entered a state of electric anarchy, no longer pumping out blood.\n\nResponding to the 911 call from De Lage Landen, EMS Captain Chris Griesser of Berwyn Fire Company arrived less than 15 minutes later. He had to cut through a crowd to get to Sproull.\n\n“We shocked him with the AED and we think we have a pulse,” one woman kneeling next to the body told Griesser. Sproull’s shirt had been ripped open, and electrodes from a so-called automated external defibrillator (AED) were glued to his chest. Within a few minutes of the cardiac arrest, a company employee trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) had jolted Sproull’s heart back to its normal rhythm.\n\nStill, it was far from clear that Sproull would survive. He was in a deep coma and barely breathing. If he made it to the hospital alive, chances were his brain would be so profoundly damaged that he would never be able to live a normal life again.\n\nIn fact, the vast majority of the 300,000 Americans who suffer cardiac arrest every year die. Despite massive investments in research and technology, fewer than eight in 100 leave the hospital alive, a rate that has remained stagnant for almost 30 years. Even if the heart is restarted, only a minority make it. And of those who do, many end up in nursing homes with crippling brain injury.\n\nDoctors say those statistics could change, however, if more people had access to a procedure called therapeutic hypothermia - cooling the body. As medical procedures go, it’s among the simplest: Chill the patient about six degrees Fahrenheit — using cold intravenous saline, cooling blankets or ice packs — and wait 24 hours; then re-warm the patient slowly and cross your fingers.\n\nIt’s also the only treatment proven to protect the brain after cardiac arrest. In 2009, an analysis of earlier studies showed it increased the chances that people like Sproull would survive with intact brain function by more than half. Since 2005, it’s been a staple part of resuscitation guidelines, inspiring a newfound can-do attitude in a growing number of emergency physicians across the country.\n\n“We are pushing into the gray zone and grabbing people back,” said Dr. Benjamin Abella, a doctor at the Center for Resuscitation Science at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\n\nYet many hospitals have been slow to pick up the procedure. Those that use it often do so inconsistently, incompletely or with big delays, experts say. What’s more, most emergency medical services still rush cardiac arrest patients off to the nearest hospital, making it a high-stakes geographical gamble whether or not that person gets cooled.\n\n“There are probably thousands of people in this country who end up having severe brain damage because they don’t have access to this treatment,” Abella said. “It’s not subtle.”\n\nTHE BRAIN ON FIRE\n\nWhen a cardiac arrest stops the circulation, the first organ to crave oxygen is the brain. But the real trouble doesn’t begin until the heart is shocked back to life and starts flooding the brain with fresh oxygen. In a chemical wildfire of sorts, the cells crank up their activity so much it becomes toxic. Waves of electricity crisscross through the tissue, inflammation revs up, and untold numbers of brain cells switch on genetic suicide programs.\n\n“The one thing that has a beneficial effect on every single one of these processes is cooling the tissue,” said Dr. Stephan A. Mayer, an expert in cooling and a neurologist at Columbia University in New York. “Imagine a massive chemical burn injury. Cooling the tissue, hypothermia, is like throwing cold water on the whole response.”\n\nSo when Sproull was wheeled into the emergency room at Paoli Hospital, a dozen minutes from De Lage Landen, cardiologist Dr. Todd Rudo went to work quickly. He wrapped Sproull in ice bags and later blankets with cold fluid circulating through them. As is commonly done, he also gave him sedatives and muscle relaxants to make sure he wouldn’t shiver and reheat.\n\nMeanwhile, Sproull’s wife of 23 years, Debbie, was stuck in slow-moving traffic. A veteran nurse practitioner, she had been at work at Bellevue Hospital in New York when she received the bad news. She scrambled to her car, clutching a printout with directions to Paoli.\n\n“I was three hours away, in the middle of a nor’easter, trying to drive there,” she said. “Basically everybody was involved but me.”\n\nKnowing nothing of Paoli Hospital, she decided to have Ed transferred to the nationally renowned resuscitation center at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nNO EASY FIX\n\nA dark-haired, energetic man of 39 whose frequent smile makes his eyes squint, Abella has been one of the driving forces behind Penn’s cooling program, which launched in 2006. He had started another cooling program at the University of Chicago back in 2002, when the procedure was still very much experimental. That same year, two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine got the ball rolling, becoming central parts of the evidence that led the American Heart Association to recommend cooling a few years later.\n\nBoth studies were relatively small — including 77 and 275 patients, respectively — but had a strong design. For each, researchers randomly assigned resuscitated, comatose patients to cooling or normal temperature. In one study, half the cooled patients survived with good brain function, compared to only a quarter of those who weren’t cooled; in the other, funded by government grants, the numbers were 55 percent and 39 percent, respectively.\n\nThe most up-to-date analysis of randomized controlled trials — the most powerful study design — was published in 2009 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. Based on 481 patients, it showed cooling increased the number of people with good brain function by more than half, and overall survival to hospital discharge by slightly more than one-third.\n\nPenn now cools some 40 patients a year. After introducing the procedure, the number of people who can leave the hospital without brain damage leapt from 20 percent to 45 percent — a small number in absolute terms, but 10 human lives nonetheless.\n\nLarger studies suggest one extra patient will survive without brain damage for every four to six people cooled. That could mean an additional 2,300 Americans would be able to leave the hospital with little or no brain damage every year, according to a government-funded study from 2008. Some experts say the number could be much higher.\n\nNo matter what the exact number, “That’s a lot of people going home to their families who otherwise would have died or had severe brain injury,” Abella said.\n\nBehind him, the office wall is crowded with awards, including one from a Philadelphia magazine listing him among the city’s best physicians under 40. A few years ago, he created the first national training course in cooling, which has been fully booked ever since.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean all or most hospitals have embraced the procedure, he says. There aren’t any good data, but Abella estimates about a quarter of U.S. hospitals reliably offer cooling. Others may use it erratically, depending on which doctor is attending the emergency room.\n\nAccording to a survey from 2005, the same year the American Heart Association began recommending cooling, three-quarters of U.S. physicians caring for cardiac arrest patients had never used the procedure. Beyond saving lives, there is no carrot for those who do, just as there is no stick for those who don’t.\n\n“The problem with cooling, and the reason why hospitals have been slow to adopt it, is it hits medicine in its Achilles heel — meaning it’s not a new medicine or device where you just buy it and it’s done,” Abella said. “It’s a system, it’s a protocol. It involves interaction of doctors and nurse teams from different units.”\n\nAbella’s assessment rings true with many other experts who spoke with Reuters Health. Basically, they say, every hospital needs someone who’s enthusiastic enough about cooling to take on the task of organizing the logistics and establishing a protocol. Earlier this year, a study of 14 Canadian hospitals found that apart from lack of knowledge, hospital staff pointed to collaboration between personnel and simple practical matters as big hurdles.\n\nAs one staffer responded in the study, published in the journal Critical Care Medicine: “Where is the ice machine? Are there enough bags? How is it actually going to work? Where do the bags go?…”\n\nCOOLING ON THE CHEAP\n\nMany of the physicians involved with cooling research -- including Abella and Columbia's Mayer -- also receive funding and consultant fees from companies manufacturing hypothermia equipment. Such companies include Philips Healthcare, Zoll, Medivance and Gaymar. (See sidebar here )\n\nTheir cooling machines, which look somewhat like R2-D2 from the Star Wars movies, usually cost between $20,000 and $30,000 each. They work pretty much like air conditioners, circulating cold water through blankets wrapped around the patient while monitoring the patient’s temperature with a thermometer.\n\nThe machines have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for temperature control, but not specifically in cardiac arrest. Abella, Mayer and many other physicians use them, but readily agree sophisticated equipment isn’t necessary, as long as you can get the patient cold fast and keep his or her temperature within tight bounds.\n\nAt Elmhurst Hospital, a red brick behemoth planted squarely in the middle of Queens, New York, Dr. Scott Weingart is doing exactly that. Using cold IV saline, which costs only cents, he is able to chill people in about 30 minutes. Then he wraps the naked patient in cooling blankets, which cost less than $100, hooked up to a Blanketrol cooling machine from Cincinnati Sub-Zero. The machine is about $12,000 new, but Weingart shares them with the operating room.\n\n“Money is not an issue,” said Weingart, who has no financial ties to the industry. “Any hospital that’s using money as a reason not to start (cooling) is kind of missing the boat.”\n\nElmhurst cooled more than 50 patients in 2009, placing it ahead of all other New York City hospitals. In Weingart’s experience, and according to published reports, complications from surface cooling are very rare.\n\nWhile Elmhurst doesn’t have a dedicated hypothermia team, Weingart said it took about a year to get everybody up to speed. The biggest expense was nursing time, he explained. And it matters little that cooling is not currently reimbursed by Medicare, because the nursing care should have gone in anyway. Hospitals that cite staffing needs as an excuse for not using cooling “probably weren’t taking ideal care of that cardiac arrest patient before hypothermia,” he said.\n\nWORST FEARS REALIZED\n\nEd Sproull landed on the roof of Penn Hospital’s Ravdin Building on the morning of March 31. Since 2009, Penn has flown in patients from surrounding community hospitals to get them cooled as fast as possible, and a helicopter had picked Ed up at Paoli as soon as the weather cleared up.\n\nAt Penn, doctors told Debbie Ed’s chances were excellent. He’d had a heart attack — a common trigger for cardiac arrests — but it was probably minor. She began to hope the worst was over.\n\nAs it turned out, Debbie recalled, “They were completely incorrect.”\n\nWhen Abella started the re-warming process, Ed, still unconscious, suddenly got very sick. His blood pressure plummeted, suggesting his heart was about to give in again. He was rushed to the catheterization lab, where cardiologists x-rayed his heart in a procedure known as coronary angiography.\n\n“Our worst fears were realized,” Abella recalled. Ed’s coronary arteries, which were supposed to supply his heart with blood, were clogged by thick layers of hardened cholesterol.\n\nTo survive, Ed would need open-heart surgery. It was a lot to go through under any circumstances, and nobody knew what Ed’s neurologic status was. Would he emerge from his coma after the surgery? Would he have crippling brain damage? Bluntly put, was it worth the trouble and the cost?\n\nCOOLING MEANS DOCTORS TRY HARDER - AT A COST\n\nDebbie and the doctors decided it was, and Ed ended up having triple bypass surgery. At another hospital, he might never have gotten that far.\n\n“Many, many, many times we know that practitioners will withdraw care early,” said Dr. Bentley J. Bobrow, an emergency physician and the medical director of the Arizona Department of Health Services. “And they do that based on the premise that the person won’t wake up. Well, all those historic observations of people not waking up are all prior to the era of therapeutic hypothermia.”\n\nIn 2007, Bobrow started a network of cardiac arrest centers in Arizona that now covers more than three-quarters of the state. While cooling is only one of the requirements for being part of the network, it has been a fundamental game changer, Bobrow told Reuters Health.\n\n“Therapeutic hypothermia has really changed the paradigm on withdrawal of care for cardiac arrest,” he said. “One of the major interventions, I think, is that we simply are trying harder and we’re not giving up as easily or as early.”\n\nIt is that attitude that’s driving the real cost of cooling. In fact, 99 percent of the total cost for cardiac arrest patients who are cooled is incurred by care delivered after re-warming the patient, such as inserting a defibrillator or rehabilitation, according to a 2009 study by Dr. Raina Merchant and colleagues at Penn.\n\nFor 100 patients, she found, cooling would add about $3.1 million, including training hospital staff and buying cooling, to a bill already amounting to more than $10 million for standard care.\n\nWhat would that cost the U.S. health care system every year? Not all patients are good cooling candidates. Some may have a blood pressure that’s too low, and so die quickly, and others have do-not-resuscitate orders. Abella estimates about 25,000 Americans might benefit from cooling. If Merchant’s assumptions scale up, treating those would mean spending an additional $780 million. In return, some 4,000 more people would be able to walk back to their old lives and jobs every year, at a price of slightly less than $200,000 each.\n\nCOMING BACK\n\nIt took one more day before Ed began to stir, on the morning of April 2. Debbie had stayed with him every day, except for the few hours she slept at a nearby hotel.\n\nAt first Ed was combative and confused, and he tried to yank out the breathing tube going down his throat. “He started to look at me, and he would nod, and he would try to talk to me through the tube,” Debbie recalled, “but he was totally glassed.”\n\nThe week Ed spent in the intensive care unit (ICU) was the saddest time for Debbie. He would move his lips around the breathing tube as if asking her what he was doing there, but she couldn’t bring herself to tell him the truth.\n\nWhen she finally caved in, it broke her heart. “I’ll never forget the look on his face. I mean, he started to cry, and I’ve never seen him cry — I’ve known him for 25 years.”\n\nOnce Ed was out of the ICU, he was able to sleep through the night without being interrupted every few hours by nurses and doctors checking his vital signs and adjusting his medications.\n\nOne morning Debbie walked in and saw Ed sitting up in bed.\n\n“He’s there texting away, back on the Blackberry,” she recalled. “I knew, I knew that he was back. I knew that we were going to step right back into our life.”\n\nPICKING UP SPEED\n\nDespite a broad consensus that cooling works, a lot of unanswered questions remain. Most studies, for instance, have focused on patients with ventricular fibrillation, in which the heart quivers instead of pumping out blood. It’s unknown if cooling will be equally effective if the heart is completely still when it’s jumpstarted by a defibrillator, just as it’s uncertain how much speed matters when cooling a patient.\n\nSome of the answers may become apparent over the next few years, as more and more healthcare systems begin to implement cooling. New York City, for instance, launched a citywide program in January 2009 in which all resuscitated cardiac arrest patients, with a few exceptions, are taken to a hospital that uses cooling. And this August, the city equipped its ambulances to start cooling with cold IV saline even before they reach the hospital.\n\nSo far, 46 of the New York’s 53 hospitals have joined the program, said Dr. John Freese, an EMS medical director at the New York City Fire Department. It’s still too soon to give definite numbers, he added, but “I can say without question that survival to hospital discharge has improved.”\n\nFreese said not every hospital across the country would need to use cooling. “We need to recognize that some hospitals are going to be more capable of providing top-level care for the patients,” he told Reuters Health. “We need to have some regionalization of critical care. That’s where the solution lies.”\n\nHealthcare systems nationwide already use a regionalized model to handle serious trauma, such as gunshot wounds. Earlier this year, the American Heart Association proposed a similar system for cardiac arrests.\n\nDr. Graham Nichol of the University of Washington in Seattle, who co-wrote AHA’s policy statement, said regionalization was already happening in some states. Apart from Arizona, he said Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington State were also starting to regionalize cardiac arrest care.\n\nOne of the sponsors behind these efforts is the Medtronic Foundation, the philanthropic part of Medtronic, which produces defibrillators and other medical devices. This year, the foundation launched a program to fund a multipronged approach to cardiac arrest care. It focuses on both community responses, such as having defibrillators readily available in public locations, and on emergency rescue and hospital care, including cooling.\n\n“What we are launching at this point is this whole idea of simultaneous delivery of a systems-based approach in a given state,” Joan Mellor of the Medtronic Foundation told Reuters Health. “We have a goal with our partners to increase survival by 50 percent in a given state over five years.”\n\nShe said the foundation was working with hospitals in a handful of states, including Minnesota and Washington, and was giving grants of up to about $3 million. The hope, she added, was that these local efforts would inspire other healthcare systems across the country.\n\nA NEW OLD LIFE\n\nOn a sunny evening in June, Ed, a white shirt hiding his scarred chest, recalled what it was like to come back from “the gray zone.”\n\n“When I first woke up, I didn’t remember what my own house looked like,” he said. “I sort of had to look up numbers that I used to call six times a day.”\n\nBut each visitor who came to the hospital brought old memories, and soon his old life started flooding back. “It was a little bit overwhelming.”\n\nIn early May, less than a month after he had left the hospital, he picked up his oldest son at the airport and drove him back to their house. Three days later, he went back to working as a vice president at De Lage Landen. And on June 6, he and Debbie went to celebrate their youngest son’s high school graduation.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n“It was just really the two of us and my son who really could value it,” Debbie said.\n\nEd, who is soft-spoken and jovial, said he had settled right back into his old life, except he now takes a bunch of medications and keeps clear of white bread and coffee, which his doctors tell him are less healthy for his heart than whole grain and decaf.\n\n“I used to be a coffee junkie,” he said wistfully. But soon he is chuckling, spinning a yarn about a 5-foot blue shark he and some friends once caught off the shore of Barbuda.""]","Reuters Health digs deep and wide on this one, affords the story a lot of space, and delivers readers a very good story.

This in-depth (3400 word) report on cooling patients after cardiac arrest in order to reduce the risk of brain damage offers readers a wealth of detail on therapeutic hypothermia, the available evidence of its effects, and some of the apparent reasons most hospitals have yet to put it into routine use. The story specifically notes the small numbers of patients that have been studied in controlled trials, as well as the fact that many patients would need to be treated in order for one additional person to recover fully. The story also makes a potent case that institutional and individual inertia and resistance to change has slowed the adoption of this technique despite recommendations from leading professional groups.
However, the only patient featured in the story is a man who fully recovered. The powerfully emotional telling of his cardiac arrest, his treatment, the strain on his family and their joy at his recovery may overwhelm the hard data indicating that while cooling does appear to offer benefits (and no greater risk of harm), the overwhelming majority of such patients will not recover despite receiving therapeutic hypothermia.
We couldn’t ask for a more comprehensive statement of the available facts, and yet it seems likely that most readers will come away from the story believing that cooling has more powerful effects than even its strongest advocates would claim.

Winer, chief of women’s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.\n\nTamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.\n\nAbout 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.\n\nIn the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.\n\nAbout 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.\n\nThere was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n“The treatment effect is real, but it’s modest,” said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n“Over all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,” Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n“They don’t feel well on them, but it’s their safety net,” said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. “I have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.”\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. “If it can keep the cancer away, I’m all for it,” said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.\n\nCost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.\n\nPerhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would “apply to endocrine therapy in general,” meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years. Other doctors were not so sure.\n\nThe Atlas study was paid for by various organizations including the United States Army, the British government and AstraZeneca, which makes the brand-name version of tamoxifen.""]","An excellent story, addressing most major points of extended tamoxifen breast cancer treatment research while incorporating clear, clean writing.  Better than the competing ","Also longer than the competing AP and USA Today stories, coming in at more than 1,000 words – an increasingly rarer but appreciated treat in journalism these days.
The story makes a good point missing from the USA Today article – that many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis may pass through menopause by the time they finish tamoxifen or experience early menopause as a result of chemotherapy.  This is an important point in trying to weigh how beneficial the extra treatment really is for premenopausal women.

""We still have to find better ways to educate the millions of women suffering with VVA about the symptoms, however, so that more of them know it is common, decide to discuss treatment with their healthcare professional, and seek symptom relief with appropriate treatment.""\n\nThe new results were part of a multi-center randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial for TX004HR, an investigational bio-identical 17β-estradiol applicator free vaginal softgel capsule. Previous publications have shown TX004HR to be safe and effective at alleviating symptoms of VVA. The survey, which included 731 respondents with a 96 percent response rate, sought to quantify participants\' satisfaction with the application method and overall treatment delivery system. The majority of women taking either TX004HR or placebo (85.4 - 92.1 percent) found the product easy to use.\n\nVVA is a chronic condition associated with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). VVA affects 50 to 70 percent of post-menopausal women, and is characterized by pain with sexual activity, dryness, and discomfort. Current on-the-market treatments for VVA include both over-the-counter creams and moisturizers as well as several safe and effective prescription treatments in cream, tablet, ring or oral form.\n\nPrevious survey research completed by Dr. Kingsberg and others has shown that while 32 million women may be experiencing symptomatic VVA and suffering from related impacts on sexual function, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem and overall quality of life, only 7 percent are currently using a prescription therapy to alleviate symptoms. Though they may suffer from physical and emotional pain as a result of VVA, women may not feel comfortable discussing these symptoms with a healthcare professional, may not recognize the symptoms as treatable, may not fully understand the treatment options available, or if they did receive treatment, found the current prescription treatment options inconvenient, messy, or uncomfortable to use.\n\n###\n\nFinancial disclosure: Dr. Kingsberg has served as a consultant for TherapeuticsMD, the manufacturer of TX004HR, as well as Acerus Pharmaceuticals, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Bayer Healthcare, Emotional Brain, Materna, Novo Nordisk, Nuelle, Palatin Technologies, Pfizer, Sermonix Pharmaceuticals, Shionogi Inc. and Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAbout University Hospitals\n\nFounded in 1866, University Hospitals serves the needs of over 1 million patients per year through an integrated network of 18 hospitals, more than 40 outpatient health centers and 200 physician offices in 15 counties throughout northern Ohio.

The news release reports the results of a study examining women’s satisfaction with an applicator-free softgel used for vaginal estrogen therapy to treat post-menopausal vaginal dryness that can cause pain during sexual intercourse. The study involved 731 post-menopausal women who used a placebo softgel or one of three containing varying levels of an investigational low-dose estrogen therapy. 
The release provides good context on what post-menopausal vaginal dryness is and how often it shows up in women. But the release was weak on describing attributes that readers need to know when assessing this potential new therapy — such as cost, harms, benefits, evidence, and what makes it different from existing estrogen-based  treatments.
While the study itself pointed out the softgels’ ability to dissolve quickly as a benefit, the release omitted this but added “elegant” as an abstract, less informative, benefit. Readers would have been better served with a more concrete approach to addressing usefulness.

If men had menstrual cramps, I think we\'d have more treatment options than Midol by now. OK, enough complaining. A British company is attempting to develop a medication designed to target the specific cause of menstrual cramps. The researchers presented data from a Phase 2 clinical trial Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco.\n\nMenstrual cramps are caused by contractions of the uterus and an increase in the hormone vasopressin. The goal of the experimental medication, called VA111913, is to block this hormone. The other remedies women use for relief -- painkillers and birth control pills -- only address the symptoms of menstrual cramps, not the cause.\n\n""This is a different approach,"" said Andy Crockett, vice president of business development for Vantia Ltd., the company developing the drug. ""Right now, the current therapies for menstrual cramps are poorly tailored.""\n\nWhile half of all women experience some menstrual cramps, about 10% to 20% have a severe condition, called dysmenorrhea. ""It\'s one of the leading causes of work and school absenteeism in the United States,"" Crockett said. ""We certainly believe this drug has the potential to be a breakthrough.""\n\nIt\'s still too soon to know if the drug will work, however. It has passed initial safety tests and is now being tested on 100 women in the United Kingdom and three U.S. sites (Peoria, Ariz.; Austin, Texas; and Salt Lake City). The findings from the Phase 2 trial are expected later this year, but it will be several more years until the medication, if proven safe and effective, makes it to the marketplace.\n\nUntil then, ladies, you\'ll just have to suffer.\n\n-- Shari Roan\n\nPhoto credit: Roxana Villa / For The Times']","This story reports that data were presented at a scientific meeting.  But it didn’t tell readers what the data showed.

This story reports on a very experimental new drug (so experimental it doesn’t have a name yet) that is designed to block the hormone vasopressin, a hormone that causes contractions of the uterine muscles (which causes cramps and bleeding).

Rather than prepping patients with iodine-alcohol — a common antiseptic combination in C-sections — the research indicates that chlorhexidine-alcohol is significantly more effective. The researchers argue that the evidence is strong enough to change standard skin-prep practices for C-sections.\n\nThe study appears online Feb. 4 in The New England Journal of Medicine and coincides with a presentation at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s Annual Meeting in Atlanta.\n\n“One of the biggest complications of surgery, and of C-sections in particular, is infection,” said first author Methodius G. Tuuli, MD, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology. “For a new mother who needs to care for her baby — which is stressful even when all things are equal — having an infection can really impair her ability to do that. We are very interested in clarifying the best ways to prevent these infections, reducing the burden on the patients, on their infants and on the health-care system as a whole.”\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million women in the U.S. delivered their babies by C-section in 2013, with surgical-site infections complicating 5 to 12 percent of those deliveries. The average cost of treating those cesarean-related infections in the hospital is $3,500 and may be much higher for severe infections.\n\nThe research shows that patients in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group developed significantly fewer infections than patients in the iodine-alcohol group. Those who received the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination had a 4 percent infection rate, which is nearly half that of the patients who received the iodine-alcohol combination — 7.3 percent.\n\nThe clinical trial included 1,147 patients who underwent cesarean sections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Of 572 patients randomly assigned to receive the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination, 23 developed an infection at the site of the surgery within 30 days of the procedure. Of 575 patients who randomly received the iodine-alcohol combination, 42 developed a surgical-site infection.\n\nThe investigators pointed out that all other standard procedures for reducing the risk of infection after surgery, including giving preventive antibiotics beforehand, were the same in both groups.\n\nStudies of other types of surgeries also have suggested the superiority of chlorhexidine over iodine in preventing infection. But according to Tuuli, the unique circumstances of a C-section — that bacteria come from both skin and vagina and that a woman’s immune system is altered during pregnancy — mean the results of these studies may not apply.\n\nIn addition, past trials comparing antiseptics before surgery included relatively few participants and often compared a chlorhexidine-alcohol combination with iodine alone. These studies could not determine whether the worse performance of iodine alone was due to the chlorhexidine, the alcohol or the combination.\n\nAlthough the new study was conducted at only one hospital, the researchers said the patient population was racially diverse and that more than 60 percent received public insurance. Tuuli and his colleagues also pointed out that the superiority of the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination was consistent whether the C-section was scheduled or unscheduled, whether or not the patient was obese, whether staples or sutures were used to close the wound and whether the patient had chronic medical conditions, including diabetes.\n\nHighlighting the significance of the findings, the study’s senior author, George A. Macones, MD, the Mitchell and Elaine Yanow Professor and head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said, “This study is a tremendous addition to the literature on preventing surgical-site infections after cesarean. There are few circumstances when a single study should change our practice. But based on the biological plausibility and the striking reduction in surgical-site infections with chlorhexidine, this is one of those circumstances.”\n\n###\n\nThis work was supported by a Women’s Reproductive Health Research Career Development grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant number 1K12HD063086-01; and by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.\n\nTuuli MG, Liu J, Stout MJ, Martin S, Cahill AG, Odibo AO, Colditz GA, Macones GA.

Through its affiliations with Barnes-Jewish and St. Louis Children’s hospitals, the School of Medicine is linked to BJC HealthCare.']",This news release comparing antiseptics to prevent post-cesarean section infection covers nearly all the bases. Well done.,"Women who deliver babies via cesarean section (C-section) surgery may develop infections of the incision, and this news release describes research that shows an alternative combination of skin-cleaning agents prior to surgery may prevent those infections more effectively. The randomized study, which took place at a single hospital, included more than 1,000 patients. It showed that patients prepped for surgery with chlorhexidine-alcohol had a 4% infection rate compared with 7.3% for patients prepped with iodine-alcohol.
This well-written news release meets almost all of our criteria for accuracy and includes helpful context about the price of infection care. One area of concern is the recommendation to change the standard of care based on just one study in a single hospital. While it’s a strong study, perhaps it should be replicated in an unrelated setting and be blinded as well as randomized before recommending a change in practice.
Like another release we recently reviewed on chocolate for preventing preeclampsia, this one focused on a study presented at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s annual meeting. This quality of this well-crafted release is a nice contrast to the previous one that was graded 0 stars.

The study appears in Scientific Reports.\n\nGestational diabetes occurs only in pregnancy and results when the level of blood sugar, or glucose, rises too high. Gestational diabetes increases the mother’s chances for high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy and the need for cesarean delivery, and the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes later in life. For infants, gestational diabetes increases the risk for large birth size. Unless they have a known risk factor, such as obesity, women typically are screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test approximates the average blood glucose levels over the previous 2 or 3 months, based on the amount of glucose that has accumulated on the surface of red blood cells. According to the authors, comparatively few studies have examined whether the HbA1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes, and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers analyzed records from the NICHD Fetal Growth Study, a large observational study that recruited more than 2,000 low-risk pregnant women from 12 U.S. clinical sites between 2009 and 2013. The researchers compared HbA1c test results from 107 women who later developed gestational diabetes to test results from 214 women who did not develop the condition. Most of the women had tests at four intervals during pregnancy: early (weeks 8-13), middle (weeks 16-22 and 24-29) and late (weeks 34-37).\n\nWomen who went on to develop gestational diabetes had higher HbA1c levels (an average of 5.3 percent), compared to those without gestational diabetes (an average HbA1c level of 5.1 percent). Each .1 percent increase in HbA1c above 5.1 percent in early pregnancy was associated with a 22-percent higher risk for gestational diabetes.\n\nIn middle pregnancy, HbA1c levels declined for both groups. However, HbA1c levels increased in the final third of pregnancy, which is consistent with the decrease in sensitivity to insulin that often occurs during this time period.\n\n“Our results suggest that the HbA1C test potentially could help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes early in pregnancy, when lifestyle changes may be more effective in reducing their risk,” said the study’s senior author, Cuilin Zhang, Ph.D., of the Epidemiology Branch at NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nExercise and a healthy diet may lower blood glucose levels during pregnancy. If these measures are not successful, physicians may prescribe insulin to bring blood glucose under control.\n\nThe authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.\n\nAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD): NICHD conducts and supports research in the United States and throughout the world on fetal, infant and child development; maternal, child and family health; reproductive biology and population issues; and medical rehabilitation.

For more information about NIH and its programs, visit www.nih.gov.\n\nNIH…Turning Discovery Into Health®""]",Some discussion on the cost considerations of widespread screening for gestational diabetes would have made the release stronger.,"This release accurately describes an observational study using second-hand data from another study  which found that a relatively inexpensive blood test (HbA1c or A1C for short), commonly used to monitor diabetes, might help identify women at risk for getting gestational diabetes as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. The release does a good job of explaining that the disorder carries risks — including the development of adult type 2 diabetes long after birth — for both pregnant women and their newborns.
The release notes that the study does not scientifically demonstrate that measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy can in fact determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. On the down side, the release doesn’t mention what it would cost in dollars or potential over treatment to screen every women in the early weeks of pregnancy;  offers no information about the overall prevalence and incidence of gestational diabetes or any details about the women whose records were studied; and waits until the last sentence to note that there also is no firm evidence that lowering HbA1c levels with diet and exercise before or in early pregnancy will actually reduce risk for gestational diabetes.

We think this test could change that,"" she said.\n\nIn a new study published in the journal Academic Emergency Medicine, Papa and her team recently performed CT scans on 152 children and compared the results of those scans with results from the blood test she developed. As expected, the high definition imagery from the CT scans was able to identify which patients had suffered visible traumatic brain injuries. Moreover, the study showed that the blood test detected symptoms of concussions, even when brain injuries were not visible on the CT scan.\n\nThe team then tested blood serum from the same patients, which was taken less than 6 hours after their injuries. ""With our blood test, we were able to identify the presence of brain injuries 94 percent of the time,"" said Papa. ""This simple blood test was nearly as accurate as a state-of-the-art CT scan.""\n\nEven more impressive, the blood test also gave doctors an indication of how severe the brain injury was. ""We were looking at different types of brain lesions detected by the CT scans, ranging from mild to serious injuries, and found that the biomarker we tested for actually corresponded to the injuries. Levels of the biomarker were lower in mild cases, and were much more elevated in severe case,"" said Papa.\n\nThe biomarker this particular blood test looks for is known as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain.\n\nWhen there\'s an injury to the brain cells, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, which makes them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\nCurrently, almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or balance problems, or symptoms that are reported by the child, like headaches, blurred vision or feeling groggy. Neither scenario gives doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury.\n\nCT scans can provide a more definitive profile of the injury, ""however, they are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure,"" said Papa. ""You really want to minimize the amount of CTs you do to your patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it.""\n\n""If there was a simple diagnostic tool like a blood test that can tell us quickly and accurately if a brain injury has occurred, and how severe it might be, that would be ideal,"" said Papa. ""That\'s what we are striving for with this project.""\n\nIn fact, Papa envisions the development of mobile devices that could diagnose concussions on the spot, much like the devices diabetics use to test their blood with a simple finger prick and a drop of blood.\n\n""The idea is to get a point-of-care test that could be used on the field, to help the coaches, the trainers and the athletic directors, make a decision then and there about whether the child should go back to play,"" said Papa.\n\nIt\'s estimated nearly a quarter of a million children a year are treated in hospitals for traumatic brain injuries like concussions, that occur while playing sports. That\'s an average of nearly 700 children a every day.\n\n""If we could find a simple test that takes the guess work out of diagnosing these kids, that would completely change the way we approach concussions and would certainly give parents greater peace of mind,"" said Papa.\n\nResearchers plan to do more studies with the blood test, but they hope it will be commercially available within the next 5 years.\n\n###']",Whenever you hear about a ‘simple blood test’ run for the hills cuz there ain’t no such thing.,"This news release describes a recently published journal article on a study that evaluated a blood test that was designed to detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children. The study reports that head injury causes the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from the brain into the bloodstream, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood correspond to the severity of the head injury. According to the release, the blood test correctly identified the presence of concussion or traumatic brain injury in 94 percent of the cases. But the release fails to mention that many positive results from the test would be false-positives, which would result in additional testing and may pose additional health risks. The release notes that concussion and traumatic brain injury are usually diagnosed based on symptoms — such as perceived balance problems or reports of headaches or grogginess — and that the blood test provides an objective test that can be used for diagnosis. However, the release fails to speak to a more important aspect of the marker, that is it’s potential negative predictive value. As noted in the study the biomarker has a 98% negative predictive value. That means that a negative result, if the biomarker holds up to additional testing, would rule out concussion.

It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and results were to be presented Wednesday at a meeting of American Heart Association in Chicago.\n\nThe so-called DEFINE trial involved 1,623 patients with coronary heart disease or at high risk for it. All were taking statins to lower LDL cholesterol. Roughly half also received ancetrapib, while half got a placebo. On average, within 24 weeks patients getting ancetrapib saw LDL levels drop by nearly 40 percent compared with the placebo group, while their HDL levels rose by 138 percent. There were no significant side effects.\n\nIf the same benefit were seen in all patients at risk of heart disease – far from a sure thing – it would translate to hundreds of thousands of fewer deaths and heart attacks over a five-year period, according to Dr. Christopher Cannon, the lead study author and a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\n“It’s an amazing result,” said Dr. Robert Eckel of the University of Colorado, a past president of the American Heart Association. “It’s like a rocket that landed on Jupiter, rather than the moon.” Still, Eckel warned it’s too soon to say whether ancetrapib would actually prevent disease over the long run.\n\nThere’s ample reason for caution. A similar medication, torcetrapib, was considered promising four years ago, but was shelved by Pfizer after studies found it actually raised blood pressure and the risk of heart problems and death.\n\nDr. PK Shah, cardiologist at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, said that he’s encouraged by DEFINE but that some of the details give him pause. “It appears to be safe and to not raise blood pressure,” Shah told CNN, “but it’s not a slam-dunk.” For one thing, despite improved cholesterol levels, patients did not see less inflammation in their blood vessels. Inflammation is a sign of damage from cholesterol.\n\nTo try to provide final answers, Merck is launching a study – called REVEAL – to follow 30,000 people, in several countries, over four years. The first patients will be enrolled in April, according to Dr. Rory Collins of Oxford University, where the research will be overseen.\n\nLee Davies, a Merck spokesman, said the company is not likely to seek FDA approval until those results are in, most likely in 2015. By then, results will also be in on a large study of a similar drug, dalcetrapib, made by Merck’s competitor, Roche.']","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">The most glaring flaw in the story is that it sings in harmony with drug company marketing campaigns that equate elevated cholesterol with heart attacks and death. There is a relationship, but it’s far more complex and subtle than most people realize. Journalists have a responsibility to seize opportunities to counter popular myths. This story misses a chance to question the cholesterol dogma.</span>","



If things go well with future experiments and clinical use, we may someday look back on this trial as a turning point for this new class of drugs that affect how our bodies manage cholesterol, but this story takes the corner too fast. The results of the trial of anacetrapib give researchers confidence that they can safely proceed to the next round of testing without exposing patients to the life-threatening side effects caused by a similar drug, torcetrapib. However, this story (which misspells the drug’s name throughout the online version) emphasizes potential, but uNPRoven, health effects. There is good material in the story, including several cautionary statements (deep in the story) about how anacetrapib has yet to demonstrate it can save lives or reduce disease. It also reports that the trial was sponsored by the company developing the drug, though it fails to point out the financial ties of the researcher that is quoted.

""Human donor corneas work very well,"" Griffith said. ""However, there is a shortage of good quality corneas that can be used for transplantation.""\n\nThe shortage means trouble for many of those whose corneas -- the clear surface at the front of the eye -- have been injured or damaged by illness. An estimated 5 million people in the world have an eye disease called trachoma that affects the cornea, and another 1.5 million to 2 million are thought to have developed cornea-related blindness through other diseases or trauma.\n\nFor more than a century, doctors have considered transplantation of corneal tissue from deceased donors to be the best treatment, the study authors wrote. Artificial corneas are another option, but they\'re difficult to implant into the eye and can cause side effects, the researchers said.\n\nIn the new study, researchers tested corneal implants that are ""biosynthetic,"" meaning they\'re created with the help of living tissues. In this case, the corneas are produced with the help of human collagen -- a kind of protein -- that\'s grown in yeast. The mock corneas were then placed into the eyes of 10 patients after the diseased corneas were removed.\n\n""We were pleasantly surprised that in six patients, vision improved from about 20/400 to 20/100, meaning that these patients could see objects four times farther away than before the operation,"" said Griffith, director of the Integrative Regenerative Medicine Center at Linkoping University in Sweden.\n\nThe researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients. With the lenses in place, they all had improved vision, Griffith said.\n\nWhy didn\'t they all get better vision immediately without the contact lenses? ""We believe that sutures used in this study resulted in roughness on the surface,"" Griffith said. ""The contact lenses compensated for the surface roughness, resulting in improved vision. We will use less disruptive sutures in our next clinical study, and this should correct this problem.""\n\nAs for side effects, Griffith said the patients didn\'t report any pain or discomfort, and there were no signs that their bodies tried to reject the corneas, a risk that people face when they get transplanted organs.\n\nAs for cost, Griffith said the biosynthetic corneas ""in theory"" should be cheaper than donated corneas. Griffith said a German study recently found that donated corneas cost about $2,500.\n\nThe next step in research, Griffith said, is to create a ""new generation"" of cornea implants and test them on a wider variety of patients.\n\nThe study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of Science Translational Medicine.\n\nDr. Mark J. Mannis, chair of the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science at the University of California, Davis Eye Center, said the findings in the study appear to be valid. ""This is true cutting-edge work and brings an exciting new option to the repertoire of corneal transplant surgeons,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about corneal transplants, try the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']",There were some strengths in this story that did not appear in the other two we reviewed (,"This story establishes the small scope of the story up high. It brings in one outside voice and is more cautious than the other two stories in describing the number of people affected by corneal conditions. It also is the only story to use a dollar figure when discussing the costs and to put an actual number to the degree of improvement in people’s vision. The story would have received a higher score had it explained a little bit more about the study’s limitations and explained how this procedure likely will not be available for many years, if ever.

Now there are some promising results from a study in 161 people with a specific genetic mutation that affects about four percent of cystic fibrosis patients.\n\nLung function got 10 percentage points better, on average, in people who got the drug compared with those taking a placebo. The improvement at six months was still present almost a year after the study\'s start.\n\nThat much improvement is ""a big deal for CF patients,"" Robert Beall, president of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation told Shots. ""It is larger than any other clinical intervention we\'ve ever had in cystic fibrosis.""

The findings appear in an upcoming issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (CJASN).\n\nPatients with chronic kidney disease are advised to follow dietary recommendations that restrict individual nutrients such as phosphorus, potassium, protein, and sodium; however, empirical evidence suggests that these restrictions—which can be difficult to abide by—have limited effects on reducing patients’ risk of premature death.\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that overall eating patterns may have greater effects on patients’ health and longevity. To investigate, a tem led by Giovanni Strippoli, MD, PhD (University of Bari, in Italy and Diaverum, in Sweden), and Jaimon Kelly (Bond University, in Australia) analyzed the medical literature, finding 7 relevant studies that included a total of 15,285 participants.\n\nHealthy dietary patterns were generally higher in fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, whole grains, and fiber, and they were lower in red meat, salt, and refined sugars. In 6 studies, healthy dietary patterns were consistently associated with a 20% to 30% lower rate of mortality, with 46 fewer deaths per 1000 people over 5 years. There was no significant association between healthy dietary patterns and risk of kidney failure.\n\n“Chronic kidney disease now affects about 10% to 13% of the adult population and substantially increases risks of cardiovascular complications and early death,” said Prof. Strippoli. “In the absence of randomized trials and large individual cohort studies, this study is the best available evidence to drive clinical decision-making by patients and doctors on whole dietary approaches in chronic kidney disease.”\n\nStudy co-authors include Suetonia Palmer, PhD, Shu Ning Wai, MSc, Marinella Ruospo, MSc, Juan-Jesus Carrero, PhD,and Katrina Campbell, PhD.\n\nDisclosures: The authors reported no financial disclosures.\n\nThe article, entitled “Healthy Dietary Patterns, Mortality and End-Stage Kidney Disease in CKD: A Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies,” will appear online at http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/ on December 8, 2016, doi: 10.2215/CJN. 06190616.\n\nThe content of this article does not reflect the views or opinions of The American Society of Nephrology (ASN).

Now, new research reported in the journal Pediatrics finds, the combination of camphor, menthol and eucalyptus oils actually does ease cold symptoms and help children suffering from upper-respiratory infections sleep.\n\nIn the study, funded by an unrestricted research grant from Procter & Gamble, makers of Vicks, researchers took 138 children between the ages of 2 and 11, with symptoms like cough, congestion, runny nose and restless sleep that lasted seven days or more. Only children with moderate cough and severe stuffy nose were eligible, and those were divided into three groups.\n\nSome were treated with Vicks, some with a placebo consisting of petroleum jelly and others got no treatment at all. Parents were surveyed the day before treatment about the severity of their child\'s symptoms. That night, 30 minutes before bedtime, Vicks or petroleum jelly was rubbed onto the child\'s chest and neck. The next day parents were questioned about their child\'s symptoms overnight.\n\nChildren in all three groups got better, but those treated with the VapoRub saw the greatest improvement, and parents in this group also had improved sleep, the study found.\n\n""The American Academy of Pediatrics says the currently available oral cough and cold medications are not effective for children and have the potential for side effects, "" said Dr. Ian Paul, principal investigator and associate professor of pediatrics and public health sciences, Penn State College of Medicine.

Vicks VapoRub is not recommend for children under the age of 2.']","This story packed in a lot of great information, but it also fell a little short when characterizing the strength of the results. Reporters should always take a hard look at the statistics being used to tout a study’s findings, especially when the research was company-sponsored.","



This story of a clinical trial of a generations-old cough and congestion remedy hits almost all the key points that we would expect of a report on even the most aggressive intervention for a life-threatening condition. Where it falls short is in describing the differences in symptom improvement reported by the groups given VapoRub, petroleum jelly or no treatment. Parents were asked to check boxes on a seven-point scale that went from 1=“not at all” through 4=”moderate” to 7=”very much or very severe.” By using a seven-point scale, instead of a three-point or five-point scale, the trial increased the chances of finding a statistically significant difference, while also increasing the likelihood that the difference would be so slight as to be meaningless. Moreover, in an industry-sponsored trial of which the lead author is a paid consultant skepticism is warranted. When the symptom scale used might detect clinically insignificant differences, and when several key aspects of study design are weak, the consumer should take VapoRub with a grain of salt.

A major government study found the screening scans saved the life of one person for every 300 current or former smokers who were scanned.\n\nBut now cancer and screening experts are worried that the limited findings will be used by private screening centers to promote the test to a broader group than was studied. That, in turn, could lead to thousands of unnecessary lung scans, causing excess radiation exposure and unnecessary biopsies and surgery.\n\nDr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said he was stunned to hear a radio advertisement for an Atlanta screening center cite the study just a few days after the government had announced the results. The wording of the ad seemed to be aimed at a broad group, ranging from heavy smokers to women who had never smoked, Dr. Brawley said.\n\n“We really need to weigh the harms associated with screening,” he said. “The scientific community still needs to digest this. To take a trial that involves people at high risk for lung cancer and to extrapolate it and say it’s good for people with intermediate or low risk is not appropriate.”\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, focused on a specific high-risk group: 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, who had smoked for at least 30 pack-years. That means someone who smoked one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years or three packs a day for at least 10 years would qualify for the study.\n\nFormer smokers who had accumulated 30 pack-years were included only if they had stopped smoking within the previous 15 years.\n\nThe smokers and former smokers were given either annual CT lung scans or chest X-rays. Compared with conventional X-rays, the CT, or computed tomography, scans create a detailed three-dimensional image of the lungs. The study was stopped when it was found that the scanning group had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than those being screened with X-rays.\n\nBut the early results also showed a downside of scanning: one of every four lung scans showed an abnormality, which often led to additional worry, radiation exposure from follow-up scans and, sometimes, lung biopsies and even risky surgery. But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away.\n\nReading the scans is tricky because harmless nodules can be misinterpreted as suspect lesions. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world.\n\n“There is a learning curve to reading spiral CTs,” Dr. Brawley said. “I’m concerned that some radiologists might be early in that learning curve and some patients may be harmed because of it.”\n\nWhile the study found a benefit to scanning a specific group of high-risk smokers, that doesn’t mean other groups will get the same benefit, says Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. In lower-risk groups, for instance, it’s likely that thousands of people would need to be exposed to the risks of screening before a single life was saved. And it’s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed.\n\n“The aggregate harms to all the people’s lives who are not saved have to be taken into account,” Dr. Bach said. “Even in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn’t.”\n\nLow-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms.\n\nFor now, most consumers who want a scan will have to pay for it themselves, although it is expected that insurance companies eventually will approve scanning for those in high-risk groups. (Medicare officials have indicated that they will soon reconsider paying for the screening tests.) The government has estimated the cost at about $300 a scan, but some centers may charge $1,000 or more.\n\nThe day the government announced the study results, Westside Medical Imaging of Beverly Hills, Calif., issued a press release saying that the study “should once and for all settle the controversy” about whether CT lung scans save lives.\n\nIn the release, Dr. Norman E. Lepor said the scans were an “indispensable” part of annual exams for patients who have smoked for 10 years.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Lepor said that he only offers lung scans to those at high risk, and that he turns people away who are at low risk but want the scan anyway because “they just want to know.”\n\nDr. Lepor said it would be “imprudent” not to incorporate the latest study data into his practice right away.\n\n“There are people who, with good conscience and their take of the data, say it’s not ready for prime time, and there are people who look at the same data and they come to other conclusions,” Dr. Lepor said. “This is not the first study that has supported screening. We know from our own anecdotes that we have saved a lot of lives.”\n\nDr. Lepor said that he had just met a woman who had smoked for 50 years and was concerned about her risk. “She’s the poster person for this test,” he said.\n\nDr. Brawley said he’s worried that the few early press releases and radio advertisements are just the beginning of widespread promotion of screening lung scans.\n\n“It was sort of ominous to be working Sunday evening in my home office and this thing comes on the radio,” he said. “A lot of people run out when there is a new announcement and get the new test. We’re very frightened some people are going to be harmed because of this.”\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on Nov. 16, 2010, on page D5 of the New York edition of The Times.']",One of the best such columns to appear in the ,"These were some of the special elements of this column:

Most of those trials were funded and run by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture Prozac and Effexor — Eli Lilly and Wyeth, respectively.\n\nThey included 12 studies of Prozac in adults and four each in elderly patients and youth, as well as 21 trials of immediate- or extended-release Effexor in adults. About 9,000 participants were included.\n\nMore adults and kids taking Prozac, known generically as fluoxetine, had at least a 50 percent improvement in scores on depression tests after six weeks compared to those assigned to take a placebo pill.\n\nFifty-five percent of adults on Prozac responded to treatment, compared to 34 percent in the placebo group. In youth, 30 percent on Prozac had significant symptom improvement, compared to just six percent of the comparisons.\n\nThe benefits were seen regardless of how severe patients’ symptoms were before starting treatment.\n\nHowever, in the elderly the differences between the treatment and placebo groups were much smaller, and the researchers calculated that 17 older patients would have to be treated with Prozac for one to gain from it.\n\n“Clearly the efficacy of antidepressants is age-dependent, (and) largest, most interestingly, in youth, which I don’t think would be the mainstream view in psychiatry,” Gibbons told Reuters Health.\n\nThe findings, he added, “raise other questions that need to be followed up (including), what’s going on in the elderly?”\n\nBoth types of Effexor, or venlafaxine, also seemed to help adults with mild to severe depression, with slightly more patients responding to the immediate-release dose.\n\nSome of the study’s authors have testified for or received funding from drug companies, though the report itself was funded by national health agencies.\n\nThe researchers said they couldn’t be sure there would be similar improvements with other types of antidepressants — especially given the more limited data in kids and the elderly — or that the longer-term benefits would be as clear.\n\nOne recent study suggested that up to a fifth of patients on the antidepressant Cymbalta (duloxetine) might actually benefit more from placebo pills (see Reuters Health story of December 9, 2011.)\n\nIrving Kirsch, who studies antidepressants and placebos at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the new report didn’t make him more optimistic about the drugs.\n\nIf five or more patients need to be treated with an antidepressant for one to substantially improve, most don’t get much out of it, he pointed out.\n\n“More than 80 percent of the patients are not getting a significant benefit from the drug — either they’re not getting better or they would get the same benefit with placebo,” he told Reuters Health.\n\n“There are alternative treatments for depression that also produce about the same symptom reduction as the drugs do, but without the risk of side effects,” Kirsch added, including psychotherapy and exercise.\n\nStill, Gibbons said that the improvement in symptoms for the average patient wasn’t insignificant.\n\n“Definitely it doesn’t look like antidepressants are placebos,” he concluded.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/AaNJqw Archives of General Psychiatry, online March 5, 2012.']",We applaud the concise and detailed explanation of the study’s results and offer just a few suggestions for improvement.,"Reporters usually don’t write the headlines, but we wish someone would have changed the headline on this story.  The body of the story conveyed important questions – about the number needed to treat – and about differences in treating the elderly – that perhaps were worthy of headline attention.

So a patient who\'s had a prior kidney transplant may be highly sensitized -- meaning they have a large number of the offending antibodies.\n\nIt can also happen to patients who\'ve had blood transfusion or ever been pregnant, Montgomery said.\n\nIt\'s almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. But they might be able to receive a kidney from an incompatible donor if they first undergo an extensive ""desensitization"" process.\n\nThat involves various treatments -- including IV drugs called immune globulin and rituximab -- that try to quash the antibodies that would attack the donor organ.\n\nNow the new research suggests a simple approach -- an infusion of a particular enzyme hours before the transplant -- could offer a better alternative.\n\nResearchers found that the treatment -- dubbed IdeS -- quickly wiped out the dangerous antibodies, allowing all but one of 25 patients to have a successful transplant.\n\nThe findings were published in the Aug. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Funding for the study came from the company developing IdeS -- Hansa Medical.\n\nMontgomery, who was not involved in the study, said he\'s ""never seen anything like it.""\n\n""When you give this, all of the antibodies are gone,"" Montgomery said. ""I\'m hopeful that this will turn out to be a game-changer.""\n\nHowever, he stressed, many questions remain.\n\nCritically, the enzyme does not banish the antibodies forever. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient.\n\nIn the study, 10 patients had an episode of antibody-mediated rejection anywhere from two weeks to five months after their transplant. That means antibodies started to attack the new kidney.\n\nThose patients were all successfully treated with standard anti-rejection drugs, according to the researchers.\n\nStill, it\'s not yet clear how the patients will fare in the long term, said Dr. Julie Ingelfinger, a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nIngelfinger, who wrote an editorial published with the study, echoed Montgomery\'s cautious optimism.\n\nIf larger, longer studies bolster the current findings, she said, ""this could potentially be practice-changing.""\n\n""But,"" Ingelfinger stressed, ""only time will tell.""\n\nLead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary.\n\nBut the findings mark another step forward for patients like these, according to Jordan, who is medical director of the kidney transplant program at Cedars-Sinai, in Los Angeles.\n\nTraditionally, highly sensitized patients in need of a kidney have languished on waiting lists because it\'s so hard to find a compatible donor.\n\nBut in the past 15 years or so, desensitization has emerged as an alternative.\n\nLast year, a landmark study proved that patients who receive transplants after desensitization live significantly longer than those who stay on dialysis.\n\n""The outcomes have been good,"" Jordan said.\n\nBut, he added, there\'s clearly room for improvement.\n\nIngelfinger agreed. ""The desensitization protocols now in use are time-consuming, and they don\'t always work,"" she said, noting that they can leave dangerous antibodies behind.\n\nDesensitization adds about $20,000 to $30,000 to the cost of the transplant, according to the University of Wisconsin\'s transplant center.\n\nThe new approach is quite different, Ingelfinger said.\n\nPatients receive one infusion of an enzyme called IdeS four to six hours before the transplant.\n\nThe enzyme is derived from a strain of Streptococcus bacteria, and it essentially chops up the antibodies that would attack the organ.\n\nJordan acknowledged that the source ""sounds scary,"" but stressed that patients do not receive the bacteria itself -- but an engineered version of the enzyme.\n\nIn all, 25 U.S. and Swedish patients received an infusion of IdeS before their kidney transplant. All but one had a successful transplant, and none had detectable antibodies immediately afterward.\n\nIdeS patients still received additional treatment -- including a week of immune globulin and rituximab infusions.\n\nAnd as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs.\n\nBecause IdeS so readily banishes the offending antibodies, it might make transplants feasible for even the most highly sensitized patients, Montgomery said.\n\nBut the ""$65,000 question"" remains, he said: Can it extend the survival of the donor kidney and, ultimately, patients\' lives?\n\nIdeS is still experimental, and the only way patients could receive it is through a clinical trial. It will be ""a few years"" before it could be more widely available, Montgomery said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Kidney Foundation has more on kidney transplantation.']","The article includes most of the needed cautions, shortcomings and barriers to clinical use of what remains an experimental treatment.","This news article describes a small clinical trial of an enzyme engineered to remove sensitizing antibodies from a patient about to undergo kidney transplantation within a few hours, increasing the chances of transplant success for potentially thousands of patients whose bodies are likely to quickly and forcefully reject a donor organ and for whom it is highly difficult to find a compatible tissue-matched donor. So-called pre-transplant “desensitization” is a strategy that has been around for about 15 years, but the new study involves a one-time, shorter-term, less complex approach than previous efforts.
The article includes most of the needed cautions, shortcomings and barriers to clinical use of what remains an experimental treatment. However, the piece needed a stronger, explicit statement up high in the story that this treatment is clearly not yet ready for prime time, especially to counter the headline, which needed more context.

Oct. 8, 2018 – The Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC) is now offering deep-tissue external thermal therapy in combination with high-precision proton-beam radiotherapy as a potential way to boost survival chances for certain cancer patients. MPTC is the only center in the world to offer these two treatments at the same facility, an advantage to patients because these therapies are typically given within an hour of each other.\n\nResearch has shown that thermal therapy can be especially useful in difficult-to-reach cancers in the abdomen and pelvic region. Studies have found that adding thermal therapy to standard treatments can significantly shrink tumors and can improve survival for some patients. External thermal therapy, or hyperthermia – in the range of 104° up to 110° F. – sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In addition, heat has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immune response.\n\n“We are very pleased to be able to offer deep-tissue thermal therapy, which can be combined with standard radiation therapy as well as proton-beam therapy to enhance the cancer-killing effects of the radiation,” says Zeljko Vujaskovic, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology and director of the Division of Translational Radiation Sciences (DTRS) in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM).\n\n“Early research suggests that adding thermal therapy to proton-beam therapy may be associated with an even greater benefit than when combined with standard radiation therapy, and we are excited to be at the forefront of making this combination therapy available to cancer patients,” says Dr. Vujaskovic, an internationally recognized expert in hyperthermic oncology.\n\nProton therapy is a precise form of radiation therapy that deposits all of its energy within the tumor and allows for less irradiation of noncancerous tissue. MPTC – which is affiliated with the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC) at the University of Maryland Medical Center – is the only proton treatment center in Maryland.\n\nRadiation oncologists at UMGCCC already use external thermal therapy to treat a range of cancers, but do not currently use it for cancers that are deeper in the body.\n\nAccording to Dr. Vujaskovic, the new deep-tissue thermal therapy equipment, which is made by Pyrexar, will be used to treat cancers of the abdominal and pelvic region, including cancer of the bladder, rectum, cervix, ovaries, pancreas and connective tissue, which are known as sarcomas. Patients would typically receive the thermal therapy two times a week for an hour before or after they receive standard (photon) radiation or proton-beam therapy.\n\nThe system heats the tumor tissue to 108° F. with internal and external probes that enable doctors to continuously monitor the temperature. A water-filled applicator is placed over the area to be treated, and non-invasive radio frequency energy is directed at the tumor. The heat causes the blood vessels in the tumor to dilate, bringing more oxygen into the tumor, which makes cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation therapy.\n\nThe acquisition of the deep-tissue thermal therapy system was made possible by donations from Jack and Emily Howell and the Middendorf Foundation, Inc.\n\n“Within the Department of Radiation Oncology and throughout our cancer center, we strive to make every available tool in the cancer-fighting toolbox available to our patients,” says William F. Regine, MD, FACR, FACRO, the Isadore & Fannie Schneider Foxman Endowed Chair and Professor of radiation oncology at UMSOM and chair of radiation oncology at UMGCCC. “By continuing to develop a comprehensive thermal oncology program, we are giving patients more effective treatment options and therefore another reason to hope for better outcomes.”\n\n“The Maryland Proton Treatment Center has achieved another milestone by becoming the first center to offer both deep-thermal therapy and proton therapy,” says E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs at UM Baltimore and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean at UMSOM. “This achievement is a testament to Dr. Vujaskovic’s considerable expertise in hyperthermic oncology and leadership in developing an outstanding thermal oncology program at the University of Maryland. It’s this type of innovation that sets MPTC apart from other proton treatment centers.”\n\nAbout the University of Maryland School of Medicine\n\nCommemorating its 210th Anniversary, the University of Maryland School of Medicine was chartered in 1807 as the first public medical school in the United States. It continues today as one of the fastest growing, top-tier biomedical research enterprises in the world -- with 43 academic departments, centers, institutes, and programs; and a faculty of more than 3,000 physicians, scientists, and allied health professionals, including members of the National Academy of Sciences, and a distinguished recipient of the Albert E. Lasker Award in Medical Research. With an operating budget of more than $1 billion, the School of Medicine works closely in partnership with the University of Maryland Medical Center and Medical System to provide research-intensive, academic and clinically-based care for more than 1.2 million patients each year. The School has over 2,500 students, residents, and fellows, and nearly $450 million in extramural funding, with more than half of its academic departments ranked in the top 20 among all public medical schools in the nation in research funding. As one of the seven professional schools that make up the University of Maryland, Baltimore campus, the School of Medicine has a total workforce of nearly 7,000 individuals. The combined School and Medical System (“University of Maryland Medicine”) has a total budget of $5 billion and an economic impact of nearly $15 billion on the state and local community. The School of Medicine faculty, which ranks as the 8th-highest public medical school in research productivity, is an innovator in translational medicine with 600 active patents and 24 start-up companies. The School works locally, nationally, and globally, with research and treatment facilities in 36 countries around the world. Visit medschool.umaryland.edu/\n\nAbout the Maryland Proton Treatment Center\n\nThe Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC) offers proton therapy – a highly advanced and precise form of radiation therapy that can increase radiation dose to tumor while decreasing dose to healthy, surrounding tissue – to the Baltimore/Washington region and beyond. It is a highly effective treatment for a wide range of localized tumors such as those found in the brain, base of the skull, head and neck area, eye tumors, tumors of the esophagus, lung, prostate, liver, breast, spinal cord, as well as gastrointestinal malignancies. It is also an important treatment option for children with cancer.\n\nAt MPTC, each treatment room is equipped with the most advanced form of “pencil beam” proton therapy, which essentially paints the radiation onto the tumor while stopping precisely at the site of the tumor. Proton therapy is performed on an outpatient basis and is a well-tolerated, non-invasive treatment that can reduce side effects. It can be used in conjunction with other modalities of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery. MPTC offers a robust clinical trial program to all its patients to further evidence-based medicine.']",The University of Maryland Medical Center is the latest to make an evidence-free claim that its proton beam treatment beats other types of cancer therapies.,"Proton beam therapy has been in vogue for the past few years due to promises to provide more precise radiation therapy, theoretically leading to fewer side effects. A news release from the University of Maryland Medical Center/School of Medicine claims that the center is the only facility in the world to offer both proton beam therapy and thermal therapy, another experimental cancer treatment, in the same facility. 
 As we’ve discussed before, there are few definitive studies proving that proton beam therapy is more effective and safer than conventional cancer treatments. Regardless, hospitals around the country have invested massive amounts of money to be able to provide this treatment, which can lead to large bills for patients. 
The jury is also still out on thermal therapy, also called hyperthermia. The American Cancer Society considers hyperthermia to be an experimental treatment, and notes that it is still being reviewed in clinical trials.

Yet health-conscious Americans despise them, designing entire diets just to cut them out.\n\nBut out of the pile of cast-off carbs, there are some you should keep. New research around a certain kind of carb, called “resistant starch,” suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight.\n\nWhen we eat refined carbohydrates, like white bread and cookies, our bodies absorb them very quickly, and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells. Eat a lot of them, and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them—which is why we gain weight on high-carb diets.\n\nBut that’s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. These kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine (where most food is digested) and head to the large intestine (also known as the colon) to be metabolized. There, they’re fermented and turned into short-chain fatty acids, which the body burns as energy. Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics—food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThose benefits—getting digested slower, being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria—set resistant starch apart. Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.\n\n“Certain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,” says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. “In my belief, that’s what’s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.”\n\nLuckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.\n\nGetty Images; Illustration by Marisa Gertz for TIME\n\nMost intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. “Cooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,” Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. “The ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,” Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.\n\nIn all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a Nutrition Journal study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant—much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.\n\nGet The Brief.

To Arciero’s surprise, after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein, they experienced an increase in fat burning, compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes. “After you eat a meal that’s principally carbohydrate, the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual,” he says. Adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller, they found—which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight. “If you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg, or whey protein, or pea protein, or chicken or Greek yogurt, that’s a pretty powerful combination,” Arciero says.\n\nIt’s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people lose weight. But the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety. “The potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don’t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,” Arciero says—especially when it’s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.\n\nWrite to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com.""]",This story was a light meal of information that didn’t back up the assertion made in the headline.,"The story describes a single small study of 70 women followed for three hours after a meal containing “resistant starch” and whey protein.

Alford of the University of Iowa, Iowa City, and colleagues say the results suggest that testing for blood flow disturbances in the lungs may provide an early warning for smokers most likely to develop the disease.\n\nEmphysema is an incurable, progressive lung disease that primarily affects smokers and causes shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Although smoking is by far the most common cause of emphysema, some heavy smokers do not develop the disease for unknown reasons.\n\nRecent research suggests that certain people may be more susceptible to the disease because of differences in how their lung tissue responds to inhaling tobacco.\n\nIn this study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that inhaling tobacco smoke inflamed parts of the lungs and altered blood flow as the smoker's lungs attempted to get oxygen.\n\nResearchers say areas of low blood flow in inflamed lung tissue can promote tissue damage and inhibit repair of damaged tissues, which eventually develops into the symptoms of emphysema.\n\nIn the study, researchers used MDCT scans to measure blood flow differences in 17 nonsmokers and 24 smokers. Based on differences in blood flow, researchers could tell the differences between people who had never smoked, people who smoked and had no signs of emphysema, and people who smoked and had subtle, early signs of emphysema.\n\nBased on the scans, people who had early signs of emphysema had the most disturbed blood flow patterns in otherwise healthy lungs.\n\nIf confirmed by further studies, researchers say this type of testing could help determine who is most at risk of developing emphysema, measure the extent of the disease, and target and test new treatments for the disease.""]","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">This story is an example of twisting a piece of basic research in order to create the unfounded impression that it could be clinically useful in the near future.</span>","1clip_filelist.xml""/>



 
This story repeats a vague promise contained in a journal news release that a CT scan could provide smokers with an earlier warning of emphysema risk. The actual research article makes no such claims of clinical usefulness. Indeed, the article and the news from the researcher’s university both emphasize that the point of this work is to offer clues to the underlying mechanism of smoking-related emphysema, to aid research into genetic variations that may be linked to lung disease risk, and to help develop new treatments by identifying and tracking subtle changes in lung blood flow.
Not only does the research itself not discuss providing smokers with warnings, it is not clear how such “warnings” would be more useful than the blanket advice to smokers that they should quit. Indeed, by suggesting the test could identify smokers who are less likely to develop emphysema, it could be that this sort of test would actually make some smoker more complacent, leaving them vulnerable to heart disease, stroke and other tobacco-related harms that are outside the scope of this “test.”
The story also fails to mention that CT scans produce a small, but real, increase in the risk of cancer.

""We cannot sustain this forever.""\n\nHis group on Monday released results of its first-ever head-injury survey of more than 750 member high schools from 2015-2016 sports. It received data from nearly every school.\n\nThe association started the program last fall with 62 high schools. It includes baseline testing of athletes in football and other sports to help with concussion diagnosis.\n\nThe association spent $10,000 last school year to start the program. It expects to spend $30,000 this year but will have fewer schools — 34 — involved because of the expense and commitment. They will also concentrate on sports that have the highest incidence of head injury.\n\n""I hope that we can demonstrate their value and encourage sponsorship, grant support,"" Roberts said. ""But it\'s going to take I think some investment by the people in the communities. The moms and dads are going to have to think that this is important and worth to contributing to make the programs safer for their children.""\n\nHere is some information on what\'s happening in Michigan:\n\nWHAT IS BASELINE TESTING\n\nBaseline testing is a combination of memory, reaction time, attention and stress assessments. It is done in major pro sports because it is considered an objective and individualized tool to help decide whether to remove an athlete from a game. While all states have laws that address preventing concussions in youth sports, many are weak and none require baseline testing.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS\n\nMichigan schools reported 4,452 head injuries in boys and girls sport, or 5.9 per school. Contact sports had the most head injuries. Ranking first was 11-player football with 49 head injuries per 1,000 participants, followed by ice hockey with 38 and 8-player football with 34. Girls soccer had 30 injuries per 1,000 participants, and girls basketball ranked fifth with 29 injuries per 1,000.\n\nBut that is likely only part of the picture. Health and safety advocates fear concussions often go undetected in high schools because of inconsistent protocols at districts unwilling or unable to spend money for detection. It\'s often on players to self-report concussions, or on coaches, who have many responsibilities and sometimes little training, to recognize symptoms.\n\nWHY NOT ALL SCHOOLS\n\nSchools typically don\'t argue with the benefit of testing, but cash-strapped districts often say the cost of offering such programs is prohibitive.\n\nPROGRAMS AVAILABLE\n\nMany sideline concussion-testing programs are on the market. Michigan is testing the Illinois-based King-Devick Test affiliated with the Mayo Clinic and Maryland-based XLNTbrain Sport. The association provides them for free to the participating schools. Long term, Roberts thinks the association could fund it in part with a $3 to $5 fee per student. But the association is also working to get grants.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nBaselines with the XLNTbrain Sport are determined during 30-minute sessions by athletes at computers. The tests measure reaction time, attention, memory and stress by completing a series of exercises that involve such things as word recognition. Athletes suspected of a head injury undergo a sideline assessment done in about five minutes with an iPhone or tablet app. It assesses memory by providing words for the athlete to remember. It asks questions that require the athlete to recall the hit. The athletes also hold the phone as they stand for 20 seconds with eyes open and then closed to check balance. That assessment is compared to the athlete\'s baseline data to help determine whether they can return to play.\n\nWHAT\'S NEXT IN MICHIGAN\n\nRoberts hopes that universities, health care systems and the National Federation of State High School Associations will help analyze the data from last year and this year. The association plans specifically to work with Michigan State University\'s Institute for the Study of Youth Sports to explore possible changes and additions in coaches\' education.\n\n————\n\nFollow Roger Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/rogschneider']","The story does a nice job of summarizing the results of a data collection effort for concussions among athletes, but treats the concept of baseline testing uncritically.","Concussions incurred during sporting events in middle and high schools may have substantial health impacts on young athletes. Recognition of those impacts has grown exponentially in the US, generating earnest efforts to find ways to diagnose possible problems during games, before an athlete returns to the fray and runs the risk of making things worse. A number of companies now market baseline testing products, which usually involve a “baseline” neurological exam at the start of the season. Later, if the athlete is injured during a game, a shorter “sideline” exam can be conducted to compare to the original exam.
This AP story reports on a Michigan-based organization that made baseline testing available to schools in order to gather data over the course of a year about the frequency of potential concussions across ages, genders and type of sport.
The story does a nice job of summarizing the results of that study but treats the concept of baseline testing uncritically. Can the brief sideline diagnostic efforts in the midst of a game actually detect a problem in the making?  It depends on who you “ask.” Baseline testing is currently fashionable in medical circles. The Journal of the American Association (JAMA) has published articles concluding that baseline procedures are valid tests of cognitive function in athletes, a conclusion disputed by articles in other journals. The CDC has a webpage explaining baseline testing that offers details about when to do the tests but with no efficacy critique. And web pages from “The Sports Concussion Institute” tout the testing as evidence-based.
But is it?  We could find no controlled trials showing that neuropsychological testing improves outcomes after sports-related concussions.  And that, in turn, may mean that baseline testing is still a form of expert opinion masquerading as evidence-based science. Since companies are selling baseline testing products, the possibility of industry influence on the conduct of research exists. These details were needed in the to story to present a full picture of what’s at stake.

He has a great job as the creative director of an advertising firm in New York City. He enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.\n\nAnd it has all been possible, he says, because for the past six years he has been taking a drug called ketamine.\n\nBefore ketamine, James was unable to work or focus his thoughts. His mind was filled with violent images. And his mood could go from ebullient to dark in a matter of minutes.\n\nKetamine ""helped me get my life back,"" says James, who asked that we not use his last name to protect his career.\n\nKetamine was developed as a human and animal anesthetic in the 1960s. And almost from the time it reached the market it has also been used as a mind-bending party drug.\n\nBut ketamine\'s story took a surprising turn in 2006, when researchers at the National Institutes of Health showed that an intravenous dose could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours. Since then, doctors have prescribed ketamine ""off label"" to thousands of depressed patients who don\'t respond to other drugs.\n\nAnd pharmaceutical companies are testing several new ketamine-related drugs to treat depression. Johnson & Johnson expects to seek approval for its nasal spray esketamine later this year, though the approval would be limited to use in a clinical setting.\n\nMeanwhile, doctors have begun trying ketamine on patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders other than depression. And there is now growing evidence it can help people with anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and perhaps even obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n""I think it\'s actually one of the biggest advances in psychiatry in a very long time,"" says Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Developmental Biopsychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital.\n\nKetamine may also offer new hope for people like James who have symptoms of several different psychiatric disorders.\n\nJames had a happy childhood, he says. But his thoughts were out of control. ""I always felt like I was crossing a freeway and my thoughts were just racing past me,"" he says.\n\nHe spent much of his childhood terrified of ""an unknown, an ambiguous force out there."" The fear was ""overwhelming,"" he says. ""I literally slept with the cover over my head with just room to breathe through my mouth until I went to college.""\n\nAnd there was something else about James: his body temperature.\n\n""I overheated constantly,"" he says. ""I would wear shorts all year long. In my 20s in my apartment I would sleep with the windows open in the middle of the winter.""\n\nIn his late 20s, James saw a doctor who told him he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. So he started taking stimulants.\n\nAt first, the pills helped him focus. Then they didn\'t, no matter how many he took.\n\nHe\'d done well as an idea guy in the advertising industry. But now James was trying to work at home, and it wasn\'t going well.\n\n""ADHD pills will make you interested in anything,"" he says. ""So I was putting the desk together and taking the desk apart. I was putting a laptop stand together and taking it apart. I was going in a massive downward spiral.""\n\nJames had always suffered from mood swings. But now they were rapid and extreme. And he couldn\'t stop thinking about gruesome scenarios, like a murderer coming for his family.\n\n""My wife took a summer off to be with me because she was scared of what was going to happen to me,"" he says. ""She would go to work for a few hours, then rush home. There would be times I\'d call her just screaming, \'Please come home. I can\'t get through another minute.\' ""\n\nEventually, James found his way to Dr. Demitri Papolos, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\n""He was like a whirling dervish when he came into my office,"" Papolos says. ""He was extremely fearful and scanning the environment all the time and he overheated at the drop of a hat.""\n\nPapolos diagnosed James with a variant of bipolar disorder he calls the ""fear of harm phenotype."" It typically appears in childhood and often doesn\'t respond to traditional psychiatric drugs.\n\nBut Papolos has found that the condition does respond to ketamine. ""It\'s been transformational,"" he says.\n\nIn January, Papolos published a study of 45 children with the problem. They inhaled a nasal mist containing ketamine about twice a week. Nearly all got dramatically better.\n\nScientists still aren\'t sure why ketamine works, but there\'s evidence that it encourages the brain to rewire, to alter the connections between cells. That process has been linked to recovery from depression. And it may also explain why ketamine helps people who have symptoms associated with several different psychiatric disorders.\n\n""I think it\'s having multiple effects, and that means it\'s probably useful for multiple different disorders,"" Teicher says.\n\nOne of those effects involves a part of the brain involved in temperature regulation. And that could explain why patients like James usually stop overheating once they are taking ketamine.\n\nJames started taking a ketamine nasal spray every other day. He says his response was dramatic.\n\n""One day I turn to my wife and I\'m like, \'I feel calm today. I don\'t know if it\'s the sun coming in, I don\'t know if it\'s just the way we\'re sitting here, but I feel like I could go and sit at the computer and work.\' ""\n\nThe next day, James did sit down at his computer. A month later, he was back at work.']","The story makes sweeping statements, without support, favoring the use of ketamine to treat a vast array of ills.","Can ketamine help people with depression and other psychiatric diagnoses? Unfortunately, this story doesn’t answer that question, beyond vague claims about one patient’s outcome. It skips any discussion of limitations of the studies or caveats about their conclusions. Importantly, it does not tell readers about the side effects reported in these and other studies. The only two experts quoted are advocates of expanded ketamine use. One of them has applied for a patent on a ketamine delivery device, which is not disclosed.
There is little that differentiates this story from others reported by the same journalist on numerous occasions; for example, in early 2012, later in 2012, 2015 and again last year.

Breast cancer afflicts 1 in 8 women in their lifetime and 1 in 25 die from this disease. Although a number of randomized trials demonstrate the clear benefits of mammography screening in women up to age 74 on reducing mortality, data are sparse in women over the age of 74, especially minorities. In 2010, 41 percent of breast cancer deaths occurred in the more than 19 million women who are between the ages of 65 to 84 years.\n\nIn a new study published in the American Journal of Medicine, Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., senior author and first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University, indicates that black and white women ages 75 to 84 years who had an annual mammogram had lower 10-year breast cancer mortality than corresponding women who had biennial or no/irregular mammograms.\n\nAmong elder women, the American Cancer Society and the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend regular mammography for ages 65 to 74.\n\nAlthough many guidelines rely on self-reports, Hennekens and his collaborators from Baylor College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College, used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program file linked to the Medicare administrative claims file, which allowed them to identify screening mammography use from 1995 to 2009 from 64,384 non-Hispanic women (4,886 black and 59,498 white). These linked files also permitted them to explore breast cancer mortality differences between elderly black or white women who self-selected for regular annual or biennial mammography screening. The researchers selected 69 as the lower age limit because Medicare coverage of the general population begins at age 65, and the exposure of interest was regular mammography screening in the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThree mutually exclusive categories were defined: no or irregular mammography; biennial mammography; and annual mammography. They looked at data from non-Hispanic, white or black women; Hispanics were not included because Hispanic white women have substantially lower mortality than non-Hispanic whites, and the number of Hispanic blacks is small. The researchers also measured socioeconomic status looking at median household income, the percentage of individuals living below the poverty level, and whether or not they had a high school education.\n\nOther significant findings from the study show that:\n\nWhite women who had died tended to be older, to have a later stage diagnosis, to have received chemotherapy, and to have a higher socioeconomic status.\n\nWhite women who died were less likely to have undergone surgery and receive radiation therapy.\n\nSimilar characteristics were seen in black women as in white women.\n\n69- to 84-year-old women receiving regular annual screening mammography during the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis had consistently lower five-year and 10-year risks of breast cancer mortality than women with no or irregular screening regardless of race.\n\n10-year risks were more than three times higher among white and more than two times higher among blacks aged 69 to 84 years with no or irregular screening compared with annual screening.\n\nHennekens notes that further research is needed, but that in the future, the use of regular claims-based surveillance for mammography as a source of data may offer some unique advantages over self-reports.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, according to Science Watch, Hennekens was the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former fellows and/or trainees. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives, which placed him two ahead of professor Jonas Salk ranked No. 83 for the development of the polio vaccine. In 2013, he received the ""Fries Prize for Improving Health"" and in 2014, he received the Alton Ochsner Award for his pioneering work on smoking and health. In 2015, he was ranked the No. 14 ""Top Scientist in the World"" based on his H-index of 173.\n\n###\n\nAbout Florida Atlantic University:']",This news release claims the evidence is in that regular mammograms after age 74 save lives. But does the evidence presented really show that?,"Researcher Charles H. Hennekens, MD looms large in this news release — perhaps larger than the study itself.
This news release issued on behalf of a prestigious researcher — one said to have “saved more than 1.1 million lives” according to Science Heroes — claims the evidence is in that regular mammograms after age 74 save lives. But does the evidence presented really show that?
We expected to see many different studies and opinions released when the USPTF announced its final recommendations on screening with mammograms, and we were not disappointed.
This release raises some important points but it also seems to be touting the professional reputation of the study’s senior author (ranked ahead of Jonas Salk in terms of lifesaving prowess!) when it should have devoted more space to cost and limitations, and making a stronger case for the benefits and evidence.

Not so. Previous research has suggested that exercise can improve memory and reverse muscle loss in older adults, among other benefits. And a study out Monday finds that a regular program of physical activity reduces the time spent with mobility-limiting disability.\n\nResearchers took more than 1,600 sedentary people between 70 and 89 years old who had some functional limitations, but who could walk about a quarter of a mile in 15 minutes or less, unassisted by another person or a walker. (Canes were OK.)\n\nHalf of the participants got a health education program involving regular in-person sessions and some stretching exercises, while the other group was told to aim for 150 minutes of aerobic activity as well as strength, flexibility and balance training both at the study\'s facilities and at home. ""Walking was the cornerstone of the program,"" says Thomas Gill, a professor of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the study, which appears in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe study followed participants for about 2.7 years, and found that the physical activity program cut the amount of time that people spent with a ""major mobility disability"" — defined as being unable to walk a quarter mile — by 25 percent compared to the education program. Previous findings from the same study showed that the exercise program lowered the risk of becoming disabled in the first place; this one showed that it sped recovery from an episode of disability and lowered the risk of subsequent episodes.\n\n""They\'ve done a really nice job of showing the incredible power of physical activity,"" says Bradley Cardinal, a professor of kinesiology at Oregon State University who wasn\'t involved with the study. ""It\'s the secret ingredient to successful aging in terms of quality of life."" An editorial accompanying the study, by the University of California, San Francisco\'s Patricia Katz and the University of South Carolina\'s Russell Pate, also noted that people who engage in physical activity have a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, depression, cognitive impairment and functional decline.\n\nThe exercise program pretty closely followed the government\'s recommendations for all adults, including older ones: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, plus two strength sessions that hit all the major muscle groups.\n\nBut most Americans don\'t get that much exercise, and that becomes increasingly true as people age. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 28 percent of those 75 and up meet the recommendation for aerobic activity, and only 8 percent also did the suggested amount of strength training.\n\nCardinal says older adults need to realize that exercise can greatly improve their quality of life by maximizing function as long as possible. But he says that many believe that older age is for relaxing and that physical activity is somehow dangerous or unnatural. That belief ""is pervasive among older adults,"" he says, even though for many of them, meeting the minimum requirements ""is doable.""\n\nSemantics can help. ""We try to frame this as more physical activity than exercise,"" says Gill. ""We talk with older folks and many say, \'I can\'t exercise, but maybe I can become more physically active.\' "" Study participants were advised to ""start low and go slow,"" and some were even able to get rid of their canes after six months of exercise, which Gill says they found particularly rewarding.\n\nPhysicians can also help. ""Prescribing exercise may be just as important as prescribing medications — perhaps even more important in some cases,"" the editorial said. The authors called on medical schools to ""start preparing students to prescribe exercise as effectively as they prescribe statins, and for health systems to support physicians in addressing inactivity just as they provide support in addressing other health risks."" (The American College of Sports Medicine has an ""Exercise is Medicine"" initiative to help physicians integrate exercise recommendations into their treatment plans.)\n\nThere are also some basic behavioral strategies for getting yourself to get moving, no matter your age, including giving yourself an incentive to change and engineering your environment to encourage the activity.\n\nKatherine Hobson is a freelance health and science writer based in Brooklyn, N.Y. She\'s on Twitter: @katherinehobson']",We also wanted to see more specifics on the benefits measured by the study.,"This story focuses on a study showing that elderly persons recovering from a disability get back to normal 25 percent sooner if they participate in a program of physical activity including “150 minutes of aerobic activity as well as strength, flexibility and balance training” per week. It points out that “walking was the cornerstone of the program.”
While it described the program in helpful terms, the story was light on the study’s specific findings, and seemed to assume that all people in this age group would see comparable results. Also, we would have been more satisfied if the story had mentioned early on that people in this age group should consult with their physicians before undertaking any kind of exercise program.

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don\'t need. Nearly one in three adults in the U.S. has prehypertension, blood pressure higher than normal but not considered high yet.\n\nThe scans detect levels of calcium in the heart\'s arteries, and the physicians suggest those people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment, whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively, depending on their other heart disease risk factors.\n\nIn the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient.\n\n""If a health care provider wants to target blood pressure in a patient with traditional heart disease risk factors and above-normal blood pressure, he or she can look at coronary artery calcium to help with tiebreakerlike decisions,"" says J. William McEvoy, M.B.B.Ch., M.H.S., assistant professor of medicine and member of the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""Our study, along with others, such as SPRINT and HOPE, positions cardiac risk and coronary artery calcium as helpful ways to determine if a given patient would either benefit from more intensive blood pressure control or do just fine with a more traditional blood pressure target.""\n\nIn late 2015, the SPRINT trial showed improved outcomes for participants with increased risk for heart disease whose physicians targeted their systolic (the top number) blood pressures to 120 millimeters of mercury, rather than the traditional 140 millimeters of mercury. But not all people deemed ""higher risk"" by traditional methods may need to be aggressively treated, McEvoy says. Some people react poorly to higher doses of blood pressure medicines and experience side effects, such as sexual dysfunction, dizziness, falls, weakness and more. And the risk factor equations that determine whether certain people are at higher risk and should be treated more intensively with blood pressure medications may have inaccuracies on the individual level, says McEvoy. ""We can predict that about 15 out of every 100 people with a particular risk score will die of a heart attack, but the equations don\'t tell us which of those people will be one of the actual 15; they don\'t give us personalized information,"" says McEvoy.\n\nConventionally, coronary artery calcium scores have informed physicians\' decisions of whether to put a patient on statins, but the researchers say they haven\'t been evaluated before for their potential ability to determine blood pressure treatment. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Participants were an average of 65 years old, and 48 percent were men. Thirty-five percent were white, 32 percent were African-American, 22 percent were Hispanic and 11 percent were Chinese-American. At the beginning of the study, investigators measured their blood pressure and performed a cardiac CT scan to determine coronary artery calcium scores. They also calculated each participant\'s heart disease risk with the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Algorithm, which uses traditional risk factors, such as race, age, sex, cholesterol levels and family history of disease. About once a year for 10 years, an interviewer contacted each participant or a family member to determine heart disease diagnosis, hospitalizations or deaths. After about 10 years, the participants had 642 heart disease events, such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke and death.\n\nThe researchers divided the participants by their coronary artery calcium scores into one of three groups: those with a score of zero, those with a score of one to 100 and those with a score greater than 100. Then, they looked at the number of heart disease-related events in each calcium score category broken down by blood pressure range and calculated heart disease risk. Low heart disease risk was classified as a less than 15 percent chance of a heart disease event over the next 10 years, and high risk was 15 percent or greater risk of a heart disease event. To get the event rate, the investigators divided the number of events in each category by the amount of people in the study multiplied by the length of time they spent in the study, known as a person-year.\n\nParticipants with calcium scores of zero with a high calculated risk of heart disease had a relatively low actual event rate after the 10-year study. For example, according to the researchers, those with systolic blood pressures below 140 millimeters of mercury and no calcium had an event rate of 12.7 events per 1,000 person-years, and similar people with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 159 millimeters of mercury had an event rate of 13.6 events per 1,000 person-years.\n\nIn contrast, participants with systolic blood pressure under 140 millimeters of mercury -- below the current cutoff for treatment -- and rated with a low predicted risk of heart disease who had a calcium score over 100 had a high actual event rate of 19.7 events per 1,000 person-years. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment.\n\nParticipants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores. The researchers say this demonstrates that calcium scores may only be useful in guiding more personalized blood pressure treatment for patients with mild high blood pressure -- the gray zone -- not those with high blood pressure.\n\n""It may be that if patients are in that blood pressure treatment gray zone with a high risk score but their coronary artery calcium score is zero, then they don\'t need to be treated aggressively to 120 millimeters of mercury and can be treated to 140 instead,"" says McEvoy. ""But if patients have a high calcium score and are in the gray zone, then it would make sense to go with 120 as a treatment goal.""\n\nThe researchers caution that results are from an observational study, and a randomized trial would be needed to confirm the recommendations.\n\nCoronary artery calcium scans aren\'t usually covered by insurance and can range in cost from $100 to $400. The scans use radiation, so there is a very small cancer risk for susceptible individuals.\n\nAbout 70 million adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure -- a systolic blood pressure over 140 millimeters of mercury -- putting them at increased risk for heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and kidney disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n###\n\nAdditional authors on the study included Seth Martin, Zeina Dardari, Wendy Post, Khurram Nasir and Michael Blaha of Johns Hopkins; Michael Miedema of the Minneapolis Heart Institute; Veit Sandfort of the National Institutes of Health; Joseph Yeboah of Wake Forest Baptist Health; Matthew Budoff of the University of California, Los Angeles; David Goff of the Colorado School of Public Health; and Bruce Psaty of the University of Washington.\n\nThe study was funded by the P.J.

A new study says it doesn't help,"['If taking more vitamin and mineral supplements is part of your plan for a healthier new year, a new study may prompt you to reconsider.\n\nResearchers who scoured the medical literature for evidence that calcium and vitamin D pills could help prevent bone fractures came up empty.\n\nTheir analysis focused on adults older than age 50 who lived on their own (that is, not in a nursing home or other type of residential care facility). Fractures are a serious health concern for this population — previous studies have found that about 40% of women in this age group will wind up with at least one “major osteoporotic fracture” at some point in their lives, and that among adults who break a hip, 20% died within a year of their injury.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Jia-Guo Zhao of Tianjin Hospital in northeastern China, combed through clinical trials, systematic reviews and other reports published in the last decade, since late 2006. They identified 51,145 people who were included in studies assessing the role of calcium and/or vitamin D in preventing bone fractures.\n\nTheir findings appear in Tuesday’s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.\n\nAmong the 14 trials that pitted calcium supplements against either a placebo or no treatment, there was no statistically significant relationship between use of the mineral (in pill form) and the risk of suffering a hip fracture. Nor was there any clear link between calcium supplements and fractures involving the spine or other bones.\n\nEven when the researchers accounted for each study participant’s gender, past history of bone fractures, the amount of calcium they consumed in their diets and the dose of the calcium pills they took (if they did), there was still no sign that supplements were helpful.\n\nAn additional 17 trials examined the role of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium. Once again, they found no statistically significant link between supplement use and hip fracture risk. Ditto for fractures in the spine and elsewhere.\n\nUpon drilling down to certain subgroups, they found that for people who started out with at least 20 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood, adding more vitamin D through supplements was associated with a greater risk of hip fractures. The same was true for people who took high doses of vitamin D supplements just once a year.\n\nFinally, there were 13 trials involving people who took a combined calcium-vitamin D supplement. As before, there was no statistically significant link between supplement use and the risk for any kind of fracture or combination of fractures. That held up even when accounting for gender, past fractures, supplement dose, dietary calcium or baseline blood levels of vitamin D.\n\nThe researchers noted that thousands of people in this final group were participants in the Women’s Health Initiative, a long-term study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the U.S. Earlier reports based on data gathered by the Women’s Health Initiative found that calcium and vitamin D supplements were associated with a lower risk of fractures, but only for women who took hormone therapy after menopause. To get a clearer picture of the direct link (if any) between supplements and fracture risk, Zhao and his colleagues opted not to include data from women on hormone therapy.\n\nIt’s still possible that calcium and vitamin D supplements are useful for people who live in nursing homes or other residential facilities, the study authors wrote. Such people are more likely to have osteoporosis, due to a combination of poor diet, less sun exposure (which the body needs to synthesize vitamin D) and other factors.\n\nBut for older adults who live on their own, they wrote, the results are clear: “These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements.”\n\nCAPTION Revelers joined community members and indigenous leaders from around the world at the Symbiosis Gathering in Big Summit Prairie, Ore., to mark the Great American Eclipse.

Reporting on a large review study, this Los Angeles Times article walks readers through the conflicting advice and evidence about calcium and vitamin D supplements. Both compounds play roles in bone health and the routinely accepted claim is that supplementation can help prevent bone breaks in older people. This new meta-analysis shows that claim is not supported by evidence: not for calcium pills, vitamin D pills, or the two in combination.
The story is well-done on several points, particularly on explaining how this study worked and what it found.

(Embargoed until 12:30 p.m., June 8, 2015) - A novel radionuclide drug tackles the challenge of prostate cancer imaging and takes a turn as a cancer-killing therapy for tumors in and out of the prostate, according to research presented during the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI).\n\nThe drug works by delivering diagnostic- or therapy-grade radionuclides to cells that express a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), found on the surface of prostate cancer cells and their metastatic counterparts throughout the body. Clinicians can diagnose or stage disease and monitor therapy with the aid of a special hybrid scanner used to perform minimally invasive positron emission tomography (PET).\n\n""Prostate cancer still represents one of the main causes for cancer-related deaths among men,"" said Matthias Eder, PhD, co-author of the study and a researcher in the division of radiopharmaceutical chemistry at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. ""The diagnosis and therapy of metastatic prostate cancer is still challenging. The current clinical methods are not sensitive enough for detecting disease beyond the prostate, but we are convinced that this novel theranostic radiotracer represents a significant step forward that could have a major impact on the future of prostate cancer care.""\n\nThe PSMA-inhibiting theranostic agent, called PSMA-617, is still in its initial stages, but it could be ideal for the treatment of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancers, which are notoriously difficult to control and linked to poor prognosis. Options for these patients are few, and they come with substantial adverse effects. Diagnosis and therapy with the theranostic agent PSMA-617 could offer more effective and sensitive visualization, better staging and significantly higher therapeutic potential. To be clear, other PSMA-based theranostics have reached the research bench, but previous contenders had too many limitations in terms of instability in live subjects, a lack of imaging contrast between targeted tissue and background signal and increased PSMA-associated binding to normal organs such as the kidneys. This new radionuclide drug shows strong binding to the protein PSMA and is readily and safely taken up by malignant PSMA-positive tumors. PSMA-617 could represent a watershed moment for prostate cancer theranostics.\n\nFor this research, scientists first imaged mice with an imaging-grade radionuclide, gallium-68, to assess the diagnostic value of PSMA-617. Diagnostic imaging was followed by a therapy-grade radionuclide, lutetium-177, which delivers a more powerful dose of radiation that penetrates and destroys the cells and tissues of tumors when combined with PSMA-617. This phase was followed by a first-in-human clinical trial of both imaging and therapy in a single person.\n\nResults of the human study showed that imaging was effective for the evaluation of metastatic prostate cancer, and subsequent therapy resulted in a drop in prostate-specific antigen levels from 38.0 to 4.6 nanograms per milliliter. Positive response to therapy was verified via combined PET and computed tomography (PET/CT), a hybrid imaging system that shows both functional and structural aspects of the body.\n\nApproximately one out of seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, according to 2015 statistics from the American Cancer Society. About 220,800 new prostate cancer diagnoses and 27,540 prostate-cancer-related deaths are expected to occur in the U.S. this year.\n\n###\n\nScientific Paper 63: ""PSMA-617 - a novel theranostic PSMA inhibitor for both diagnosis and endoradiotherapy of prostate cancer,"" M. Benesova, M. Schäfer, U. Bauder-Wüst, K. Kopka, M. Eder, Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; C. Kratochwil, A. Afshar-Oromieh, W. Mier, U. Haberkorn, Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; SNMMI\'s 62nd Annual Meeting, June 6-10, 2015, Baltimore, Md.\n\nAbout the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging\n\nThe Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) is an international scientific and medical organization dedicated to raising public awareness about nuclear medicine and molecular imaging, a vital element of today\'s medical practice that adds an additional dimension to diagnosis, changing the way common and devastating diseases are understood and treated and helping provide patients with the best health care possible.']","The frothy language in this release — “new hope,” “watershed moment,” “major impact,” – doesn’t square up with the reality that only one patient was treated, and we don’t know if he benefited in any meaningful way.","This news release reports on a paper presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging on a radionuclide drug that could be used both for imaging and therapy in advanced prostate cancer. The drug works by targeting cells that produce a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen and varying dosages can either be used for radio imaging or to target cancer cells. An initial trial of this drug yielded a drop in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels from 38.0 to 4.6 nanograms per milliliter. This result was verified by PET scan and computed tomography.
These results could certainly warrant a news release calling attention to this novel research. However, we thought the execution could have been handled more carefully. Our main concern with this release is the disparity between the language used — for example, the headline touts “new hope for advanced prostate cancer” — and the actual research, which is based on treatment of a single person resulting in a drop in PSA levels. The release takes five paragraphs to tell us that the study involved only one person; it omits important details about his treatment; and it didn’t mention how long he lived or if, indeed, he is still alive. That’s a flimsy foundation for anyone with advanced prostate cancer to base their hopes.

In many countries, the rate drops to less than 10 percent.\n\nIn the U.S., the National Institute of Mental Health estimates 16.2 million adults experienced at least one major depressive episode in 2016. Approximately 37 percent of these people received no treatment.\n\nIn the U.K, where a number of the study authors are based, at least one million more people could benefit from drugs or psychotherapy, senior author John Geddes said.\n\nSome drugs more effective than others\n\nThe researchers analyzed existing studies of 21 different drugs, and found some were much more effective than others.\n\nDrugs ranged from more than one third more effective than a placebo to more than twice as effective. The best performers included amitriptyline and escitalopram, while the worst included fluoxetine—commonly sold under the trade name Prozac—and reboxetine, which is not approved for sale in the U.S.\n\nA complex treatment picture\n\nThe results add up to a complex treatment picture for what authors called “one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults.”\n\nAntidepressants do not improve symptoms in about 40 percent of people, study author Andrea Cipriani of Oxford University told a press briefing.\n\nWhile these results should reassure many people with depression that antidepressants can be effective, “this does not necessarily mean antidepressants should always be the first line of treatment,” he said.\n\nTalking therapies are thought to be about as effective as antidepressant medication, but these are often much more expensive.\n\nExperts not involved in the research agreed the results were significant.\n\nHelen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the U.K.’s Royal College of GPs, expressed concern about the stigma surrounding antidepressant use.\n\nShe said in a statement: “Taking antidepressants is frequently portrayed as a negative thing or something done only when other therapies are not available or have failed, but this in itself can add to the unfortunate stigma that sometimes exists around people with mental health conditions.”\n\nBut she also urged caution. “Although antidepressants are of proven benefit—as this study shows,” she said, “no doctor wants their patients to become reliant on medication.”\n\nPutting a long-held controversy to bed\n\nCarmine Pariante, a professor at the UK’s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience and spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the study ""finally puts to bed the controversy on antidepressants.""\n\nJames Warner, an Imperial College London psychiatrist, added: “Depression causes misery to countless thousands every year and this study adds to the existing evidence that effective treatments are available.”']","This story also missed harms, evidence limitations, and a conflict of interest.","This Newsweek story covers an analysis of the best available trial data to attain a high-level assessment of 21 antidepressant medications.
The story gives good context about how prevalent depression is and how many people go without treatment of any kind, and reminds us that psychotherapy is also a viable treatment.
And yet the headline goes far beyond the scope of the study by claiming that “many more people” should take antidepressants. That assertion isn’t supported by anything in the story itself, and it’s a major misstep in our view, as treatment decisions should always be fully-informed, shared encounters between people and their physicians.
The story didn’t alert readers that most antidepressants were found to offer only a modest benefit, and side effects weren’t considered.
The story also missed study limitations and a conflict of interest for one of the people quoted.

""But the dose [given] is a lot more than conventionally given for any condition.""\n\nThe study was published Feb. 27 in the Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nIn the study, 40 Italian women were split into two groups: one receiving a single oral dose of 300,000 IUs of vitamin D3 and the other getting a placebo five days before the expected start of their menstrual periods.\n\nAfter two months, average pain scores dropped 41 percent for women assigned vitamin D treatment, while no difference in pain was reported in the placebo group.\n\nAlso, the women who took vitamin D reported no need to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as the pain reliever ibuprofen, to manage their pain in the two-month study period, while 40 percent of those assigned to placebo reported using an NSAID at least once.\n\nMenstrual cramps, known by the medical name dysmenorrhea, typically begin just before or at the start of a woman\'s menstrual period and can last several days. Experts attribute the pelvic pain to prostaglandins, a hormone-like substance that contributes to the contraction and relaxation of muscles and blood vessels.\n\nVitamin D3 apparently helped hamper prostaglandin production in study participants, easing their pain, said Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. The vitamin is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects, Rabin added.\n\n""The bottom line is, it looked like it worked,"" said Rabin, also head of urogynecology at the hospital. ""It was a very well-done study, but my comment is, it was one study. It asks more questions than it answers, which is the sign of a good trial.""\n\nThe 300,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 given in the study also far exceeds the daily intake of 600 IUs recommended for American women of reproductive age, both Graham and Rabin said. And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects.\n\nCurrently used methods of controlling menstrual cramps include NSAIDs and -- among those with severe pain -- birth control pills. But both have potential risks: NSAID users can experience stomach or kidney troubles, for example, while birth control pills are linked to blood clots in certain women. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies.\n\nVitamin D use has also been widely studied as a possible preventive for many other conditions, including heart disease, certain cancers and autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe Italian study participants all had blood levels of vitamin D measuring in the lowest 25 percent of normal at the study\'s outset, although the researchers didn\'t report the womens\' blood levels afterward. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study.\n\nGraham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.\n\n""From a symptomatic standpoint, it\'s something to be considered, but more studies are needed to see the risks and benefits,"" Graham said. ""Studies like this are starting to show that vitamin D is ubiquitous in receptors in our bodies . . . but it needs further explanation.""\n\nMore information\n\nTo find out more about painful menstrual periods, head to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","Overall, a serviceable story with a few flaws that could be easily addressed.","We wished for more on benefits, harms, and on context about the dose used in the study.   See our comments on those criteria below.

For the first time, doctors say, new therapies that include the drug allow them to envision a time when they might be able to keep melanoma patients alive for years, treating the tumor as they would a chronic disease. Q&A: Learn more about this promising new drug The pill, known as PLX4032, doesn\'t cure melanoma, and it helps only the roughly 50% of melanoma patients whose tumors have a mutation in a key gene called BRAF. But among those patients in the study, 81% saw their tumors shrink. And for those 32 patients, the drug kept melanoma in check for a median of seven months, says the study\'s lead author, Keith Flaherty of Massachusetts General Hospital. No other drug has ever helped that high a percentage of patients with melanoma or any other solid tumor, says Paul Chapman, co-author of the study in today\'s New England Journal of Medicine. The results are especially striking, he says, considering that only 10% to 20% of patients respond to standard treatments for melanoma, which don\'t improve overall survival. ""This is the most important breakthrough in melanoma, ever,"" says Lynn Schuchter of the University of Pennsylvania, who worked on the study. Some patients improved within days, she says. The most common side effects are fatigue, rash and joint pain, but some patients also developed non-lethal skin cancers, the study says. Until recently, patients have had few treatment options. The last new treatment for advanced melanoma was approved 12 years ago, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation. In June, however, researchers published results of another experimental drug, ipilimumab, the first to prolong overall survival for advanced melanoma patients in a large-scale trial. And researchers already are developing several other drugs similar to PLX4032, Turnham says, which could be key to preventing relapses. Although cancer often can mutate to get around one roadblock, the disease might have a harder time overcoming two, three or four different obstacles. One day, Flaherty says, doctors hope to routinely test patients\' tumors for their genetic makeup, then prescribe a drug combination to keep melanoma under control for years. For now, the new drug ""gives us something that we\'ve never had before, which is to reverse the disease for a period of time and give people a respite,"" he says.

In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects.\n\nTo Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D’s benefits is like a religion. “People want to have a simple story they can believe in,” he says.\n\nCedric Garland, meanwhile, hews just as strongly to the opposite view — that vitamin D supplements confer a slew of benefits, including warding off colon cancer, breast cancer, even Type 1 diabetes.\n\n“The science is, in my opinion, unassailable,” says Garland, an adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of California at San Diego. “It’s just preposterous to say it’s not proven.”\n\nIn January 2014, Autier published a statistical analysis of results from hundreds of studies of vitamin D. He concluded: “Unfortunately, there is probably no benefit to expect from vitamin D supplementation in normally healthy people.”\n\nGarland, on the other hand, is the co-author of dozens of studies showing a strong, inverse association between vitamin D levels and seemingly every disease under the sun. Indeed, sun exposure is Garland’s explanation for why rates of cancer, Type 1 diabetes and other diseases tend to be higher the farther people live from the equator. Vitamin D, after all, is the “sunshine vitamin,” synthesized from cholesterol in the skin in response to sunlight.\n\n“It’s a mathematical relationship,” he said in a telephone interview. “The higher your latitude and the greater your area’s average cloud cover, the higher your rates of cancer.” Since he and his late brother, Frank Garland, published the first study, in 1980, revealing that relationship, hundreds of other studies have explored the link between vitamin D, including supplements, and health — but none were large enough, long enough or designed well enough to convince the skeptics.\n\nNow three nationally recognized researchers are leading landmark studies designed to settle at least some of the questions about vitamin D once and for all. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public’s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves.\n\n“There’s been a rush to judgment on vitamin D,” says JoAnn E. Manson, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “Everyone has gotten on the bandwagon. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.”\n\nManson should know. She has led or collaborated on more than a dozen large, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, dating back more than two decades, which found none of the expected protection against cancer, heart disease, dementia or other diseases that scientists once attributed to beta carotene, vitamin E or vitamin C supplements. (She did find, however, that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 offered modest protection against age-related macular degeneration and, for those with a diet low in B vitamins to begin with, a hint of protection against the loss of cognitive abilities.)\n\nNow Manson is co-directing the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), testing whether, compared with placebo, a daily supplement of either 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D or one gram of fish oil (another widely touted substance) reduces the risk of stroke, cancer, heart disease and other health problems. The five-year study, involving 25,874 men and women, is scheduled to end in October 2017.\n\nAnother trial is testing whether a daily supplement of 4,000 IU of vitamin D will prevent Type 2 diabetes. The so-called D2d study, which will run for four years, is seeking to enroll 2,382 people older than 30 who are at high risk of developing diabetes due to weight or blood-sugar levels but who have not yet been diagnosed with the disease.\n\n“I would call myself an optimistic skeptic,” says Anastasios Pittas, principal investigator of the D2d study and a professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston. “The indirect evidence is very strong. People with higher levels of vitamin D in their blood have been shown again and again to have a lower risk of developing diabetes in the future. These studies are as consistent as we have ever seen with any nutrient.”\n\nBut, he adds, “those studies do not prove cause and effect. Before we make a blanket recommendation for the 86 million people in the United States who are at risk for Type 2 diabetes to go out and buy vitamin D supplements, we need to know for sure if they help.”\n\nA third trial, designed to test whether 5,000 IU of vitamin D per day will slow the progression of multiple sclerosis in 172 patients, is being led by Ellen Mowry, an associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n“I do discuss vitamin D with my patients,” Mowry says. “But I point out that we don’t yet have randomized, controlled-trials data to back it up. That’s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations. We have to be sure.”\n\nSo what are people to do in the meantime? Four years ago, Manson sat on a committee established by the Institute of Medicine to review how much vitamin D and calcium Americans need each day to maintain health and prevent disease. The report concluded that both are necessary for bone health but that as for preventing cancer, heart disease, diabetes and autoiummune disorders, the evidence was “inconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements.” Even so, the committee recommended that children and adults up to age 70 get 600 IU of vitamin D daily — from food and, if necessary, supplements — and that adults age 71 and older get 800 IU.\n\nSome studies have found no ill effects from taking far higher amounts, and many of the prospective but not proven benefits against cancer and other diseases are believed to require doses ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 IU. Manson urges people to rely on the Institute of Medicine report, which set a safe upper limit of 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day.\n\n“It’s fine to take that amount,” Manson said. “But keep in mind, there isn’t yet evidence that taking those higher amounts will confer any benefits beyond the recommended daily allotment of 600 to 800 IU.”\n\nSome studies, she noted, have even found evidence that very high levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood might be just as unhealthful as very low levels. A 2014 study, for instance, found that people with the highest levels of vitamin D in their blood (more than 60 nanograms per milliliter) were significantly more likely to die in the three months following a hospitalization as were people whose levels were between 30 and 49.9 ng/mL. Such findings are why she, Mowry and Pittas strongly advise people against taking more than the currently recommended upper daily limit of 4,000 IU, even though doses as high as 10,000 IU are available online and at many stores.\n\nFrustrated by the uncertainty? Pittas takes it in stride.\n\n“This is the beauty of medical research,” he says, “where you have some people convinced that vitamin D does nothing and others who believe it’s already proved to work. There is such controversy now that the only way to convince people who sit on those sides of the equation is to complete rigorous, randomized trials. We’ll see what happens. I have a hypothesis that vitamin D will work, but we have to test it. At the end of the studies, one of us will be right. I just don’t know which one.”\n\nHurley is a science journalist and author of “Natural Causes: Death, Lies and Politics in America’s Vitamin and Herbal Supplement Industry” (Broadway Books, 2007).']",A nice deep dive into existing research on vitamin D and the questions that some large new trials on the supplement are expected to resolve.,"This story examines the history of controversy over whether vitamin D has any preventive role in a laundry list of conditions including diabetes, depression and multiple sclerosis. There’s no controversy over its role in bone health. Different studies have reached different conclusions, and the story predicts that large randomized studies might help resolve these disputes a few years from now.
The coverage is exemplary in many ways. It delves deeply into the evidence on this topic and helps readers understand the strengths and limitations of existing studies. It features numerous expert perspectives from leaders in the field who provide a strong critical evaluation of the evidence. We were pleased to see the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) conclusions on vitamin D featured prominently. The IOM found that the evidence on vitamin D outside of bone health is “inconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements.”

1929,story_reviews_01485,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3029/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,Is a Colonoscopy More Effective in High-Def?,"['You\'ve seen high-definition televisions. Now some medical centers are marketing their high-definitioncolonoscopes, which they say will detect more pre-cancerous polyps. Several recent studies have found a small benefit to high-definition colonoscopy over the standard variety, but gastroenterologists say physician technique is more important in detecting polyps than equipment.\n\nColonoscopy, a screening test doctors recommend for most people starting at age 50, allows doctors to remove pre-cancerous growths before they become full-blown cancer. The test involves inserting a thin, flexible tube into the rectum: An image of the inside of the colon is sent to a video screen.\n\nWhile the test saves many lives, scientists say, it is far from perfect and polyps are often missed. ""There is a growing consensus that we need to improve the overall quality of colonoscopies and high-definition is one of the technologies that may help us do that,"" says Michael B. Wallace, chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla. Dr. Wallace receives research funding from Olympus Corp., a manufacturer of HD scopes.\n\nTim Foley\n\nMany hospitals now use high-definition colonoscopes, which are sold by a number of companies. The image is sharper and more detailed, and could potentially help clinicians find polyps they would have otherwise missed. The HD scope made by Japan\'s Olympus, for example, shows 1080 horizontal lines of data on the screen, compared with 400 to 500 horizontal lines shown by a standard-definition scope, says Frank Filiciotto, executive director of technical marketing at Olympus Corp. of the Americas.\n\nLawrence Cohen, associate clinical professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, says switching to high-definition machines recently increased the detection rate of pre- cancerous growths called adenomas in his four-physician New York private practice to 50%, compared with 42% when using a standard-definition machine. Most of the increase involves small growths, or those with a flat shape that are hard to see.\n\nClinical trial results have been mixed. An 850-person study by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic found that HD colonoscopy did not improve the identification of individuals with either benign polyps or adenomas. The study was published online last August in the journal Digestive Diseases and Sciences.\n\nA 2,430-patient study by researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, published earlier this year in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, found adenomas in 28.8% of patients examined with high-definition colonoscopy, compared with 24.3% in those examined with standard colonoscopy. Polyps were found in 42.2% versus 37.8%. The scope tested, from Olympus, had both high-definition and a wide-angle view.\n\nThe combination of wide-angle and HD ""does increase polyp detection by a small but significant amount,"" says Dr. Wallace, senior author of the study. Most of the additional growths found were very small, he adds, and it\'s not known how many of them would actually become cancer.\n\nEventually, Dr. Wallace says, improved detection with HD and other technologies may allow for less frequent colonoscopy screenings—and maybe even a once-in-a-lifetime screen for people who don\'t have a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors. Currently, colonoscopies must be repeated every 10 years, or more often if polyps are found.\n\nHD colonoscopy doesn\'t currently cost patients or insurers more than standard-definition scoping. Over the long run, the more expensive equipment adds only a few dollars to the cost of performing each procedure, says Douglas K. Rex, director of endoscopy at Indiana University Hospital in Indianapolis, but the additional polyps found may result in more biopsies, raising costs. A number of technologies on the horizon—including blue light that improves visualization of blood vessels in polyps, may allow gastroenterologists to determine if polyps are pre-cancerous without sending them to the lab, he adds. Dr. Rex tests equipment for Olympus and is a paid consultant to the company.\n\nWhen planning a colonoscopy, patients should seek a doctor with good technique. Going slowly during the exam, washing the colon frequently and looking behind folds of skin is more important than the type of scope used, Dr. Wallace says. Ask your doctor what his or her adenoma detection rate is; doctors should be finding at least one adenoma in 25% of male patients and 15% of female patients, Dr. Wallace says.\n\nAn alternative to colonoscopy is flexible sigmoidoscopy, a shorter, less expensive exam which looks only at the bottom portion of the colon, combined with a fecal occult blood test, which looks for blood in the stool. This is a ""reasonable strategy"" for colon-cancer screening, but needs to be repeated at least every five years instead of once a decade, Dr. Wallace says.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com.']","A solid story that could have strayed into ""gee whiz"" territory. Instead, the writer places this new entry in the colonscopy device market — high definition cameras — into the proper context.","More outside sources, hard analysis of the data, use of absolute (not relative) data and better specifics about costs could have made the story even better.

In part, this is due to the cancer’s ability to resist anti-androgen therapy. A University of Colorado Cancer Center study published today [May 3] in Oncotarget shows that combining a CPT1A inhibitors with anti-androgen therapy increases the cancer’s sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide.\n\n“This is a huge development for men with CRPC that previously did not have many options,” says Isabel Schlaepfer, PhD, CU Cancer Center member, assistant professor in the Division of Medical Oncology and senior author of the study. “There is a critical need for improved therapies for this specific cancer type.”\n\nMost cells use the energy of glucose (sugar). Some prostate cancers evolve to use energy from lipids (fat). Previous work shows that metabolizing lipids helps prostate cancer escape anti-androgen therapy. However, there are many steps involved in lipid metabolism and researchers have been working to break prostate cancer’s ability to harness this energy source. In this study the researchers focused on the CPT1A enzyme. CPT1A helps facilitate the entry of long chain fatty acids into the cell’s mitochondria for oxidation. This oxidation is vital to lipid metabolism and has been shown to aid cancer cell survival, resistance to radiation, oxidative stress, and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways.\n\n“We had to find a way to block this pathway so that the cancer would not be able to burn lipid in the mitochondria to acquire energy to resist therapy,” explains Schlaepfer.\n\nIn fact, we are already able to block the action of the CPT1A enzyme. The drug ranolazine is a fat oxidation inhibitor that earned FDA approval in 2006 to treat angina. When Schlaepfer and colleagues experimented with fat burning inhibitors and anti-androgens in cancer cell lines, they found that the addition of ranolazine to anti-androgen therapy made tumors more sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide.\n\n“This finding may have a huge impact on patients with CRPC that had very few options before,” says Schlaepfer. “Since the drugs are clinically safe, a clinical trial can be designed in patients for whom enzalutamide is prescribed.”']",This release would have been greatly improved with a caution that pre-clinical animal research often doesn’t pan out in people.,"This news release on a study of a drug’s potential to help inhibit tumor growth in certain types of metastatic prostate cancer never informed readers that the study was done in mice and not men.
Maybe the best way to summarize this release is by parsing what the headline does and does not say: “Breakthrough Study Stops Fat-Eating Prostate Cancer Cells” may be literally true but completely and utterly misleading, lacking both evidence or relevance to real humans who may be suffering from castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) whose poor prognosis is due to their cancer’s ability to resist anti-androgen hormone therapy.
The study itself examines the use of CPT1A inhibitors and anti-androgen therapy which could increase a cancer’s sensitivity to enzalutamide in mice. But we think readers are left without even the most basic evidence to support the release’s claim that the study is a “huge development for men with CRPC that previously did not have many options.”

In order to explore the widely held belief that practicing yoga can relieve mental stress, the team reviewed more than 100 studies on the effect of yoga and mental health.\n\n“Most individuals already know that yoga produces some kind of a calming effect. Individually, people feel better after doing the physical exercise,” says lead study author Dr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, a professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke University Medical Center. “Mentally, people feel calmer, sharper, maybe more content. We thought it’s time to see if we could pull all [the literature] together … to see if there’s enough evidence that the benefits individual people notice can be used to help people with mental illness.”\n\n(MORE: Yoga Can Help Stroke Survivors Regain Their Balance)\n\nTheir findings suggest that yoga does in fact have positive effects on mild depression and sleep problems, and it improves the symptoms of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and ADHD among patients using medication.\n\nThe researchers focused on 16 studies that recorded the effects of practicing yoga on mental-health issues ranging from depression, schizophrenia, ADHD, sleep complaints and eating disorders to cognitive problems. They found positive effects of the mind-and-body practice for all conditions with the exception of eating disorders and cognition. Those studies involved too few participants or produced conflicting results to draw any meaningful conclusions.\n\nSome of the studies included in the analysis even suggested that yoga might affect the body in ways similar to antidepressants and psychotherapy. For instance, yoga may influence brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters (boosting levels of feel-good agents like serotonin), lower inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and produce a healthier balance of lipids and growth factors — just as other forms of exercise do.\n\n(MORE: We Tried This: Aerial Vinyasa (or Upside-Down) Yoga)\n\nEmbracing yoga as a complementary treatment for mental disorders is not uncommon. Yoga is a feature in many veterans’ centers throughout the country, backed by research funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Huffington Post reported that many troops use yoga as a form of treatment for PTSD, for example, with companies like Warriors at Ease training instructors in yoga techniques specifically catered to those in the military. A study published earlier this month of 70 active-duty troops found daily yoga eased anxiety and improved sleep.\n\nThe researchers say there’s enough evidence to warrant a larger study on the effects of yoga on mental health, and it should be considered as part of treatment for more disorders. “Many millions of Americans are doing yoga and many millions of Americans have mental illnesses and are popping psychiatric pills daily. Despite all of this, the vast majority of studies looking at the benefits of yoga are all small studies. We did not come across a single study where there was a coordinated effort done by some large agency to really conduct a large national study,” says Doraiswamy.\n\n(MORE: Does Yoga Really Drive People Wild with Desire?)\n\nBut while the research is promising, yoga likely won’t be a panacea for mental illness. Nor should patients try to replace their medications with the practice. “What we are saying is that we still need to do further, large-scale studies before we are ready to conclude that people with mental illnesses can turn to yoga as a first-line treatment,” says Doraiswamy. “We are not saying throw away your Prozac and turn to yoga. We’re saying it has the promise and potential. If a large national study were done, it could turn out that yoga is just as good and may be a low cost alternative to people with unmet needs.” In the meantime, he says it doesn’t hurt to add yoga to existing treatments so patients can take advantage of any potential benefits.']","This was a superficial report that passed along the main findings of a study, but not much else.","This story reports on a review of studies which found that yoga has “positive effects on mild depression and sleep problems, and it improves the symptoms of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and ADHD among patients using medication.” Unfortunately, that’s about all the story had to say about the review. If you want to know how much improvement yoga can produce, or what symptoms are most affected, or what type of yoga works best, you’re out of luck. Ditto if you’re looking for information on costs and harms, or if you were hoping for an independent take on the findings.The story did clearly call out some limitations of the included studies, but we wish it had mentioned some other critical caveats.

But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.\n\n""The expectation in MS has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease. Now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability,"" said lead researcher Dr. Gavin Giovannoni. He is a neurology professor at Queen Mary University of London in England.\n\nThe treatment is not without its downsides, however. Because of the potential for side effects, people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, Giovannoni said.\n\nGiovannoni described Lemtrada as an immune system ""rebooter."" First, it depletes the immune system, then it allows it to recover, he explained.\n\nDuring the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said.\n\nAlso, when the immune system rebuilds itself, ""a significant number of people, about 40 percent, will develop another autoimmune disease,"" Giovannoni said. These include Graves\' disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which occurs in about 2 percent of patients, he noted.\n\n""But these diseases can be treated, so it\'s not like MS. It\'s kind of trading in your MS for another autoimmune disease,"" Giovannoni said.\n\nStill, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug.\n\nLemtrada is not for every patient with MS and the decision to use it should be carefully considered, said Dr. Dhanashri Miskin, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n""Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease,"" Miskin said.\n\nThe decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said. ""Although alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] treatment is associated with safety risks, those risks are manageable in most patients,"" Miskin said.\n\nThe new trial of more than 600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS was funded by Sanofi Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the drug\'s makers.\n\nMS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. People can suffer muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type, with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission.\n\nFor this study, Giovannoni and colleagues treated 628 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to at least one other MS drug. Lemtrada was given to 426 patients, while 202 received another drug, interferon beta-1a.\n\nThe researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years. By the study\'s end, nearly 28 percent of those given Lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a 10-point disability test, versus about 15 percent of those receiving interferon, the researchers found.\n\nMoreover, patients receiving Lemtrada were 2.5 times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon. And they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness, the findings showed.\n\nThe findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren\'t led by those recovering from relapses.\n\nGiovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from MS symptoms. Not only does alemtuzumab improve disability, but most patients go into long-term remission of at least five to eight years, he said.\n\n""Some patients have been going 12 years without any evidence of disease activity,"" he said.\n\nAccording to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, ""Restoring lost function is a significant unmet need for people living with MS.""\n\nThis study examines previous findings related to the reversal of some disability in those receiving alemtuzumab, he said. ""I am encouraged by these results and urge others to pursue potentially restorative approaches to treatment,"" Bebo said.\n\nGiovannoni pointed out that most of the drug\'s benefits are obtained early in the disease. ""If you really want this drug to have a big impact, you should use it as early as possible. In the European Union, it\'s recommended for early use,"" he noted.\n\nThe report was published online Oct. 12 in the journal Neurology.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about multiple sclerosis, visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.']",Readers need reminding that the manufacturer of a drug has an extremely strong interest in getting their drug used as early as possible in a disease process and that measures of “benefit” need to correspond to this early use.,"While most drugs are studied as a way to demonstrate benefit over other treatment, this trial of what could be described as a “last-ditch” drug–Lemtrada (alemtuzumab)–was studying optimal timing. Basically, is is better to give this drug more quickly, or only after trying other treatments?
This is a very important question and while this HealthDay story seems balanced, with numerous mentions of benefits and harms, there was a noted lack of a few key details, including the potential conflicts of interest among those who are pushing for quicker use of this treatment.

The new moms found that the conversations helped relieve symptoms.\n\n“Postpartum depression is a problem for one in seven women, and many of them don’t get help because there’s a stigma and they don’t have time and it’s expensive,” said study leader Dr. Nicole Letourneau, a professor and research chair in parent-infant mental health at the University of Calgary. “Training peer counselors to do phone counseling is an effective, low-cost and non-stigmatizing way for new moms to get the help they need.”\n\nParticularly for first-time mothers, postpartum depression can be hard to distinguish from the stress and fatigue that come with caring for a new infant around the clock, Letourneau said. Symptoms can include sadness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feelings of shame or guilt, as well as difficulty bonding with the baby or thoughts about harming the baby.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of phone counseling for easing these symptoms, Letourneau and colleagues identified 64 mothers with symptoms of major depression within 24 months after delivery and offered them up to 12 weekly peer support calls.\n\nThe average mom with depression was about 26 years old. Most had symptoms of depression before they got pregnant, and many had previously been treated with medication or professional counseling.\n\nThe women who volunteered as peer counselors attended an eight-hour training course and received reference materials about postpartum depression. They also had nurses available for phone consults if they had concerns about anything the moms said during their conversations.\n\nBy midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.\n\nOver the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. On average, they spoke about three times.\n\nMothers who left the study said they no longer needed support, sought counseling from mental health professionals, or didn’t have time for the phone calls.\n\nWhile all of the mothers were depressed at the start of the study, at mid-point only 32 percent were at risk for depression, and this declined to 15 percent at the end. Furthermore, at mid-point, 60 percent of the mothers had low depression scores; this percentage rose to 75 percent at end.\n\nEven though the small study had several women drop out and lacked a control group of moms who received different treatment, the results are consistent with previous research that has proven peer counseling works, said Dr. Ruta Nonacs, a psychiatrist at the Center for Women’s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\n“It is a very powerful experience to be able to talk to a woman who has gone through the same thing and come out the other side,” said Nonacs, who wasn’t involved in the study. “A lot of first-time moms wonder what’s normal, what’s depression, and what to do with the fact that they feel overwhelmed and alone and like their experience looks nothing like the happy moms they see smiling in all of the baby food and diaper commercials.”\n\nBecause postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbirth, it makes sense to explore peer counseling and other interventions that can reach women in rural or suburban areas where access to mental health professionals may be limited, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the Center for Women’s Mood Disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n“Most people in the world have access to a telephone,” said Meltzer-Brody, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1MPlxUu Journal of Advanced Nursing, online February 23, 2015.']",A generally complete report on a study of peer phone counseling for postpartum depression.,"This story reports on a small study suggesting that peer counseling by telephone can be helpful for some mothers experiencing postpartum depression. The story is thoroughly reported. It includes perspectives from two experts not affiliated with the research, and a good explanation of the study’s limitations. But there are a few areas where some extra details would have made the story stronger. For example, the story falls short in describing costs and potential harms of the intervention. We’d also add that in any study with no control group, it’s important to evaluate all aspects of the study that might explain the positive results. Did the women have any contact — for example, with other doctors or health professionals — that might have led to a reduction in symptoms? The story also could have done more to explain what happens to women with postpartum depression who aren’t treated. Would most of them get better with time? The study may not prove much if the women would be expected to get better on their own.

Seaman\n\n(Reuters Health) - Women who take part in exercise, diet programs or a combination of the two during pregnancy can prevent excessive weight gain, according to a fresh review of past research.\n\nThe review incorporates dozens of new studies to update a previous review that did not find enough evidence to support the use of diet and exercise during pregnancy.\n\nAfter including the new studies, the new review found “high-quality evidence” to show diet, exercise or both can reduce the risk of excessive weight gain during pregnancy, write the researchers in The Cochrane Library.\n\nOther benefits may include a lower risk of cesarean delivery, excessive birth weight, and respiratory\n\nproblems in the newborn, “particularly for high-risk women receiving combined diet and exercise interventions,” add the researchers, led by Benja Muktabhant of Khon Kaen University in Thailand.\n\nThe U.S. Institute of Medicine says the amount of weight women should gain during pregnancy varies depending on their non-pregnancy weight.\n\nFor example, a normal-weight woman should gain between 25 and 35 pounds, while an overweight woman should gain between 15 and 25 pounds. Obese women should gain even less.\n\nGaining too much weight is tied to an increased risk of complications for both mother and child, according to the researchers, who completed the review for The Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research.\n\nFor the new review, the researchers examined data from 65 randomized controlled trials, which are considered the “gold standard” of medical research. They were able to combine data from 49 trials involving a total of 11,444 pregnant women.\n\nThe women were randomly assigned to a diet, exercise, a combination of the two or standard care. The diets and exercise programs varied, but could include low-glycemic diets and unsupervised exercise.\n\nWomen who took part in diet, exercise or combination programs were about 20 percent less likely than women in standard-care groups to gain too much weight while pregnant, the researchers report.\n\nThe women who took part in diet, exercise and combination programs were also less likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy, compared to those in the standard care group.\n\nThere was no clear benefit among the women in the diet and exercise groups when the researchers looked at other complications, such as cesarean delivery, but it did look like there may be some benefit, they write.\n\nWhile the new study generally did not show fewer complications in the diet and exercise group, Dr. Loralei Thornburg told Reuters Health that it’s good that there was no increase in complications.\n\n“This was very reassuring that there wasn’t an increased risk of preterm birth with moderate exercise,” said Thornburg, a high-risk pregnancy expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\n\n“Most people gain more weight than they probably should during pregnancy,” Thornburg, who was not involved with the review, told Reuters Health.\n\nShe said women who gain too much weight may not be able to lose it after the baby is born. Then, during the next pregnancy the woman is already heavier and that may increase the risk of complications.\n\n“In the next pregnancy, if you don’t get it off, you may go from obese to very obese,” Thornburg said.\n\nShe cautioned, however, that women should check with their doctors before starting a diet and exercise program during pregnancy.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1C3lYDc The Cochrane Library, online June 11, 2015.']","This story had a solid foundation, but lacked a few important details that would have made the coverage more thorough and informative.","The story recaps a recent paper that reviewed the medical literature on the effect of exercise and diet programs on pregnant women. The story reports that women who took part in exercise, diet programs, or both, were less likely to gain too much weight during pregnancy. And it does a good job of defining the guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy for women of different body weights. However, the story could have quantified the potential benefits of diet and exercise programs in a more precise and meaningful way. In addition, it suggests that such programs reduce the risk of other health-related outcomes without clarifying the variability of evidence to support those claims (many results for these benefits were not statistically significant). The story also didn’t note that diet and exercise programs increased the risk of low pregnancy weight gain, which, like excessive weight gain, is associated with a variety of adverse health effects.

This technology is a way to directly measure how much fluid is in a patient, allowing us to intervene before they develop symptoms of congestion, before they end up in hospital. This is a big game-changer.”\n\nFunded by the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, the device called CardioMEMS™ HF System was successfully implanted by interventional cardiologists at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in March 2017. The system features a small butterfly-like sensor that then sits inside the pulmonary artery of a heart failure patient. When the patient lies on an accompanying antenna-equipped pillow device, the sensor provides important data – including the patient’s lung pressure readings to clinicians – via a secure website.\n\n“Never before have we had the ability to obtain a patient’s accurate lung pressure data while they are outside the hospital,” said Meredith Linghorne, nurse practitioner, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. “Traditionally we’ve relied on a patient describing symptoms, and by then they may have already progressed to the point of hospitalization. With this device, we can see warning signs days in advance, and adjust treatment accordingly.”\n\nThe most rapidly rising cardiovascular disease in Canada, heart failure affects close to one million Canadians, and an estimated 26 million people globally. In Canada, heart failure patients stay an average of almost 10 days for each hospital admission, accounting for 1.4 million hospital stays a year. These patients live an average of 2.1 years after diagnosis and cost the Canadian health-care system more than $3 billion annually. About one-quarter of these patients return to hospital within three months, while approximately 50 per cent return to hospital within six months.\n\nThe CardioMEMS™ HF System is designed to monitor heart failure patients whose condition is serious but who are not so ill that the technology cannot improve their outcome. The first Canadian patient implanted with the heart monitor will be among 25 patients within the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre to be fitted with the device over the next nine months.\n\nProduced by Abbott, the CardioMEMSÔ HF System is approved in the United States by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and is currently awaiting approval by Health Canada.\n\n- 30 -\n\nVideo interview: Dr. Heather Ross, cardiologist, and Meredith Linghorne, nurse practitioner.\n\nABOUT THE TED ROGERS CENTRE FOR HEART RESEARCH\n\nThe Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research aims to develop new diagnoses, treatments and tools to prevent and individually manage heart failure – Canada’s fastest growing cardiac disease. Enabled by an unprecedented gift of $130 million from the Rogers family, the Centre was jointly conceived by its three partner organizations: the Hospital for Sick Children, University Health Network, and the University of Toronto. Together, they committed an additional $139 million toward the Centre – representing a $270 million investment in basic science, translational and clinical research, innovation, and education in regenerative medicine, genomics, and the clinical care of children and adults. It is addressing heart failure across the lifespan. www.tedrogersresearch.ca / @trogersresearch\n\nABOUT THE PETER MUNK CARDIAC CENTRE\n\nThe Peter Munk Cardiac Centre is the premier cardiac centre in Canada. Since it opened in 1997, the Centre has saved and improved the lives of cardiac and vascular patients from around the world. Each year, approximately 55,000 patients receive innovative and compassionate care from multidisciplinary teams in the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, and the Centre trains more cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons and vascular surgeons than any other hospital in Canada. The Centre is based at the Toronto General Hospital and the Toronto Western Hospital - members of University Health Network. www.petermunkcardiaccentre.ca']",An anecdote doesn’t constitute good scientific evidence. Where are the data?,"This news release covers the first implantation of a device called CardioMEMS in a Canadian heart failure patient. The wireless device includes a butterfly-like sensor, which sits inside the patient’s pulmonary artery and sends pressure readings to a secure website.
No other context or data are given. Although CardioMEMS is “novel” in Canada, the US has implanted the device in patients since 2007, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for market in 2014.
We would have liked to have seen some outcome data from the CHAMPION trial, which followed 550 heart failure patients for around 15 months to see whether patients with CardioMEMS devices would require fewer heart failure-related hospitalizations. Instead, we are told that this one Canadian patient’s implantation procedure in March was “successful,” without any further information on how the patient is doing now and may do in the future.
Finally, the news release uses terms like “big game-changer” for the device and refers to heart failure as an “epidemic.” In these types of announcements, we like to see more neutral and cautious wording for medical stories, especially since the news release doesn’t mention the costs and harms associated with this device.

Marketers of genetic tests claim the answer is in mail-order kits costing less than $200.\n\nSome customers say the test results help them steer their children to appropriate sports. But skeptical doctors and ethicists say the tests are putting profit before science and have a much greater price tag — potentially robbing perfectly capable youngsters of a chance to enjoy activities of their choice.\n\n""In the `winning is everything\' sports culture, societal pressure to use these tests in children may increasingly present a challenge to unsuspecting physicians,"" according to a commentary in Wednesday\'s Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nScientists have identified several genes that may play a role in determining strength, speed and other aspects of athletic performance. But there are likely hundreds more, plus many other traits and experiences that help determine athletic ability, said Dr. Alison Brooks, a pediatrician and sports medicine specialist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.\n\nBrooks and University of Michigan physician Dr. Beth Tarini wrote the commentary to raise awareness about the issue.\n\nA handful of companies are selling these tests online. In some cases, the tests screen for genes that are common even among non-athletes. As science advances, Brooks said, ""My guess is we\'re going to see more of this, not less.""\n\nBradley Marston of Bountiful, Utah, bought a test online a year ago for his daughter Elizabeth, then 9.\n\nShe\'s ""a very talented soccer player,"" and Marston wanted to know if she had a variation of a gene called ACTN3, which influences production of a protein involved in certain muscle activity.\n\nOne form of the gene has been linked with explosive bursts of strength needed for activities such as sprinting and weight lifting.\n\nThe ACTN3 test sold by Atlas Sports Genetics was developed by Genetic Technologies Limited, an Australian firm. Atlas\' $169 kit consists of two swabs to scrape cells from the inside of the cheek. Customers return the used swabs to the Boulder, Colo., company and receive an analysis several days later.\n\nElizabeth Marston\'s test showed she has a sprinting-related gene form — results her father hopes will help her get into elite sports programs or win a sports scholarship to college.\n\nMarston said he ordered the test partly out of curiosity, but approached it cautiously and talked with Elizabeth to make sure she could handle it.\n\n""She told me, `Well, Daddy, I just have to try harder\'"" if the results came back negative, Marston said.\n\nElizabeth has loved soccer since age 4 and said she\'s happy with the results.\n\nBut even at age 10, she knows it will take more than genes to reach her goal of playing in the Olympics.\n\n""I think I would have to train hard,"" she said.\n\nNat Carruthers, operations president for Atlas Sports Genetics, says the company has sold several hundred test kits since it began marketing them in 2008.\n\n""Our goal is to help people become the athlete they were born to be,"" not to exclude kids from certain sports, Carruthers said.\n\nHe said critics have misrepresented the test ""to sound like we\'re telling parents what their kid should do and how good their kid will be. That\'s not at all our claim or desire,"" he said.\n\nCyGene Laboratories, based in Coral Springs, Fla., sold a similar $100 swab test online for different sports-related genes until last fall, but it has suspended operations.\n\nCyGene also sold kits online advertised as testing for human diseases, but Mark Munzer, the company\'s former president, said that industry is reeling from a Food and Drug Administration crackdown last year on efforts to sell disease-related gene tests in retail pharmacies.\n\nThe FDA scheduled a hearing on Tuesday to receive feedback from an expert panel on how the agency should be regulating direct-to-consumer genetic tests that make medical claims. Marketers of sports gene tests that don\'t make medical claims aren\'t FDA regulated.\n\nUniversity of Maryland researcher Stephen Roth, a specialist in exercise physiology and genetics who has studied the ACTN3 gene, said the science of how genes influence athletic ability ""is in its infancy"" and that marketers\' claims are based on ""gross assumptions.""\n\nRoth said roughly 80 percent of people worldwide have the ACTN3 gene that has been linked with explosive force. The fact that few of them become elite athletes underscores that it takes more than genes to make a sports star.\n\nAlso, about 20 percent of people have a gene variation that inhibits production of the protein involved in explosive force. That doesn\'t mean they can\'t excel in sports, Roth said, citing a Spanish long jumper who made it to the Olympics despite lacking that protein.\n\nDr. Lainie Friedman Ross, a medical ethicist and pediatrician at the University of Chicago, said the tests raise ethical questions when used in children because they\'re too young to understand the possible ramifications and to give adequate consent.\n\n""This is recreational genetics with a real serious potential for harm,"" Ross said. ""People are going to think, `If my kid has this, I\'m going to have to push real hard. If my kid doesn\'t have it, I\'m going to give up before I start,"" she said. Instead, Ross said, parents should ""let kids follow their dreams.""\n\n""While parents have the authority to make health care decisions about their children, this type of genetic testing is elective at best and should actively involve the children in the decision-making process,"" Ross said.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nJAMA: http://jama.ama-assn.org']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">Nice job summarizing the potential ethical and psychological impact of home gene testing kits and provides an appropriately cautious tone regarding the evidence surrounding a particular gene and its association with athleticism.  </span></span>"," A recent commentary published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) calls attention to the potential harms associated with testing children for genes associated with sports performance. 
What differentiates the results reported in this study of genes associated with athletic performance from other association studies appears to be the lack of strong evidence supporting this association with athletic performance. This means that unlike certain genes that really have been associated with, say heart disease, at the level of a population, the jury is still out on the evidence for genes associated with athletic performance. So if we’re not sure at the population level, it means that this test is of no practical value for any individual (or as this article mentions – the hopeful parent of an indifferent child) who wishes to predict the future likelihood of being a professional athlete.

Two studies will be published back-to-back in the December issue of Journal of Nuclear Medicine--one as featured article of the month--describing testing of three candidate molecules in patients with Alzheimer\'s disease, as well as the use of one molecule to measure the accumulation of tau proteins.\n\n""One of the greatest public health challenges is Alzheimer\'s disease, for which there currently is no cure and no definitive diagnostic until autopsy,"" says Dean Wong, M.D., Ph.D., professor of radiology and radiological sciences, psychiatry and behavioral sciences, neurology and neuroscience, and director of the Section of High Resolution Brain PET Imaging, Division of Nuclear Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""We have been working hard to identify new radiopharmaceuticals that can help speed the discoveries of diagnostics and treatments for these devastating neurodegenerative disorders.""\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is characterized in the brain by the appearance of two abnormal protein structures: amyloid plaques and tangled fibers made up of a protein called tau. One of the biggest challenges in studying Alzheimer\'s disease thus far, according to Wong, is the inability to watch these so-called neurofibrillary tangles develop in real time.\n\nAs part of a longer term project funded by F. Hoffman-La Roche, the team previously tested a collection of approximately 550 potential tracer molecules and identified six promising tracers, eventually narrowing them down to three to be made and tested as candidate Tau PET radiopharmaceuticals. These three most promising tracers were previously tested in nonhuman primates, and the results looked promising enough to test in people.\n\nThe researchers recruited a total of 12 patients with Alzheimer\'s disease, seven younger healthy controls (ages 25-38 years old) and five older healthy controls (age 50 or older) for brain-only PET scans. An additional six older healthy controls were recruited for full-body scanning. The study was divided into three parts. In the first part, each person was injected with two of the three randomly designated tracers (on separate visits) prior to receiving a brain PET scan with subsequent evaluation to determine which molecule performed best. In the second part of the study, researchers tested the optimal tracer, called F-18 RO948, with additional brain imaging in five patients with Alzheimer\'s and five older controls, with follow-up of previously seen patients to evaluate the potential progression of tau protein tangling after an average span of approximately 16 months.\n\nThe third part of the study examined six older controls undergoing whole-body scanning. In total, the researchers looked at 80 different regions in the brain to evaluate how well the tracers were taken up by the brain, how well they penetrated through the tissue and how specifically they bound to the tau protein rather than just sticking indiscriminately to anything. Regions of the brain that typically contain accumulated tau protein include the temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital lobe, among others; grey matter in the cerebellum is thought to contain low or no tau in patients with Alzheimer\'s. They found that healthy brains retained little to no tracer, whereas the brains of those with Alzheimer\'s showed tau to be in regions of the brain consistent with previously reported postmortem data on filamentous tangles.\n\nIn the second paper, the team examined the detailed quantification of tau binding via F-18 RO948 in 11 patients with Alzheimer\'s disease, five young cognitively normal controls and five older cognitively normal controls. They verified that detailed quantification of the tested and retested tracer in those five patients with Alzheimer\'s and five older controls generated good and reproducible results. According to Wong, this body of work reveals that, as compared with the currently used Tau tracer, F-18 AV1451, the new tracer, F-18 RO948, does not bind randomly to other tissue, offering greater clarity into quantification of potential tau burden within the human brain.\n\n""It really takes a village to make progress in biomedical research, and this project was no exception, with the involvement of the PET team at Hopkins, a CRO who helped recruit healthy subjects, colleagues in psychiatry and behavioral sciences, colleagues at the National Institute of Aging and neuroscience imaging experts at Roche,"" says Wong. ""This is a true example of cross-disciplinary collaboration, and I\'m honored to have such great collaborators.""\n\n###\n\nThis study was made available online in May 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication. It was published in the December 2018 issue of the journal.\n\nAuthors of the first Journal of Nuclear Medicine featured paper ""Characterization of 3 Novel Tau Radiopharmaceuticals, 11C-RO-963, 11C-RO-643, and 18F-RO-948, in Healthy Controls and in Alzheimer Subjects"" include Dean F.

The papers were published in the December issue of the Journal of Nuclear Medicine.
Specifically, the papers evaluated “tracer” molecules that might be useful for identifying “tau tangles” — proteins in the brain that occur in patients with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.
The release does a good job of describing the research, but does not address costs, potential harms, or the potential accuracy of diagnostic tests that might be developed based on these tracer molecules. Also, we think the headline jumps the gun in calling this a “promising diagnostic tool.”

Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow.\n\nWhen a person suffers a heart attack, he or she is often left with huge areas of scarring in the heart. Scarred heart muscle doesn\'t pump blood as well as it used to, putting stress on other parts of the heart to make up for the deficit. The damaged area also doesn\'t conduct electric current as well, leading to an abnormal heart rhythm, which can cause more problems. Heart attack patients often go on to develop heart failure.\n\n\n\n""This is the first instance of therapeutic regeneration,"" says Dr. Eduardo Marbán, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute.\n\nHe says while nature abounds with examples of spontaneous regeneration of limbs or tissues - like a salamander\'s new tail or a human liver regrowing to full size if partially damaged - doctors have not been able to help patients regrow heart tissue. This could change in the future if larger clinical trials and longer patient outcomes confirm the results of this early research published Monday in the journal The Lancet.\n\nMarbán and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November.\n\nTo qualify for this clinical trial, patients had to have suffered a recent heart attack and ""had to have a significant amount of damage to begin with and weren\'t squeezing [blood into the body] as well as they should have,"" says Dr. Peter Johnston, one of the study authors who injected the new heart cells into patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nA total of 25 patients participated in the clinical trial, which was designed to determine if it was safe to have cells grown from one\'s own heart tissue injected back into the heart. Seventeen patients received the stem cell transplants, while the other eight patients were given conventional post-heart attack therapy.\n\nIn an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, doctors funneled a catheter into the patient\'s heart and removed peppercorn-sized bits of tissue from the part of the patient\'s heart that was unaffected by the heart attack. Using a procedure invented by Marbán, heart stem cells were isolated from the tissue and then millions of new cells were grown in a petri dish.\n\nAbout four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts.\n\nMarbán says when the first patient data came in, he and his colleagues were relieved to see the procedure was safe. After 12 months, researchers report only one patient appeared to have a serious side effect that may have been connected to the experimental cells.\n\nSix months after the first patient was injected with his cells grown from his own heart tissue, Marbán says there was dramatic shrinking of scar tissue and new tissue had grown. ""That was unprecedented"" he says. ""No one had demonstrated that before.""\n\nAll patients were followed for six months and researchers have 12-month data for 21 patients. In patients who received the cell transplant, Marbán says about half of their scar tissue dissolved and the reduction in scar size appears to get bigger after the first six months. He says that why this is happening is still unclear.\n\nMarbán says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. [On average] ""22 grams (about .78 ounces) of new heart tissue grew,"" which he says is quite remarkable considering this had never been done before and the average weight of the part of the heart that is responsible for pumping the blood through the body is about 150 grams (about 5.3 ounces).\n\nPatients in the control group, those who didn\'t get a cell transplant, did not regenerate any tissue and the amount of scar tissue they had remained the same.\n\nSonia Skarlatos, Ph.D and deputy director of the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says this early research is very exciting and a move in the right direction. She cautions that this procedure has to be tested on many more patients and they have to be observed for longer periods than in the current study, but she says these results are all very positive. She is hopeful further studies will confirm these early results.\n\n""By preventing the consequences of a heart attack you may be able to prevent further down the heart failure that happens in [many of these] patients."" Skarlatos says.\n\nShe was not involved in the research but the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute did help fund it.\n\nSkarlatos also says it\'s still not clear exactly what is making the heart regenerate and scar tissue disappear.

But they jibe with previous studies suggesting that getting cholesterol levels under control might help reduce the risk of life-threatening disease, researchers said.\n\n“People may be on these medications for their heart, but it may actually be doing them some good for their prostate,” said study author Dr. Stephen Marcella, from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in New Brunswick.\n\n“If a person’s on the fence about taking a statin medication for their heart, this is another potential benefit they may have by taking one of these,” he told Reuters Health.\n\nMarcella and his colleagues collected the medical records of 380 men who had died of prostate cancer and another 380 of the same age and race without prostate cancer or with non-lethal cancer.\n\nMost of the men were white and in their mid- to late-60s, on average. Close to one in four of the men in both groups combined had ever taken a statin.\n\nThe researchers found that men who died of prostate cancer were half as likely to have taken a statin at any time, and for any duration, than men in the “control” group.\n\nWhen they accounted for whether or not men were overweight and their other health problems and medications, it turned out that those with fatal cancers were 63 percent less likely to have ever taken a statin, according to findings published in Cancer.\n\nBut, Marcella added, “I would not tell a person if they don’t have a risk of heart disease, (if) they don’t have hypertension...to take a statin just to prevent lethal prostate cancer.”\n\nThe evidence that’s effective, he said, just isn’t there yet.\n\nAnd even if statins do turn out to help prevent fatal prostate cancer, researchers said, previous studies have suggested they don’t lower a man’s risk of getting less aggressive forms of the disease.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, about one in every six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point, and one in every 36 men will die of the disease.\n\nMarcella’s team didn’t have the data to figure out if taking a statin for longer, or starting one earlier, was more beneficial than more limited use of the drugs.\n\n‘VERY TRICKY TO SORT OUT’\n\nThe researchers also couldn’t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer.\n\nBut they did find that while high-potency, often newer statins were linked to a lower risk of fatal prostate cancer, lower-potency drugs were not. That suggests it’s something about the drugs themselves that lower men’s chances of dying from prostate cancer, Marcella said.\n\nStatins may protect against fatal prostate cancer through their known cholesterol-lowering effects, said Dr. Stephen Freedland, who studies prostate cancer at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, but wasn’t involved in the new study.\n\nHe said that cholesterol is a “key nutrient” for cancer cells, so lower cholesterol levels in the body could prevent more aggressive forms of cancer from developing.\n\nBut it’s also possible that statins don’t prevent certain cancers at all, Freedland said, and it’s something else about men who take statins — for example, if they also change their diet and start exercising — that explains their lower risk of fatal cancer.\n\n“It gets very, very tricky to sort out,” Freedland told Reuters Health.\n\nTo prove that statins protect against aggressive cancer would require a large study in which cancer-free men, or those with early-stage disease, are randomly assigned to take statins or not and then tracked for years to see how many of them die from cancer.\n\nThat type of study, especially involving healthy, disease-free men, would be very expensive and time consuming, said Dr. Nelly Tan, from the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied statins and prostate cancer risk.\n\nAbout one-quarter of adults age 45 and older in the U.S. take statins to lower cholesterol and protect against heart attacks. The drugs run anywhere from $11 to more than $200 per month, and sometimes cause side effects including muscle pain, nausea and gas and liver dysfunction.\n\nResearchers agreed that until there’s clearer evidence for benefit, men with healthy hearts shouldn’t seek out statin prescriptions for the purpose of lowering their prostate cancer risks.\n\nBut Freedland said that other strategies for lowering cholesterol — such as eating better and exercising regularly — are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/v7AokK Cancer, online December 16, 2011.']",Touch ’em all.  This story neatly addressed all 10 of our criteria.,"It really isn’t that difficult to address our criteria, as this story demonstrates.

Women in menopause or those who cannot take estrogen, including our breast cancer survivors, often suffer in silence when their vagina decides to completely dry up and lose its moist and supple lining, causing disruptive symptoms. It can affect your ability to do everyday activities such as exercise and engage in sexual contact and intercourse due to pain and discomfort.\n\nSymptoms of VVA include dryness, burning, irritation, itching, urinary incontinence and urinary frequency. These symptoms are mainly caused by a condition called vaginal atrophy, which is due to menopause or peri-menopause or occurs after child birth.\n\nWomen with VVA report the following:\n\n75 percent of women report vaginal atrophy negatively impacts their lives.\n\n63 percent failed to recognize vaginal atrophy as a chronic condition.\n\n44 percent report they did not consult a gynecologist for finding a solution.\n\n4 percent only recognized the common symptoms of vaginal atrophy.\n\nEstrogen is the best treatment option for VVA since it rehydrates the vagina and restores lubrication and pH balance in the vagina. Unfortunately, this is not always an appropriate option, especially if you have breast cancer or are unable or unwilling to be on estrogen. Other medication options include Osphena, vaginal estrogen, steroid and testosterone creams, and lubrications or moisturizers.\n\nThe Mona Lisa Touch Laser Treatment, or MLLT, is one of the newest kids on the block to combat vaginal atrophy. There are other types of vaginal lasers, but they don't have the same track record, Food and Drug Administration support and long-term studies as the MLLT. An Italian-built laser device, the Mona Lisa Touch Laser holds tremendous promise in treating a vagina that has been transformed in menopause or via cancer treatment side effects.\n\nOnce you've had a pelvic exam to assure you're an appropriate candidate, a physician trained in the use of the Mona Lisa – which is actually a small vaginal laser – inserts the device into the vagina during three 4-minute sessions, six weeks apart. Many women report positive changes after just the first 4-minute treatment, which involves removing the dried skin inside that vagina, stimulating collagen and blood flow production, and allowing vaginal revival. The end result is a vagina makeover – a new lease on a vagina, if you will – with more elasticity and natural lubrication of the tissue inside the vagina. Although it may sound too good to be true, the results are proving to be a game changer in the way vagina atrophy is being treated – without hormones – which is a relief to many women and their partners.\n\nMona Lisa is ideal for women who can't take estrogen due to a personal or family history of breast cancer or for those who are unhappy with the side effects associated with hormone replacement therapy. Still, there is a painful part of the procedure: the cost. It runs about $1,000 a session and is most likely not covered by insurance.""]","Without any discussion of evidence, this story makes big claims that border on disease-mongering.","This mostly data-free story is by a self-described (on her website) OB-GYN and lifestyle “entrepreneur,” and reads much like a promotional piece for one brand of a growing number of laser-based devices used to treat vulvo-vaginal atrophy.
By some estimates, a majority of women experience vulvo-vaginal atrophy during and after menopause, childbirth, or cancer treatment, and for many, the symptoms can include burning, itching, irritation and pain during sexual intercourse. A host of of medicinal therapies, including the gold standard of low-dose local  estrogen, hormone creams, and topical lubricants are available.
Although the article notes the availability of other laser-based device and medicinal options, it makes unsupported claims for the superiority of the Mona Lisa Touch Laser (MLTL), stating “there has not been a successful non-medication alternative treatment option for vaginal dryness.” The rationale offered for such praise is that the other vaginal lasers “don’t have the same track record,” but in fact all of the devices marketed in the U.S. have U.S. Food and Drug approval.
The overall issue for women who want to treat vaginal dryness is that the bar is set very low for FDA approval of devices (in contrast to studies needed to approved medicines), and although the article touts the MLTL as having undergone “long term studies,” the literature suggests that the longest follow up in studies of it and its shelf mates is closer to 12 weeks.
Overall, the device highlighted here has been tested in only a few studies involving a few hundred women worldwide, and long-term effects of using this or any laser to essentially “remodel” the vagina by removing layers of built-up dry skin are unknown.

The findings were presented Dec. 6 at the 57th annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Orlando, Florida.\n\nPatients with cancers of the immune system, like multiple myeloma, are especially susceptible to common infections, and a bout of the flu can lead to serious illness and even death. Even though patients with multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders may receive an annual flu vaccine, studies show that a one-time flu shot does not offer adequate immune response.\n\nThe Yale researchers developed a strategy that entailed offering patients a high-dose flu vaccine followed by a second high-dose booster shot one month later. The high-dose vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose) was approved in 2009 by the FDA as a single dose for adults over 65.\n\nThe booster strategy lowered the flu infection rate among patients to 6% versus an expected rate of 20%, and it improved protection against all flu strains covered by the vaccine in 66% of patients, said the study\'s first author Andrew Branagan, M.D., a postdoctoral associate in medicine (hematology).\n\n""Using an approved flu vaccine in a novel dosing schedule yielded promising results for a group patients at high risk for infection,"" Branagan said. ""We hope to confirm these results in a larger prospective randomized trial that is underway now at Yale during the 2015-2016 flu season.

The weather was rotten, an earlier appointment ran long — and 15-year-old Jordan was the picture of health.\n\nToday, the Cincinnati mother of two is thankful she didn\'t. Doctors diagnosed Jordan with aortic root dilation, a potentially life-threatening heart defect. They advised the teen — who played six sports, his favorite being baseball — to quit competitive athletics for good.\n\nFor decades pediatricians and family physicians have sought a more effective way to identify young athletes at risk of dying while playing the sports they love.\n\nNow, the Heart Institute at Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital Medical Center is testing a new method. In the most complete test of its kind, the institute is using both an electrocardiogram and limited echocardiogram to see the rhythm and structure of the heart.\n\nIf proved effective, it could become the norm for identifying heart conditions that put one in 10,000 people at risk when doing top-level physical activities, researchers say.\n\nSince the study began about a year ago, 500 local teens have been screened and 26 diagnosed with heart abnormalities. Twenty-two can continue in athletics, though they\'ll require lifelong monitoring.\n\nFour young athletes, two girls and two boys, have been advised to quit sports altogether. Researchers hope to screen a total of 640 before they\'re done.\n\nSo far, their work is turning up a higher rate of heart abnormalities than expected.\n\nJordan was one of the more serious cases.\n\nThat day at his appointment, he, his mother and little sister Jaelynne sat astonished as doctors described a dangerously large root in Jordan\'s heart. Because of its size, it could rupture if stressed by too much physical activity. The effects could kill him.\n\nJordan took his doctor\'s advice and quit the sports he loved.\n\n""The saddest day for me had to be the day of (baseball) try-outs,"" Jordan says. ""I woke up, and I couldn\'t go to try-outs. After that I just started to cope.""\n\nPrecise diagnoses sought\n\nCases of high school athletes collapsing and dying on sports fields most often result from undiagnosed heart defects, says Dr. Jeffrey Towbin, co-director and head of clinical care at the Heart Institute. Victims often show no earlier symptoms, looking the picture of health.\n\nTowbin asked two pediatric cardiologists — Dr. Jeff Anderson and Dr. Michelle Grenier —to take on the study that he\'d wanted to do since joining the Heart Institute 3 and one-half years ago.\n\n""One of our goals is to advance the field … in areas either untouched or unappreciated as being important,"" Towbin says. ""These cases are obviously each a tragic event that occur in every city a few times a year.""\n\nAs high school sports begin this year, the caution takes on increased urgency.\n\nLocally, swimmer Jose Cerda Navarro became unconscious during practice with his private swim club in October 2010. He died within the hour at the hospital, on this 18th birthday.\n\nCameron Batson, 18, died a few weeks before that, while playing a game of pick-up soccer. He had graduated that spring from high school in Covington.\n\nIn the United States, a doctor must approve participation in a school or competitive sports league. Approval is generally granted to teens with little to no family history of heart problems and a physical exam devoid of medical red flags.\n\nSome years ago, Italy instituted a countrywide rule requiring competitive athletes to undergo an electrocardiogram, a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nFewer Italian athletes died after the testing began, but the tests also had a relatively high rate of falsely reporting medical problems. That led to unnecessary physical restrictions of athletes.\n\n""There\'s got to be a better way,"" Anderson said. ""That\'s what we set out to answer.""\n\nAnderson and Grenier now say that adding a limited echocardiogram — a two-dimensional image of the heart — can offer a more precise diagnosis.\n\nNational estimates are that roughly 1% of people are born with potentially life-threatening heart defects. But the Children\'s Hospital study is showing more than twice that rate and a higher rate for more minor abnormalities as well, perhaps because of better technology, Grenier says.\n\n""I do think they\'re real numbers,"" she says of the study\'s findings so far. ""Are they normal variations? What (abnormality) is going to contribute to the overall health versus something that just looks funny? That\'s not entirely known.""\n\nGrenier and her colleagues at the Heart Institute hope to continue this study — turn it into an ongoing program — so they may one day be able to answer those questions. In the meantime, screenings continue.\n\nMaking tests affordable, accessible\n\nA key challenge now is making these tests affordable; most medical insurance plans won\'t cover them. Currently, an EKG and echocardiogram would cost parents a minimum of $2,500, Anderson says.\n\nSimon\'s Fund, a non-profit organization, donated $5,000 to honor Cerda Navarro for screenings. Children\'s Hospital paid the rest, around $42,000, according to Children\'s spokesman Jim Feuer.\n\nIf an ongoing program of testing happens, the hospital would try to tap into third-party funding, donations and grants, Towbin says. ""The hope would be that with data, we could get the entire system interested in participating … get funding to run a clinical trial, locally and maybe nationally.""\n\nAfter Jordan\'s diagnosis, his family packed the room to support him for every subsequent appointment.\n\nHe now takes daily blood pressure medication and is allowed to jog and do other light physical activities.\n\n""He grew up around athletics, so I\'m sure it was a culture shock for him,"" says his grandfather, Lacey Calloway. ""Whatever he does, he knows we\'ve got his back, even if it\'s tiddlywinks.""\n\nSports teaches discipline, Gardner-Davis says, but her son is finding that in other interests. Jordan plays the drums in a high school concert band, is getting into photography and cars — now that he\'s 16. And he got a summer job at Great American Ballpark.\n\nGardner-Davis calls the decision to take him for that screening the ""best decision of my life"" and suggests other parents take advantage of the free service.\n\n""We\'re so thankful,"" she says. ""Otherwise, we\'d have no idea, and Jordan could be standing here one day and gone the next.""']","There is only one team on the field in this story about testing young athletes for heart problems. And in the Gannett family, USA Today simply picked up this Cincinnati Enquirer story and republished it on its website.","Based on interim results from an unfinished study, this story pole vaults to the conclusion that every teen should undergo expensive screening tests. Readers are given little background on the long debate about the effectiveness of such tests. At a time when sedentary lifestyles are a leading threat to health of young people, there is no consideration of the potential harm of labeling hundreds of thousands of teenagers as having “abnormal” hearts.

Now, a small pilot study suggests such a test could be developed.\n\nThe study, of 78 people with and without colon cancer, found that those with the disease tended to have a distinct pattern of chemicals in their breath. And when researchers analyzed the study participants\' breath samples, they correctly identified the colon cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nThe findings, reported online Dec. 5 in the British Journal of Surgery, sound good. But if you\'re waiting for your doctor to offer such a test, don\'t hold your breath.\n\n""It\'s an interesting concept, but this is in the very early stages,"" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colorectal cancers for the American Cancer Society.\n\n""There\'s no way to tell if this would work in the general population,"" said Brooks, who was not involved in the research.\n\nWhat\'s more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. Yet about 40 percent of Americans who should be getting screened are not.\n\n""Colon cancer is a highly preventable disease,"" Brooks said. ""And I would encourage the four out of 10 people who are not taking advantage of the existing screening tools to talk with their doctor.""\n\nThe idea of using a breath test to catch cancer is not new: Researchers are looking into breath tests for detecting a number of cancers, including lung and breast tumors. It\'s all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nWhen it comes to colon cancer, people already have several options for screening, which for most adults should begin at age 50 -- or possibly earlier if you are at higher-than-normal risk.\n\nThe choices include a yearly stool test that looks for hidden blood, or either of two invasive tests that scope the colon: sigmoidoscopy every five years, along with stool testing every three years; or colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nBut many people are turned off by those tests.\n\nSo Dr. Donato Altomare and colleagues at the University Aldo Moro in Bari, Italy, decided to test the feasibility of a breath test.\n\nAnalyzing breath samples from 37 patients with colon cancer and 41 healthy middle-aged adults, the researchers found 15 VOCs that seemed to differ between the two groups.\n\nThey then used a statistical model to see if certain VOC patterns separated the colon cancer patients from the healthy participants. In the end, the researchers were able to correctly identify the cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nBut, Brooks pointed out, that also means the breath test was wrong about one-quarter of the time.\n\nThere\'s no way of knowing how well such a screening test would work in the real world -- including how many people might wrongly get a positive result and undergo needless invasive tests to follow up, Brooks said.\n\nAnother big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps.\n\n""One of our goals in screening is to detect polyps, not cancer,"" Brooks said. ""This study doesn\'t address that.""\n\nAltomare\'s team acknowledges that there is a lot of work left to do. It\'s still unclear which breath chemicals should be measured, or what statistical method is best for weeding out cases of colon cancer.\n\nBrooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests. Yearly stool tests are simple and cheap, but people often don\'t want to do them.\n\n""We\'re always searching for simpler things to do,"" Brooks said. But for now, he added, ""this study raises many more questions than answers.""\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about colon cancer from the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']",An informative take on the value of a new breath test for detecting colon cancer.

The medication, sold under the brand name Avodart, apparently caused small tumors to stop growing or even to shrink, researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA previous study found that a similar drug, finasteride, could also lower the risk of prostate tumors, but the new research -- conducted at 250 sites in 42 countries -- suggests that dutasteride is slightly more effective.\n\nThe new study “is further evidence that there is a role for these drugs in risk reduction,” said Dr. Jack Jacoub, a medical oncologist at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley who was not involved in the study. “If a patient understands all the issues [associated with the drug], I think it would be appropriate to provide it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Howard M. Sandler, an oncologist at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was even more emphatic: “The question might be, why isn’t every man taking one of these drugs? They help people urinate better by shrinking the prostate, they probably reduce baldness, and they reduce the risk of prostate cancer. There seems to be very little downside to them.”\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, which manufactures Avodart, said on Monday that it would apply to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to market the drug for risk reduction in men with high PSA levels -- a measure of prostate cancer risk -- a family history of the disease or other risk factors, such as ethnicity.\n\nBut because the drug is already available, doctors don’t need to wait for such permission to prescribe it as a preventive. Considering its low risk, that might be a safe option, experts said. Insurance companies are not likely to pay for it for that purpose, though, until the FDA approves it.\n\nBoth dutasteride and finasteride, sold by Merck & Co. Inc. under the brand name Proscar, are already approved for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, an enlargement of the prostate gland that causes urinary and other problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProstate tumors and BPH are driven by the male hormone dihydrotestosterone, which is produced from testosterone by two forms of an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. Proscar inhibits one form of the enzyme. Avodart inhibits both forms, especially the form that plays a more prominent role in prostate cancer, “and the expectation is that dutasteride would be a better drug,” said Dr. Gerald Andriole of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who headed the new study.\n\nThat proved to be the case, he said.\n\nAndriole and his colleagues enrolled 8,231 men, ages 50 to 75, who had elevated levels of PSA but no evidence of prostate tumors on a biopsy. Half received dutasteride daily for four years; half received a placebo. The men received biopsies two years after enrollment and again two years later.\n\nOf the 6,729 men who underwent biopsies, 659 taking dutasteride were diagnosed with prostate cancer (19.9%), compared with 858 men (25.1%) taking a placebo -- a 23% reduction. Among men with a family history of prostate cancer, the drug cut risk by 31.4%.\n\nThe risk reduction occurred primarily in tumors of moderate aggressiveness, the type that accounts for about 70% of all prostate tumors in the general population. That means that men “are less likely to be diagnosed with cancer that is not likely to kill them, so they are less likely to undergo aggressive treatment,” Andriole said. “That spares the anxiety of cancer diagnosis and the costs of treatment.”\n\nThe treatment also reduces BPH and its associated problems. A final benefit is that it reduces PSA levels and makes the assay a more sensitive indicator of tumors, a result that will be reported in a separate paper.\n\n“If the PSA level starts rising while a man is on this drug, that is a very strong signal that he has an aggressive tumor” and needs a biopsy, Andriole said.\n\nAbout 5% of the men developed sex-related side effects, including reduced libido, poor erections and complaints about ejaculation, similar to the proportion who suffered them when taking the drug for BPH. Those effects were all reversible if they stopped taking the drug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrice may also be a problem. According to GlaxoSmithKline, the wholesale cost of Avodart is $3.23 per pill. Finasteride is available in a generic form and is thus cheaper.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer in men after skin cancer, affecting 192,000 men per year and killing 27,000. Men who are concerned about their prostate cancer risk can calculate it at: https://deb.uthscsa.edu/URORiskCalc/Pages/uroriskcalc.jsp.

First author is Dipen Parekh, MD, of the University of Miami.\n\nLoyola is among 15 centers that participated in the nationwide trial of 350 patients, who were randomly assigned to undergo robotic surgery or open surgery to remove cancerous bladders.\n\nAfter two years, there was no significant difference between the two groups in survival without disease progression. Robotic surgery was associated with less blood loss and shorter hospital stays, but longer surgeries. There were no significant differences in complication rates or in patients\' quality of life. The study is called RAZOR (randomized open versus robotic cystectomy trial) and was funded by the National Cancer Institute.\n\nA robotic system allows a surgeon to perform operations through a few small incisions. Movements by the surgeon\'s hand or wrist are translated into highly precise movements of the surgical instruments. Every maneuver is directed by the surgeon, in real time, as the surgeon views a magnified, 3D, high-definition image of the surgical site.\n\nSince robotic surgery was introduced in 2000, it has spread rapidly and has been used in about four million surgeries worldwide. But apart from the RAZOR trial, there have been no prospective, randomized multicenter trials to assess how robotic surgery compares to open surgery in cancer survival.\n\nThe RAZOR trial found that two years after surgery, 72.3 percent of patients in the robotic surgery group were alive, with no disease progression and essentially cured, compared with 71.6 percent in the open surgery group. Sixty-seven percent of robotic surgery patients experienced adverse effects such as urinary tract infections and intestinal obstructions, compared with 69 percent in the open surgery group.\n\nRobotic surgery patients stayed a median of six days in the hospital, compared with seven days in the open surgery group. Robotic surgery patients lost less than half as much blood as open surgery patients, but spent more time in the operating room (seven hours, eight minutes compared with six hours, one minute).\n\nResearchers wrote that the findings ""underscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice.""\n\nDr. Gupta added that the study provides evidence demonstrating that the robotic approach performs at least as well as the open approach. ""It is important to conduct these trials before widespread adoption of technology, as has been the case with robotic prostatectomy (removal of the prostate),"" he said.\n\n###\n\nThe study is titled ""Robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer (RAZOR): an open-label, randomized, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.""\n\nBladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men, but it is less common in women. The American Cancer Society estimates this year there will be about 81,000 new cases in the United States, and about 17,000 people will die of the disease.\n\nThe standard surgical treatment of invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder). Three main techniques are used to replace the bladder: construct a new bladder (neobladder) from the patient\'s intestine; place a pouch inside the body to act as an artificial bladder; or place a bag outside the body to collect urine. Loyola Medicine offers both open and robotic radical cystectomy and all three bladder replacement techniques. There are pros and cons to each surgical technique, and Loyola physicians help patients decide which option best fits their lifestyle and health status.\n\nLoyola Medicine is nationally recognized for its expertise in diagnosing and treating a broad range of urologic conditions and providing integrated services for optimal patient care. Loyola\'s department of urology is ranked 39th in the country by U.S. News and World Report.']","While robotic surgery may be “not inferior” to standard therapy for bladder cancer, it does have added costs and a longer procedure time.","This news release about a trial that randomly assigned people with bladder cancer to either robot-assisted or open surgery buried the real news under a weak lead that garbles the findings. The news here is that, contrary to assertions of many proponents of robot-assisted surgery, it is possible to randomize patients in order to get a valuable comparison instead of relying on weaker study designs that can’t answer the fundamental question about how old and new techniques compare. The release is rated as satisfactory on many criteria because key information was included in the body of the release, but the headline proclaiming that robot surgery is “as effective” as open surgery misses the larger point. The headline and lead also put a pro-robot spin on the results, which could also be summarized as robot surgery is “not clearly worse.” Also not explained: robot-assisted surgery is more expensive.

(and then) we can have something ready to be introduced into the clinic,” he told Reuters in Nicosia.\n\nDown’s Syndrome is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation, occurring in 1 out of 700 live births worldwide.\n\nThe risk of having a baby with Down’s — which occurs when a child has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two — increases sharply as women get older. The risk for a 40-year-old mother is 16 times that for one who is 25.\n\nDoctors currently use a test known as amniocentesis to check whether a baby is likely to be born with Down’s. This test is generally done at about 15 or 16 weeks gestation and involves taking amniotic fluid from the mother by inserting a hollow needle into the uterus.\n\nSince amniocentesis carries a small risk of spontaneous miscarriage — Patsalis put it at around one or two percent — scientists have been looking for new less invasive ways to test for Down’s and other potential genetic problems.\n\nPatsalis’ method takes advantage of differences in the DNA methylation patterns — which are important to control levels of genes — between mother and fetus.\n\nIt involves taking a small amount of blood from the mother when she is between the 11th and 13th week of her pregnancy and detecting extra copies chromosome 21 in the fetus by analyzing the maternal blood.\n\nIn a small trial, Patsalis’ team were able to correctly diagnose 14 cases where there were extra copies of the chromosome, and 26 normal fetuses — results they said highlighted its clinical potential.\n\n“Such a non-invasive approach will avoid the risk of miscarriages of normal pregnancies caused by current, more invasive procedures,” the scientists wrote in their paper.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Weaker than the <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3699"" target=""_blank"">HealthDay story</a> we reviewed on the same study.  Our medical editor-reviewer wrote, “mind boggling to use the phrase ‘may soon be available’ on the basis of an early 40-person study.”</span>","This was a single-source story that didn’t adequately explain availability, costs, limitations of the evidence, or potential harms.

When the urge returns, out comes another slap.\n\n\n\nNow imagine those ""slaps"" occurring inside the brain, protecting you in moments of weakness.\n\nIn a report published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stanford neuroscientists say they\'ve achieved this sort of mind-reading in binge-eating mice. They found a telltale pattern of brain activity that comes up seconds before the animals start to pig out — and delivering a quick zap to that part of the brain kept the mice from overindulging.\n\nWhether this strategy could block harmful impulses in people remains unclear. For now the path seems promising. The current study used a brain stimulation device already approved for hard-to-treat epilepsy. And based on the new findings, a clinical trial testing this off-the-shelf system for some forms of obesity could start as early as next summer, says Casey Halpern, the study\'s leader and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Stanford. He thinks the approach could also work for eating disorders and a range of other addictive or potentially life-threatening urges.\n\nAs a physician-researcher, Halpern specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical treatment in which battery-powered implants send electrical pulses to brain areas where signals go awry.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved DBS therapy for movement disorders such as Parkinson\'s disease, tremor and dystonia — usually in people who haven\'t responded well to medications. Occasionally DBS is a last-resort treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nAnother study published Monday in PNAS suggests that DBS could help boost memory and other research is exploring its use for substance abuse and other reward-seeking behaviors.\n\nYears ago, the Stanford team developed a mouse model to test if DBS could curb overeating. Granted, mice don\'t normally gorge themselves. Yet if offered fattier, tastier chow each day for just an hour, within 10 days the mice realize if they ""don\'t eat this now, that guy\'s coming back to take it away,"" Halpern says. So the animals learn to binge.\n\nBut when the researchers applied DBS stimulation to a part of the brain\'s reward circuit known as the nucleus accumbens, the mice quit stuffing themselves.\n\nTrouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals\' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system — one that doesn\'t stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nIn 2013, the FDA approved a newer-generation device, known as a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS), that does just that. Implanted within the brain, it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area. The RNS system costs around $40,000. But with medical devices, Halpern says, hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery, if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is FDA approved. In the current study, Halpern and coworkers tested the RNS device in the binging mice.\n\nFirst, they looked for a biomarker — an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food. Next, the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a 10-second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. For comparison, other animals got continuous DBS stimulation or random pulses.\n\nThe intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols — and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction. It did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse.\n\nThe results point to a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior, says Dennis Turner, a Duke University neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an October review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers. ""That\'s the clear novelty.""\n\nFiguring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging. Few are willing to undergo brain surgery for the purpose of research. But Halpern had a rare opportunity. One of his patients developed OCD so debilitating that he opted for DBS. He agreed to have his brain recorded during the surgery. Since food isn\'t allowed in the operating room, the researchers monitored the patient\'s brain as he anticipated payoffs in a computerized money-making task. As reported in the PNAS paper, the characteristic anticipatory signal appeared when he expected to make $5 but not for smaller sums, suggesting some level of specificity.\n\nOf course, it\'s hard to conclude much from a single subject. But from other research ""we know it\'s safe to place an electrode in the nucleus accumbens, it\'s safe to stimulate it electrically, and we expect to be able to tune [the electrode] as we already do with DBS. So it seems like a nice opportunity,"" says Halpern, noting that addictive disorders haven\'t had new therapies for decades. ""I\'m motivated by the clinical need.""\n\nEsther Landhuis is a freelance science journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area. Follow her at @elandhuis.']","But, the story did a good job discussing costs and laying out the study design for readers.","This article describes some mouse and single-human-subject research at Stanford Medicine about an electrical brain stimulation device that is an offshoot of deep brain stimulation and that appears able to home in on and zap — in real time — the neuronal sudden urges and impulses that go rogue in a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens.
The story did a good job discussing costs and laying out the study design for readers. Also, although the article starts out by spending a lot of time speculating about human benefits, it does eventually make it clear that this is preliminary rodent research. One big gap of the story was not acknowledging that should this idea ever make it to market, it will indeed carry serious risks, including infection, strokes and device failure. Those serious risks (and the steep price tag) may outweigh the benefits.

Unlike conventional methods of HIV prevention, such as condoms or anti-HIV drugs, the implant takes advantage of some people\'s natural immunity to the virus.\n\nHIV infects the body by corrupting T cells that are mobilized by the immune system when the virus enters a person\'s body. When the T cells stay resting and do not attempt to fight the virus they are not infected and the HIV virus is not transmitted between people. When the T cells stay resting, it\'s referred to as being immune quiescent.\n\n""We know that some drugs taken orally never make it to the vaginal tract, so this implant could provide a more reliable way to encourage T cells not to respond to infection and therefore more reliably and cheaply prevent transmission,"" said Emmanuel Ho, a professor in the School of Pharmacy at Waterloo. ""What we don\'t know yet is if this can be a stand-alone option for preventing HIV transmission or if it might be best used in conjunction with other prevention strategies. We aim to answer these questions with future research.""\n\nHo\'s implant was inspired by previous research involving sex workers in Kenya. In Kenya, Ho and research partner Keith Fowke of the University of Manitoba, observed that many of these women who had sex with HIV positive clients but did not contract the virus. They later found the women possessed T cells that were naturally immune quiescent.\n\n""Observing this, we asked ourselves if it was possible to pharmacologically induce immune quiescence with medication that was better assured of reaching the point of infection,"" said Ho. ""By delivering the medication exactly where it\'s needed, we hoped to increase the chances of inducing immune quiescence.""\n\nThe implant is composed of a hollow tube and two pliable arms to hold it in place. It contains hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which is disseminated slowly through the porous material of the tube and absorbed by the walls of the vaginal tract.\n\nThe implants were tested in an animal model and the team observed a significant reduction in T cell activation, meaning that the vaginal tract was demonstrating an immune quiescent state.\n\nThe article recently appeared in the Journal of Controlled Release.\n\n###']","The headline and text repeatedly imply the approach could “prevent women from getting HIV infection,” but saves the fact that the study is in rabbits for the very end.","This very brief news release about a University of Waterloo study looks at a medicated vaginal implant designed to diminish the T-cell immune response to HIV infection.  It’s based on previous observations which suggest that women who may be naturally resistant to HIV infection show low baseline T-cell activation in the vaginal wall. This so-called “immune quiescent” state can be achieved with the medication hydrochloroquine (HCQ) embedded in the implant which, in turn, is embedded in the vagina not unlike an IUD device.
Although the news release does a nice job of describing how the implant works as a medication delivery system, as well how the medicine affects T-cells and subsequently risk for HIV transmission, it falls short in several important ways.
First, even though the language repeatedly implies the approach could “prevent women from getting HIV infection,” it fails to mention the study is in rabbits and can make no claims of efficacy in humans.
Also, claims of efficacy, reliability, and affordability are not backed up with any data whatsoever from the study. There’s also no discussion of potential harms, or just how much more time or research is needed before this implant could be tested in humans.

Your DNA Can Shed Some Light,"['Paxil or Prozac, Zoloft or Lexapro?\n\nWhen treating a patient suffering from depression, Brent Forester considers which anti-depressant to prescribe—ideally, one that will ease psychic pain without side effects.\n\nIt can be a tough call.\n\nDeciding “becomes somewhat of an art—and a lot of it is educated guesswork,” says Dr. Forester, chief of geriatric psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. He worries that sometimes psychiatrists “may think we are better than we really are” at making these choices.\n\nMcLean Hospital psychiatrists Brent Forester, left, and Ipsit Vahia, are occasionally using genomics to help inform decisions about prescribing anti-depressants. Photo: McLean Hospital\n\nThat may change as Dr. Forester and others enlist genomics, a form of precision medicine and an intriguing new frontier for the elusive science of the human psyche. Other branches of medicine, such as oncology, have embraced gene-based testing to help determine which cancer patients need chemotherapy or surgery. But psychiatrists typically haven’t let genomics guide treatment decisions, Dr. Forester says.\n\nOne test, called GeneSight, uses a genetic analysis of DNA samples from a cheek swab to help doctors figure out which drugs are likely to combat a patient’s depression. The test examines a dozen genes to determine how well the patient will metabolize certain drugs and how his or her brain will respond to them.\n\nSupplies and paperwork for a GeneSight test, which analyzes DNA samples from a cheek swab to help determine which drugs are likely to combat depression. Photo: Myriad Genetics\n\nThe test predicts the effects of more than 50 anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. Based on a patient’s results, drugs are categorized as ones to be avoided, ones that have some drawbacks and ones that can be used “as directed.”\n\nBarbara Dellovade, a retired real estate broker in Acton, Mass., became depressed last year. Ms. Dellovade, who is 78 years old, was taking an anti-depressant, but “I wasn’t reacting well to it and it wasn’t helping me at all.” She consulted Ipsit Vahia, a geriatric psychiatrist at McLean Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nMore The Food That Helps Battle Depression\n\nDr. Vahia told Ms. Dellovade about the genomics test, which retails for $1,500 and is covered by Medicare and some health plans. After receiving an analysis of Ms. Dellovade’s results, he switched her to a different anti-depressant and she began to respond in about six weeks, he says. Ms. Dellovade has been feeling better, she says, though “I am still not there.”\n\nDr. Vahia has been using the gene test more with his older depressed patients but says clinical judgment remains paramount in prescribing. “The brain...is the most complex organ in the body,” he says. “This is a small step, but it is an important step. We are adding a degree of precision” to treating depression.\n\nMcLean Hospital is one of 60 sites across the country that took part in a randomized trial of GeneSight. The results, which will be unveiled this week at the American Psychiatric Association meeting, showed that patients fared better when physicians chose a medication with the help of the test, rather than relying solely on their judgment.\n\nAmong the 1,167 patients in the trial, half took the GeneSight test and half were prescribed drugs based purely on their doctors’ clinical assessments. Genetics helps you “marry” a patient with the appropriate medication, says Bryan Dechairo, executive vice president for clinical development at Myriad Genetics, which funded the trial. Assurex Health, a subsidiary of Myriad Genetics, developed the GeneSight test.\n\nThe results were striking, according to doctors at several medical centers who participated in the trial. Patients were more likely to respond to anti-depressants when the gene test was used to determine which drug they should be on; researchers found a 30% greater response to the medicine when the test was applied. Every patient in the trial had been on at least one anti-depressant that failed to work, and some had been on several that failed.\n\nJohn Greden, the principal investigator in the GeneSight trial, is a psychiatrist and executive director of the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Depression Center. Photo: University of Michigan\n\nThe study shows that genetic tests can lead to better prescribing decisions, says John Greden, the principal investigator in the trial. Dr. Greden, a psychiatrist and executive director of the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Depression Center, says that until now, many doctors took the following approach: “My favorite anti-depressant is this one, so I will try it. Oh, that didn’t work, so I will try this one.”\n\nUnfortunately, he says, under that hit-or-miss method—albeit informed by training and experience—“fewer than 40% of patients achieve remission.” Every year, 16 million Americans suffer an episode of depression, he says, making pinpointed diagnoses essential.\n\nSome doctors took a while to come around to the GeneSight test. Charles DeBattista, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine, says initially he was “somewhat skeptical.”\n\n“Prior to the study I used it very rarely,” says Dr. DeBattista, who specializes in patients with treatment-resistant depression. He has been using the test more on patients who “have had problems tolerating medicine in the past,” he says. “There is nothing magical about it; it is not a substitute for clinical judgment.” But it does inform him what drug to try on a patient with serious depression.\n\nHis Stanford colleague Alan Schatzberg isn’t persuaded. The test “has some value,” says Dr. Schatzberg, a psychiatrist and a former president of the American Psychiatric Association. “It has some use but what it doesn’t do is tell you which specific drug to use.” He adds, “What the field really wants is a test that tells me which specific drug I should put my patient on.”\n\nThat is precisely what Charles Conway, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, likes about it. The test “provides recommendations,” Dr. Conway says. “It doesn’t say: ‘Give this drug only.’ It says: ‘You have a range of choices, which you will [make] based on your clinical judgment.’ ”']","But the story did not do enough to establish that the research is still preliminary — it has not been published nor peer-reviewed, and everyone is relying on just a little bit of data released by the company.","This Wall Street Journal article describes results of an unpublished, non-peer-reviewed study of a gene-based test designed to help physicians prescribe antidepressants in people with moderate-to-severe depression who have failed on at least one of the drugs.
The story, both in the narrative and in some quotes, adds some moderating context and healthy skepticism to the enthusiastic “landmark” claims from a company release. It also is clear about the cost ($1,500) of the test offered by Myriad Genetics. But it needed to examine more closely the fact that the test can’t really tell a psychiatrist or other physician which of the dozens of antidepressants may work best–only which are most likely to cause problems and should be avoided. If this is the case, what’s driving the (small) benefit? Is it because people whose treatment was guided by genetic testing experienced fewer side effects and therefore were more likely to adhere to treatment? We’re not told.

And the only patients with positive lymph nodes had microinvasive tumors that were associated with relatively large non-invasive tumors (ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS).\n\n""These findings allow surgeons to select which patients with microinvasive tumors may actually benefit from lymph node sampling, while sparing other patients from this procedure,"" said Tamera Lillemoe, M.D, pathologist and a study co-author.\n\n###\n\nThe study, funded by Engelsma Family Foundation and Abbott Northwestern Hospital Foundation, was published recently in The Breast Journal, the official journal of the National Consortium of Breast Cancers.\n\nAbout Virginia Piper Cancer Institute® - Abbott Northwestern Hospital\n\nThe Virginia Piper Cancer Institute®, part of Allina Health, provides comprehensive care through all aspects of cancer prevention, early detection and treatment to help individuals maintain quality of life and find ways to live with and beyond cancer.

It remains a controversial surgical dilemma, in part, because some studies have found evidence of microinvasive cancer spreading to the lymph nodes 12.5% of the time, while this study, in particular, found the lowest incidence — just 1.5%. The authors conclude that, based on their findings, they believe microinvasive cancer is akin to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in that spread to the lymph nodes is rare.
The researchers conclude from the study that routine node sampling in microinvasive cancer is of questionable benefit.
The news release is very succinct in describing the findings of this small (under 300 patients) single-center study. Readers need more information before they can fairly weigh the researchers’ recommendation. For example, the release only notes that spread to the lymph nodes was found in patients with “relatively large” examples of DCIS, without clarifying what “fairly large” means; doesn’t note the average followup period for study participants, or what the outcomes were at the end of the study such as breast cancer recurrence, distant metastatic disease, or death from breast cancer. The release also does not mention if other tumor factors, such as hormone receptor status, were associated with spread to the lymph nodes.

The new study, which only involved 28 patients, is modest fillip.\n\n“It demonstrated that the drug has an effect on the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease,” lead researcher Juha Rinne from Finland’s University of Turku told Reuters.\n\nRinne and colleagues used a novel imaging substance called carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B, which sticks to areas of the brain where there is a lot of beta amyloid plaque.\n\nAfter 78 weeks, they found that patients given bapineuzumab had about a 25 percent reduction in plaque compared with those on placebo. The effect was similar with three different doses of the drug, they reported in the journal Lancet Neurology.\n\nThe treatment was generally well tolerated, although two patients on the highest dose had transient brain swelling. The drug’s developers have since dropped the top dose from large ongoing Phase III trials.\n\nCommenting on the results, Sam Gandy from New York’s Mount Sinai School of Medicine said it was too early to say effective disease-modifying drugs were at hand, but the ability to measure plaque in living subjects was “something of a breakthrough”.\n\nExperts are divided on the root cause of Alzheimer’s and hence the best way to tackle it.\n\nMost advanced drugs, like bapineuzumab, have focused on removing clumps of amyloid plaques, which are thought to stop brain cells from functioning properly.

The patient noticed improvements in pain levels and mobility, but doctors in the story warn that this treatment is unproven to help patients with delayed radiation injury and that this type of therapy tends to be overused.
Though it is gratifying to hear the patient’s words and the hope that this treatment has provided him, it actually isn’t clear whether the hyperbaric oxygen itself was the reason he got better. The “placebo” effect is well described in the medical literature and refers to sham treatments (fake surgery or pills) leading to benefit. It may also be that the treatment really did help but not for the reasons cited–maybe simply sitting still for hours helped tissues to heal. We do wish the story had explored this aspect more.

And while this study showed some symptomatic improvement, it didn\'t have enough objective data to show that the new technique would surpass surgery, she said.\n\nBenign prostate hyperplasia, also known as enlarged prostate, is a non-cancerous condition familiar to millions of aging males. The condition occurs when the prostate gland slowly enlarges and presses on the urethra, constricting the flow of urine.\n\nEnlarged prostate is characterized by a host of unpleasant symptoms, including weak or slow urine flow, an urgent need to urinate frequently, incomplete bladder emptying and having to get up repeatedly at night to urinate.\n\nThe surgery for enlarged prostate -- transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP -- is used for men whose prostates are smaller than 60 to 80 cubic centimeters. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and involves a hospital stay.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no size limitation for PAE, which requires only local anesthesia and also lowers the risk of other side effects, such as blood loss and retrograde ejaculation, which occurs when semen leaks into the bladder, researchers said. PAE can be an outpatient procedure as well.\n\nFor the procedure, a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin. The catheter delivers tiny ""grains"" to the arteries that lead to the prostate, which block blood flow and lead to shriveling of the gland.\n\nIn this study, PAE helped most of the 67 patients who underwent the procedure, according to the researchers, who noted that 66 men who had not responded to medications experienced improvements in symptoms as well as a reduction in prostate volume. After nine months, none had experienced sexual dysfunction and 25 percent still reported improvements.\n\nHowever, the authors did not see as great an improvement in ""urodynamic"" results, such as improved flow rate of the urine, which would indicate how well the bladder and urethra are performing; in this area, the patients did not improve as much as those who underwent TURP surgery, they noted.\n\nAnother drawback is that few doctors are trained in PAE so far, said Pisco, chair of radiology at Hospital Pulido Valente and professor in the Faculty of Medical Sciences at New University of Lisbon in Portugal.\n\nOther minimally invasive treatments for enlarged prostate that are currently available are less effective and have a greater risk of a need for reoperation, according to background materials that accompanied the study.\n\nDr. Franklin Lowe, associate director of urology at St. Luke\'s-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, said PAE was ""unlikely"" to be used much to treat enlarged prostate.\n\nCurrent surgical procedures typically require no more than one night in the hospital and complications such as incontinence and impotence are uncommon, he said.\n\n""PAE is potentially fraught with complications,"" Lowe said, adding that the study follow-up of less than one year was short for a disease that lasts decades.\n\nSince the study is being presented at a medical meeting and has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the findings should be considered preliminary.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health has more on enlarged prostate.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story dismisses other “minimally invasive treatments” for BPH by citing unspecified “background materials that accompanied the study.”  Huh? </span>","Strong points:  there were several clear caveats, mostly from independent experts interviewed.

REUTERS/Darren Staples\n\nIn the largest study yet of the effect of this type of antidepressant on stroke recovery, French researchers found that stroke patients given Prozac improved their scores in motor skills tests more than those given a placebo, or dummy pill.\n\nExperts commenting on the findings said they had “enormous potential to change clinical practice” and raised the question of whether most stroke patients with motor skill problems should be treated with this relatively cheap type of antidepressant.\n\nStroke is the single largest cause of adult disability and the third-largest cause of death in the developed world.\n\nThe cost of caring for its victims, who often have motor function difficulties like paralysis or weakness on one side, puts a heavy burden on already stretched healthcare systems.\n\nA few previous small trials had already suggested that giving drugs like Prozac, which belongs to a drug class known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), might improve motor skill recovery after stroke.\n\nProzac was developed by Eli Lilly and is now available in a cheaper generic form as fluoxetine.\n\nHemiplegia — paralysis to one side of the body — and hemiparesis — weakness on one side of the body — are the most common disabilities after stroke and scientists believe SSRIs might help improve movement by increasing the level of the brain chemical serotonin in the central nervous system.\n\n“The positive effect of the drug on motor function... suggests that the neuronal ... action of SSRIs provides a new pathway that should be explored further,” said Francois Chollet of Toulouse University Hospital, who led this research.\n\nIn the study, conducted between March 2005 and June 2009 and published in The Lancet Neurology journal Monday, 118 patients in France were given either Prozac or a placebo for three months starting between five and 10 days after they had suffered a stroke.\n\nAll patients were also given physiotherapy, and had their motor skills tested at the start of the trial and on day 90.\n\nSignificantly greater improvements in motor function were recorded after three months in patients taking Prozac, where the average test score improved by 34.0 points, than in the placebo group, where the average improvement was 24.3 points.\n\nThere were also more independent patients and depression was less common in the Prozac group than in the placebo group, and side effects of the drug were rare and mild, researchers said.\n\nCommenting on the study, Robert Robinson and Harold Adams from the University of Iowa in the United States, said it could change the way doctors treat stroke victims in future, but more research is needed to see if the effects continue over time.\n\nRoger Bonomo, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said another way to look at the implications of this trial would be as justification for treatment of post-stroke depression before it progresses.\n\n“Depression after stroke is a common enough complication to have raised the question of treating with antidepressants early after stroke,” he said in an emailed comment. “If motor function is also more likely to improve, then treating before symptoms of depression emerge is likely to be even more beneficial.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">This story’s single sentence about the need for longer studies is far from sufficient balance to the array of forward-looking statements based on early evidence.<br/>

(Photo: Dima Gavrysh / AP)\n\nChicago — Local bans on artery-clogging trans fats in restaurant foods led to fewer heart attacks and strokes in several New York counties, a new study suggests.\n\nThe study hints at the potential for widespread health benefits from an upcoming nationwide ban, the authors and other experts say. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 gave the food industry until next year to eliminate artificial trans fats from American products.\n\nNew York City enacted a restaurant ban on the fats in 2007 and several counties in the state did the same. Hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes in those areas declined 6 percent starting three years after the bans, compared with counties without bans. The results translate to 43 fewer heart attacks and strokes per 100,000 people, said lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, a Yale University cardiology fellow.\n\nHis study was published Wednesday in JAMA Cardiology.\n\nTrans fats, also called partially hydrogenated oils, enhance food texture and structure. They were once commonly used to make restaurant fried chicken, French fries, doughnuts and other foods and found in grocery items including cookies, crackers and margarine.\n\nThese fats can boost blood levels of unhealthy cholesterol, increasing risks for heart problems. The FDA in 2006 required them to be listed on food labels and the food industry has been switching to healthier oils.\n\nThe researchers examined hospital admissions data from 2002 to 2013 in 11 New York counties that adopted bans and in 25 counties that did not. Admissions for heart attacks and strokes declined in all counties, going from more than 800 to less than 700 per 100,000 people, but the drop was steeper in counties that enacted bans.\n\nAlice Lichtenstein, a heart and nutrition specialist at Tufts University’s Boston campus, said the results are encouraging but that other changes could have contributed, such as smoking bans and mandatory calories on menus.\n\nDr. Mark Creager, former American Heart Association president, said the results echo previous studies “and are consistent with the thinking of most scientists” on potential benefits of these bans.\n\n“Policies such as these when adapted on a nationwide level will be good for our entire population,” said Creager, director of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s heart center in Lebanon, New Hampshire.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The comparison found a modest decline in individuals hospitalized for heart attacks in the trans fat-restricted counties.
However, the study design could not establish causality, so the research could only conclude that it had found a link. Although the headline admirably opted for the term “linked,” the story lede translates that into a causal statement–the ban “led to fewer heart attacks and strokes.” Another story we reviewed, by Reuters Health, was more cautious.
But otherwise, this story hit a lot of high notes, especially when it came to discussing the benefits measured by the study.
