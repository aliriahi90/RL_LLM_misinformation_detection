""This is due to an extra chromosome 21, and that leads to physical and mental impairment.""\n\n""With our method we identify all normal and all Down syndrome [pregnancies],"" Patsalis said.\n\nCurrently, Down syndrome is diagnosed using one of two invasive procedures, amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Because these tests, while 80 percent accurate, carry a 1 percent to 2 percent risk of miscarriage, only about one in 10 pregnant women opts for them, he said.\n\nThe new test eliminates the risk of miscarriage, Patsalis said.\n\nIt also can identify Down syndrome in the 11th week of pregnancy, early enough for a woman to end her pregnancy if she chooses, Patsalis said.\n\nAlthough Down syndrome varies in severity, it usually causes some intellectual impairment and distinguishing facial features. Heart defects and other health problems are also common, according to the March of Dimes. Older mothers are more likely to give birth to Down syndrome babies.\n\nPeople with Down syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, carry three copies of chromosome 21, instead of two.\n\nFor the study, published online March 6 in Nature Medicine, Patsalis and his colleagues took blood samples from pregnant women and mothers of Down syndrome and healthy babies. In each case, the test quickly pinpointed the chromosomal variation, identifying 14 Down syndrome cases and 26 normal fetuses, the study authors said.\n\nIf larger clinical trials confirm the results, the test could become standard practice, Patsalis said. ""The cost is much lower than the invasive procedures,"" he said. ""We estimate we can introduce this to clinical practice in a couple of years.""\n\nDr. Brian Skotko, clinical fellow in genetics at Children\'s Hospital Boston and a spokesman for the National Down Syndrome Society, said this study has widespread implications for the incidence of Down syndrome.\n\nWith this new test, women will know if their baby has Down syndrome even before they look pregnant, Skotko said. ""So they will be able to make a very personal decision without anyone realizing it,"" he said.\n\nNoting that most of his Down syndrome patients say they lead fulfilling lives, Skotko said, ""The overwhelming majority of family members say they can\'t imagine their life without their family member with Down syndrome.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on Down syndrome, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story was slightly better than its </span>","Good examples:

Furthermore, restarting therapy with the new oral anticoagulant dabigatran was associated with a lower risk of recurrent hemorrhage in these cases than the old standby drug warfarin.\n\nPeople take anticoagulants to avoid blood clots when they have a risk for stroke or heart attack, but the downside is that these medications increase a person\'s risk of severe bleeding--such as in the brain or gut--because the blood isn\'t clotting as well as it otherwise might.\n\n""If a patient who is on an anticoagulant to avoid a stroke has a major bleeding event, doctors are faced with a catch-22: Discontinue the anticoagulant to avoid future bleeding, but again place their patient at increased risk of stroke; or resume the anticoagulant to continue avoiding a stroke, but then have to worry about another bleeding event,"" said lead author Inmaculada Hernandez, Pharm.D., Ph.D., an assistant professor in Pitt\'s School of Pharmacy, who completed this work as a doctoral student at Pitt\'s Graduate School of Public Health.\n\n""It causes a lot of uncertainty for physicians, especially because patients at highest risk of recurrent bleeding also are at highest risk of stroke,"" said co-author Yuting Zhang, Ph.D., associate professor of health policy and management at Pitt Public Health, and Hernandez\'s doctoral dissertation committee chair.\n\nThe Pitt research team obtained data from 2010 to 2012 for a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries.

More than 1,500 of those people suffered a major bleeding event while using one of the drugs. About half of those people resumed one of the two anticoagulants a few months after the bleeding, while the others did not.\n\nThe risk of dying from any cause or having a stroke was 23 to 34 percent higher in patients who discontinued anticoagulation therapy compared to those who resumed it. People who took dabigatran after their initial bleeding event had nearly half the risk of another major bleeding event within one year compared with those who took warfarin.\n\n""Our results should encourage clinicians to seriously consider resuming anticoagulation among patients who survived a major bleeding event, particularly if the source of bleeding was identified and addressed,"" said senior author Samir Saba, M.D., associate professor of medicine and associate chief of cardiology at UPMC Heart and Vascular Institute.

14,story_reviews_01113,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3884/,2011-05-02 04:00:00,Tailored medicine could prevent more heart attacks,"['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - National guidelines help doctors decide how to treat high blood pressure. But tailoring those guidelines to better fit individuals could prevent many more heart attacks and strokes, say developers of a computer model that makes those calculations.\n\nTheir study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, estimated the effects of using “individualized guidelines” to make decisions on treating high blood pressure.\n\nIt found that the tailored approach could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than the simpler, general recommendations used now.\n\nCurrently, U.S. guidelines recommend treatment if blood pressure rises above 140/90 mm Hg, or above 130/80 mm Hg if a person has diabetes or chronic kidney disease.\n\nDoctors generally add their own judgment to that decision as well. If, for instance, a person has slightly elevated blood pressure but is otherwise at low risk for heart problems, then lifestyle changes might be enough.\n\nBut the new study looked at a more sophisticated way of estimating individual patients’ needs. Researchers used a computer-based “risk calculator” that took into account a person’s age, cholesterol levels, family history of heart disease and any diabetes diagnosis.\n\nIt also factored in what’s known about different types of patients’ responses to various blood pressure medications.\n\nThe researchers then used data from a long-term study of 15,800 Americans to estimate the effects of applying the individualized guidelines.\n\nOverall, they found, the tailored method could prevent 43 percent more heart attacks and strokes than national guidelines, if healthcare costs were kept the same.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the number of heart attacks and strokes prevented were kept the same, the individualized guidelines would accomplish that result at a 67 percent cost savings versus the national guidelines.\n\nThe goal of using the risk calculator “is the same as the physician’s desire to take into account the ‘whole patient’ when discussing treatment options with patients,” said lead researcher Dr. David M. Eddy.\n\nThe problem with the old-fashioned way, he told Reuters Health in an email, is that there are many pieces of information about a patient to consider.\n\n“It is impossible for the human brain to digest it all and estimate accurately the patient’s risks or how they would benefit from treatments,” he said.\n\nAccording to Eddy, risk calculators like the one in the study could, eventually, help doctors give patients real numbers. A doctor might tell you, for example, what your risk is of developing diabetes in the next 20 years, and how much you could cut that risk if you lose a certain amount of weight (and keep it off).\n\nEddy is a founder of Archimedes, Inc., a San Francisco-based company that has developed a computer-based mathematical model to aid in healthcare decisions. The calculator used in this study is a simplified version of that model.\n\nEddy said that the calculator, or others like it, could be integrated into electronic health records. A patient’s information could be automatically fed to the calculator, and the results would then be displayed on a computer for the doctor and patient to discuss.\n\nA researcher not involved in the work said it was a “nice study” that is a first step toward showing that tailored guidelines could have benefits.\n\n“This shows that there might be better ways for physicians to choose who gets treated and who does not,” said Dr. Douglas K. Owens of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System in California, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nGeneral guidelines, like those for treating high blood pressure, are kept fairly simple so they are easy to remember, Owens told Reuters Health in an interview. Doctors, ideally, then adapt those guidelines to individual patients’ situations.\n\nHowever, Owens said, “it’s hard to do all of that in your head. This gives them a tool.”\n\nNow the looming questions are how to implement risk calculators in doctors’ practices — and, Owens said, whether that benefits patients’ health in the real world.\n\n“The general theme is that we can do better, and we may have an opportunity to improve patients’ health outcomes,” Owens said. “That’s the hope.”\n\nHe said he thinks electronic health records will be key to putting individualized guidelines into practice.\n\nAnd right now, there is a way to go before most doctors will have those systems in place.\n\nA recent government survey found that the percentage of U.S. doctors using electronic health records is on the rise, but still fairly low.\n\nAbout one-quarter of surveyed doctors said they had “basic” electronic medical record systems in their offices. Only about 10 percent had a “fully functional” system that included extensive information on patients’ medical history.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/an7XRm Annals of Internal Medicine, online May 2, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Interesting story on an important area of research – individualized medicine driven by computerized risk calculators that might someday be embedded in electronic health record systems. </span>","The story addressed most of our criteria, but we felt it could have been improved a bit by even brief mention of the cost impact of implementing such a system, and a little more context on the Archimedes system and related research.

24,story_reviews_01343,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3284/,2010-10-27 04:00:00,Do Cortisone Shots Actually Make Things Worse?,"['In the late 1940s, the steroid cortisone, an anti-inflammatory drug, was first synthesized and hailed as a landmark. It soon became a safe, reliable means to treat the pain and inflammation associated with sports injuries (as well as other conditions). Cortisone shots became one of the preferred treatments for overuse injuries of tendons, like tennis elbow or an aching Achilles, which had been notoriously resistant to treatment. The shots were quite effective, providing rapid relief of pain.\n\nBallyscanion/Getty Images\n\nThen came the earliest clinical trials, including one, published in 1954, that raised incipient doubts about cortisone’s powers. In that early experiment, more than half the patients who received a cortisone shot for tennis elbow or other tendon pain suffered a relapse of the injury within six months.\n\nBut that cautionary experiment and others didn’t slow the ascent of cortisone (also known as corticosteroids). It had such a magical, immediate effect against pain. Today cortisone shots remain a standard, much-requested treatment for tennis elbow and other tendon problems.\n\nBut a major new review article, published last Friday in The Lancet, should revive and intensify the doubts about cortisone’s efficacy. The review examined the results of nearly four dozen randomized trials, which enrolled thousands of people with tendon injuries, particularly tennis elbow, but also shoulder and Achilles-tendon pain. The reviewers determined that, for most of those who suffered from tennis elbow, cortisone injections did, as promised, bring fast and significant pain relief, compared with doing nothing or following a regimen of physical therapy. The pain relief could last for weeks.\n\nBut when the patients were re-examined at 6 and 12 months, the results were substantially different. Over all, people who received cortisone shots had a much lower rate of full recovery than those who did nothing or who underwent physical therapy. They also had a 63 percent higher risk of relapse than people who adopted the time-honored wait-and-see approach. The evidence for cortisone as a treatment for other aching tendons, like sore shoulders and Achilles-tendon pain, was slight and conflicting, the review found. But in terms of tennis elbow, the shots seemed to actually be counterproductive. As Bill Vicenzino, the chairman of sports physiotherapy at the University of Queensland in Australia and senior author of the review, said in an e-mail response to questions, “There is a tendency” among tennis-elbow sufferers “for the majority (70-90 percent) of those following a wait-and-see policy to get better” after six months to a year. But this is not the case for those getting cortisone shots, he wrote; they “tend to lag behind significantly at those time frames.” In other words, in some way, the cortisone shots impede full recovery, and compared with those adopting a wait-and-see policy, those getting the shots “are worse off.” Those people receiving multiple injections may be at particularly high risk for continuing damage. In one study that the researchers reviewed, “an average of four injections resulted in a 57 percent worse outcome when compared to one injection,” Dr. Vicenzino said.\n\nWhy cortisone shots should slow the healing of tennis elbow is a good question. An even better one, though, is why they help in the first place. For many years it was widely believed that tendon-overuse injuries were caused by inflammation, said Dr. Karim Khan, a professor at the School of Human Kinetics at the University of British Columbia and the co-author of a commentary in The Lancet accompanying the new review article. The injuries were, as a group, given the name tendinitis, since the suffix “-itis” means inflammation. Cortisone is an anti-inflammatory medication. Using it against an inflammation injury was logical.\n\nBut in the decades since, numerous studies have shown, persuasively, that these overuse injuries do not involve inflammation. When animal or human tissues from these types of injuries are examined, they do not contain the usual biochemical markers of inflammation. Instead, the injury seems to be degenerative. The fibers within the tendons fray. Today the injuries usually are referred to as tendinopathies, or diseased tendons.\n\nWhy then does a cortisone shot, an anti-inflammatory, work in the short term in noninflammatory injuries, providing undeniable if ephemeral pain relief? The injections seem to have “an effect on the neural receptors” involved in creating the pain in the sore tendon, Dr. Khan said. “They change the pain biology in the short term.” But, he said, cortisone shots do “not heal the structural damage” underlying the pain. Instead, they actually “impede the structural healing.”\n\nStill, relief of pain might be a sufficient reason to champion the injections, if the pain “were severe,” Dr. Khan said. “But it’s not.” The pain associated with tendinopathies tends to fall somewhere around a 7 or so on a 10-point scale of pain. “It’s not insignificant, but it’s not kidney stones.”\n\nSo the question of whether cortisone shots still make sense as a treatment for tendinopathies, especially tennis elbow, depends, Dr. Khan said, on how you choose “to balance short-term pain relief versus the likelihood” of longer-term negative outcomes. In other words, is reducing soreness now worth an increased risk of delayed healing and possible relapse within the year?\n\nSome people, including physicians, may decide that the answer remains yes. There will always be a longing for a magical pill, the quick fix, especially when the other widely accepted and studied alternatives for treating sore tendons are to do nothing or, more onerous to some people, to rigorously exercise the sore joint during physical therapy. But if he were to dispense advice based on his findings and that of his colleagues’ systematic review, Dr. Vicenzino said, he would suggest that athletes with tennis elbow (and possibly other tendinopathies) think not just once or twice about the wisdom of cortisone shots but “three or four times.”']","The story brought clarity to a complicated and confusing topic. It offered important take-home messages for patients and healthcare providers alike—at least in the area of tennis elbow, where the evidence is most compelling.","A New York Times article asks the provocative question “Do steroid injections actually make things worse?”—referring to the treatment of chronic tendon problems such as tennis elbow, rotator cuff symptoms, jumper’s knee, and pain in the Achilles tendon.

The medical establishment has traditionally supported the view that steroid injections for tennis elbow can deliver remarkable short-term pain relief without compromising long-term outcomes.  However, in light of recent evidence, this appears to be an erroneous conclusion.
The new review found that the early pain relief provided by the injections comes at a substantial long-term cost.  All too often steroid injections appear to compromise the healing process. The pain relief at one month frequently gives way to increasing pain and disability at six months and one year.  Exercise, physical therapy, and doing nothing may all lead to better long-term outcomes.
So does the new review kill steroid injections as a treatment for tennis elbow? Not at all. But as the Times article pointed out, the new evidence will allow patients to carefully assess both the benefits and risks of steroid injections as well as other therapies.  And they will be able choose a treatment that aligns with their own goals and tolerance for risk.
As the journalist explained, the new systematic review could not find conclusive evidence about the short- or long-term benefits of steroid injections for other chronic tendon problems. But this is also an important conclusion. Those who choose steroid injections for rotator cuff problems, jumper’s knee, and Achilles’ symptoms can do so in the knowledge that they are opting for an uNPRoven therapy.
The New York Times article is not perfect. It did not fully address all of our criteria. It did not comprehensively characterize the pain outcomes for tennis elbow in easy-to-understand statistics—and did not provide any information on the costs of various approaches.  But these omissions relate largely to the way the systematic review expressed its composite results rather than a lack of work on the journalist’s part.
There were some live quotes in the article—with commentary from the senior author of the systematic review and one of the editorialists. Ideally, one would have liked to see additional commentary from someone not involved in either publication. However, finding someone familiar with all the evidence on steroid injections for tendon problems on short notice is a tall order. So by almost any standard this is an impressive article.

Eventually, the overwhelmed system leaves these sugars, in the form of glucose, to build up in the blood, which can lead to obesity, damage the heart, and cause other metabolic problems.\n\nAnd while insulin injections are an effective way to break down the glucose, keeping track of blood sugar levels with regular finger pricks and repeated insulin shots aren’t an ideal way to treat a chronic disease. But despite decades of research, scientists haven’t found a better way to address the problem.\n\nMORE: Half of Diabetes Cases Are Undiagnosed\n\nNow, researchers working with mice at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute report in the journal Cell that they have discovered a hormone, betatrophin, that can prompt the body to generate more insulin-producing beta cells and, if the work is confirmed, the hormone could potentially do away with the need for regular insulin shots.\n\n“We don’t understand the cause of type 2 diabetes, but everyone agrees that having more beta cells is better,” says Douglas Melton, senior author of the paper and co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. “No one doubts that’s not a good idea.”\n\nMORE: Should You Take Statins? Study Says Heart Benefits Outweigh Diabetes Risk\n\nIt’s an exciting breakthrough in diabetes research, which for many years was focused on finding ways to externally supplement the body’s waning insulin levels. That’s because experts believed that once the pancreatic islet cells, the body’s insulin-making factories, were compromised, they couldn’t be made to work again. What’s more, they also surmised that only a specialized set of beta cells were equipped to make insulin, and that once diabetes set in, too few of these cells remained to pump out the critical hormone.\n\nMelton, however, whose work focuses on understanding how stem cells might enhance beta cell production, admits that he is “obsessed” with the insulin-making cells, and reported in 2007 that all beta cells appeared to have the ability to produce insulin. His pursuit of a better understanding of this population, and the forces that cause them to falter in diabetes, led his team to the discovery of betatrophin.\n\nMORE: Stem Cell Research: The Quest Resumes\n\nIn animal studies, mice that were treated with another compound that compromised their ability to respond to insulin suddenly revved up production of more beta cells to compensate, and Melton’s team was able to isolate the hormone responsible – betatrophin. Over the course of a few weeks, mice bred to develop diabetes but injected with betatrophin were increased their beta cell population by 17 times. “I was impressed by the fact that the number of beta cells in the mice doubled in one week with one injection,” says Melton. “That’s a huge difference.”\n\nWhat’s more, it appears the cells are relatively long-lasting, which could indicate they are robust enough to bring glucose levels in diabetics under control.\n\nIn theory, if the same results occur in people, it’s possible that those on the verge of developing diabetes might never progress to develop the disease, since the high blood sugar levels that can cause damage to tissues and lead the body to become less responsive to insulin could be avoided. It’s also possible that diabetics could lower their dependence on insulin and might even be able to wean themselves off of the injection altogether if their beta cell production is robust enough to provide the insulin they need.\n\nMORE: Type 2 Diabetes Is Tougher to Treat in Kids and Teens\n\n“Even if it doesn’t address insulin resistance, what [betatrophin] will do is lower blood sugar, and anything that lowers blood sugar can make you healthier,” he says.\n\nMore work will be needed to confirm what benefit betatrophin might have on diabetic patients before that might be possible, however. John Anderson, president of medicine and science for the American Diabetes Association, says “It’s very promising and opens up new avenues of research, but we are a long way from replacing insulin, or a cure, or even knowing how this [hormone] will work in human tissue.”\n\nThose concerns aren’t lost on Melton, who also recognizes that more research is needed to confirm that betatrophin may benefit patients. “I am aware of the fact that given our level of ignorance, everything seems simple and straightforward,” he says. “But I am prepared to have it become more complicated.”']","If you skim too quickly, you’ll miss that this “breakthrough” in type 2 diabetes research came from a study of mice — not humans. The story may have overstated the promise of bench research.","This story describes the discovery of a hormone, called betatrophin, that can cause mice to produce more of the cells that secrete insulin. The “mice” part is important, but the story didn’t address it or explore its implications in a satisfactory way. Instead, it focused mainly on speculation that the discovery would lead to a treatment that can manage diabetes more effectively or even prevent it from developing in the first place. The lone note of caution is relegated to the very end of the story, where few readers are likely to see it.

But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.\n\nResearchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde\'s action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too.\n\n""Scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism,"" said Wu, who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the U-M Medical School. ""So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells.""\n\nTheir findings, which appear in the December issue of the journal Metabolism, indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells, or adipocytes, inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis.\n\nWu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages, ethnicities and body mass indices. When the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde, the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism. They also observed an increase in Ucp1 and Fgf21, which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis.\n\nAdipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids. This long-term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors, who had much less access to high-fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat. That fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures, which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat.\n\n""It\'s only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem,"" Wu said. ""Throughout evolution, the opposite--energy deficiency--has been the problem. So any energy-consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn\'t need it.""\n\nWith the rising obesity epidemic, researchers like Wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis, turning those fat-burning processes back on.\n\nWu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method. And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen.\n\n""Cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years, and people generally enjoy it,"" Wu said. ""So if it can help protect against obesity, too, it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to.""\n\nNow, before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday-season pounds at bay, Wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde\'s metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.\n\n###\n\nThe research was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program, Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. Foundation, National Institutes of Health and American Heart Association.\n\nOther study authors were: Juan Jiang, Margo Emont, Heejin Jun, Xiaona Qiao, Jiling Liao and Dong-il Kim, all of U-M.\n\nThe study is titled ""Cinnamaldehyde induces fat cell-autonomous thermogenesis and metabolic reprogramming,"" DOI: 10.1016/j.metabol.2017.08.006.']","Maybe it’s too early for a news release, too.","Cinnamon, or more specifically cinnamaldehyde, the essential oil that gives cinnamon its flavor, has been the focus of mouse studies on reversing obesity. This news release reports on a study that uses human stem-cell-derived fat cells to test if and how cinnamaldehyde activates fat metabolism in these fat cells. The news release reports that thermogeneisis — energy conversion that produces heat — is the way cinnamaldehyde activates fat cells to use fat.
The release suggests that cinnamaldehyde might be a better alternative to synthesized drugs to reduce obesity because people might be more willing to stick with a regimen based on cinnamon.  They caution, however, that more research needs to be done and that people should not go out and try this at this time because of potential side effects.

Experts have blamed prescription opioids for spikes in overdoses, and some patients simply might not want to be given an opioid, or their injury doesn\'t require something so strong.\n\nIn Stowe, for example, a woman who dislocated her shoulder asked not to be given narcotics because she was recovering from addiction, Brinkman said.\n\nThe drug also bridges the gap between a cold pack and narcotics, said Michael Chiarella, director of operations at Richmond Rescue in Richmond, Vermont, which also handles many injuries suffered at a nearby ski resort.\n\nThe drug is delivered by breathing through a mask or tube that the patient holds so they can regulate how much they are getting.\n\n""It\'s fast-acting and it wears off,"" said Jeremy Oleson, an advanced EMT and chief of the fire department in Twin Mountain, New Hampshire.\n\nNitrous was used on some ambulances in the 1980s and 1990s until the product line was sold. The portable product is now back on the market with another manufacturer.\n\nThe renewed use of nitrous on ambulances comes as some states have begun to allow advanced EMTs, which have less training than paramedics, to administer it, in line with national guidelines.\n\nStowe, a largely volunteer squad, is adding a unit to a second ambulance this fall at a cost of about $3,800, plus costs for disposable supplies and some cleaning agents, as well as the nitrous cylinders, which cost about $14 to refill. Brinkman estimates the drug costs less than $10 per use once the equipment is purchased.\n\nNot all is rosy. Nitrous oxide in and of itself has the potential to be used as a recreational drug and can be misused by providers and patients, or can be stolen for personal use or sale on the street, according to the American Ambulance Association.\n\nAnd while it has its advantages, nitrous oxide also can cause nausea, vomiting and light-headedness, which could cause complications with some patients, said Dr. Edward Yaghmour, chairman of the American Society of Anesthesiologists\' Committee on Obstetric Anesthesia.\n\nThe gas cannot be used in patients with head injuries, or who have abdominal pain or pulmonary concerns.\n\nNitrous helped Nick Chegwidden, an EMT himself, after he fell while skiing at Stowe Mountain Resort in March and the edge of his ski cut his leg.\n\nHis adrenaline kicked in, he said, but by the time the ambulance arrived 30 to 40 minutes later, he was in pain. He couldn\'t move his foot, so he was also having anxiety. The advanced EMT crew gave him nitrous.\n\n""So for the transport,"" he said, ""I was calm and comfortable.""']","And, because the specter of the nation’s opioid epidemic is raised, we end up with a story that creates disease mongering around addiction to painkillers when it could have just as easily followed a more informative path.","This story on the use of nitrous oxide in ambulances seems to come out of nowhere, which is often a good starting point for a news story. It covers the costs of the drug. It quotes multiple sources. It discusses the harms of the drug. But it also fails to answer too many questions. Deep in this story about nitrous oxide being used on ambulances, we catch a glimpse of a story that is still to be written. It’s in one sentence that reads, “The renewed use of nitrous on ambulances comes as some states have begun to allow advanced EMTs, which have less training than paramedics, to administer it, in line with national guidelines.”
The question could have been: “Are local governments, in search of lower costs associated with emergency medical care, looking for new ways to cut corners?” Instead, the story presents us with a few anecdotes about the use of nitrous oxide in ambulances. It is unclear whether the actual number of people being given nitrous oxide is really on the rise. It is unclear whether there are true benefits to using it. It is unclear how it stacks up against alternatives. And because the specter of the nation’s opioid epidemic is raised, we end up with a story that creates disease mongering around addiction to painkillers when it could have just as easily followed a more informative path.

""This definitely has potential.""\n\nThe minimally invasive procedure involves using a small brush to collect a smattering of cells from the windpipe (a bronchoscopy), explained study co-author Andrea Bild, an assistant professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.\n\nMaybe one day, screening could be done using an even simpler nasal or sputum test, the researchers said.\n\nCurrently, there is no good way to detect lung cancer -- the number one cancer killer -- in its early stages when it\'s most treatable. By the time most lung cancers are diagnosed -- which usually involves an invasive examination of the lungs -- patients already have advanced malignancies. Only 15 percent of patients are still alive at five years, said Nana-Sinkam.\n\nCigarette smoking is responsible for 90 percent of all lung cancer cases in the United States.\n\nStill, only 10 to 20 percent of smokers actually develop lung cancer, begging the question: Why do some smokers succumb to the disease and others don\'t.\n\nNow genomics may have provided an answer.\n\nWorking on the theory that cigarettes harm not only the lungs but a ""field of injury"" extending to other areas of the respiratory tract, the study authors surmised that evidence of existing or soon-to-develop lung cancer might be available further up in the airway.\n\nThe researchers used so-called microarray genetic analysis to measure gene expression levels in the epithelial cells -- those cells lining the respiratory tract -- that they had captured with the bronchoscopy.\n\n""We were looking at the activity of genes in the cells that we obtained from the windpipe or airways of smokers at risk for lung cancer,"" said study senior author Dr. Avrum Spira, a critical care physician at Boston Medical Center and associate professor of medicine, pathology and bioinformatics at Boston University School of Medicine.\n\nIt turned out that gene activity in the PI3K pathway was ""off the chart"" in smokers with lung cancer versus those without the disease.\n\n""Obviously that\'s very exciting,"" Spira said. ""We have identified a marker for an early risk of developing lung cancer.""\n\nAnd when treated with the compound myo-inositol, the gene pathway activity declined along with improvement in the troublesome lesions, the researcher noted.\n\n""This drug inhibits the pathway that\'s activated in smokers. The drug is a natural compound. You can get it in health-food stores,"" Spira said.\n\n""We\'re now in the midst of a large study to look at whether or not activity of this pathway can be used to pick those who could benefit from this as a treatment as opposed to just prevention,"" said Spira, who is a co-founder of Allegro Diagnostics Inc., a company that plans to market this biomarker.\n\nThe researchers also need to explore whether or not the PI3K pathway is active in non-smokers, as well as what other pathways might also trigger lung cancer.\n\nThe study findings were published in the April 7 issue of the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on lung cancer.']",This was the weakest of the three stories we reviewed on this same study (the others done by AP and Reuters).  Read more to find out why. ,"This story is based upon new research that examines genes and biochemical pathways associated with lung cancer in smokers with and without lung cancer.  This would allow lung cancer to be detected in its early, more treatable stages or before it developed.

But in recent years, scientists have made some breakthrough discoveries about how we age on the inside, right down to our genes. The science of aging has created a glimmer of hope that we could someday slow the process — a dream that has already spread beyond the lab to the marketplace.\n\n\n\nAnti-aging research used to be mainly about finding new ways to get lab mice to take their vitamins. But if you visited a lab today, you\'d be more likely to hear scientists talking excitedly about telomeres, protective strands of DNA at the end of chromosomes that seem to play an important — some would say crucial — role in aging.\n\n\n\nWhenever a healthy cell divides, the telomeres get a little shorter. In fact, you could tell a lot about the age of a person simply by looking at the length of his or her telomeres. Studies have found that in people older than 60, short telomeres are one sign that the end may be relatively near: Older people with short telomeres seem to be especially vulnerable to disease, including heart disease and infections. But telomeres aren\'t as reliable as a clock or even a tree ring. Recent studies suggest that you can help your telomeres stay relatively long and youthful if you get regular exercise, eat a healthful diet and avoid stress.\n\n\n\nAt a time when people are willing to spend big bucks to look and feel younger, it\'s not surprising that telomeres have become a buzzword in the supplement industry. One expensive option, TA-65, supposedly works by stimulating telomerase, a natural enzyme that helps restore telomeres after a cell divides. (The TA stands for ""telomerase activator."")\n\n\n\nCreated by Geron Corp., a biotech research company, TA-65 contains extracts of astragalus, an herb often used as an immunity-booster in traditional Chinese medicine. Although TA-65 is legally classified as a dietary supplement, TA Sciences, the company that bought the licensing rights from Geron, makes it available only through select doctors who have paid a fee and have passed a test on telomere biology. Seven doctors offer TA-65 in California, including two in Los Angeles, according to the company website.\n\n\n\nWhen TA-65 was first released in 2007, patients spent $25,000 a year on the supplement and accompanying tests. Now patients spend $1,200 to $4,000 for a six-month supply, depending on the dose. The company recommends taking the supplement for two years. Patients must spend an additional $500 on doctor\'s fees, and they have the option of spending several hundred to a couple of thousand dollars more on tests to check the results.\n\n\n\nReneuve, a supplement sold online, supposedly lengthens telomeres by giving users an extra-large dose of telomerase. You won\'t see telomerase in the list of ingredients, but Reneuve does offer ""select proprietary glandular extracts"" from pig thymuses that provide ""enough telomerase enzyme for the cellular infrastructure of one adult.""\n\n\n\nA single 30-milliliter vial of Reneuve purchased through the company website costs $250. Users are instructed to drink the vial in a single sitting, perhaps with some Mountain Dew or Gatorade. The effects are said to last six months.\n\n\n\nClaims\n\n\n\nThe TA Science website says the company ""is the first and only … in the world to offer Telomerase-Activating products to combat the effects of aging through leading-edge science."" Company founder Noel Patton says, ""Our product is not the fountain of youth. You won\'t miraculously turn into a 20-year-old again. But it is a fountain of youth for certain cells.""\n\n\n\nSpecifically, Patton says, the product will ""strengthen and rejuvenate"" the immune system. He points to an unpublished company-run study that compared an astragalus supplement similar to TA-65 to a placebo in 36 men ages 60 to 85. The study reportedly found that men who took the supplement for six months developed stronger immune system cells, better eyesight, improved sexual satisfaction and younger-looking skin. He also says that tests paid for by patients show that the supplement improves bone density, cognitive function, cholesterol levels and control of blood sugar.\n\n\n\nThe Reneuve website says the product uses "" Nobel Prize-winning technology to supply immune-system enhancing and anti-aging enzymes to the body."" It also says that, thanks to Reneuve, ""aging is now a choice, not a fact."" Rasjesh Sharma, the chief scientific officer of Reneuve, declined to be interviewed but said in an e-mail that the supplement helps replace the telomerase that people make naturally until they turn 25.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line\n\n\n\nDr. Richard Cawthon, who studies the link between telomeres and disease at the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City, says he would love to take an anti-aging supplement, but he\'s not willing to part with several thousand dollars for TA-65. ""Even if I could afford it, it\'s still too early in the research,"" he says. The benefits for now are unclear, he adds, and there\'s still the possibility of undesirable side effects.\n\n\n\nAs for Reneuve, ""that\'s nonsense,"" says Peter Hornsby, professor of physiology at the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Any enzyme in the supplement would be quickly broken down in the digestive system, he says.\n\n\n\nResearch with mice suggests that telomerase is a double-edged enzyme. A study published in the journal Nature last month showed that activating telomerase seemed to reverse aging in decrepit mice that had been genetically engineered to lack a working version of the enzyme. But other studies have found that stimulating telomerase in mice raises the risk of cancer. (Patton says that, to his knowledge, no one has developed cancer while taking TA-65.)\n\n\n\nSo far, TA-65 has been tested in just one published study (which is still one more than Reneuve). This year, Geron Corp. researchers reported in the journal Rejuvenation Research that TA-65 boosted the activity of telomerase in 114 people who took the supplement for a year. The supplements also seemed to lengthen the telomeres of some immune system cells.\n\n\n\nStill, Hornsby points out that a single study in a not-especially-prestigious journal doesn\'t come close to answering all of the questions about the anti-aging potential of TA-65. He says scientists aren\'t even sure that short telomeres contribute to the classic signs of growing old. They could just be byproducts of aging, not the driving force.\n\n\n\nHornsby sees another issue: If TA-65 is really tinkering with people\'s chromosomes, it should be classified as a drug. As it is, the supplement has never gone through any of the testing or Food and Drug Administration oversight required of prescription drugs.\n\n\n\nCurious about a consumer health product?

The additional benefit in terms of body composition came as a surprise for the research team.\n\n""We were very intrigued by the higher lean mass, the possibility that vitamin D can help infants to not only grow healthy skeletons but also healthy amounts of muscle and less fat,"" said Hope Weiler, one of the study\'s authors and Director of the Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at McGill University.\n\nFor the first time, a connection was made between the benefits of achieving healthy vitamin D status during a baby\'s first 12 to 36 months and how muscle mass develops. The researchers achieved this by following up on a 2013 study in which 132 infants in Montréal, Québec, were given a vitamin D3 supplement at one of four different dosages between the ages of 1 month and 12 months.\n\nThe new study confirmed the importance for the development of strong bones of a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU/day during a baby\'s first year. This amount is in line with current Canadian health guidelines. The researchers found that higher doses did not provide any additional benefit -- at least not in terms of bone development.\n\nBut the body scans used to assess bone density also allowed the team to measure the children\'s muscle and fat mass. While there were no significant differences in body composition across the different dosage groups, the researchers found children who had vitamin D stores above the threshold recommended by the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) averaged around 450 grams less body fat at 3 years of age.\n\nSupplements important in long winters\n\nVitamin D supplementation is routinely recommended for babies until they can get an adequate amount through their diet. The skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, making supplementation all the more important where long winters reduce the opportunity for this to happen. In addition, Health Canada advises parents and caregivers to avoid direct sunlight and avoid use of sun block creams in young infants.\n\nPhysical activity also reduces body fat\n\nFurther analysis also indicated a correlation between lean muscle mass and the average level of vitamin D in the body over the first three years of a child\'s life. The only other factor found to make a significant difference to the children\'s amount of body fat was their level of physical activity.\n\n###\n\n""Vitamin D supplementation trial in infancy: body composition effects at 3years of age in a prospective follow-up study from Montréal"", by T.

Weiler, Pediatric Obesity doi:10.1111/ijpo.12105']",This news release goes too far in implying that vitamin D supplementation leads to improved body composition in young children.,"This release summarizes an unexpected finding observed during follow-up of a study that looked at the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation on bone density in young children. The release claims in one section that at 3 years old, children that had been given vitamin D supplementation in infancy (during the ages of 1 month to 12 months old) appear to have reduced body fat and improved muscle mass. In another section, the release states “there were no significant differences in body composition across the different dosage groups” (the children were given either 400, 800, 1200 or 1600 IU/day). The journal article on which the release is based also states that there were no differences in body (muscle) mass between the groups of children given different doses of vitamin D.  The headline and some of the content appear to be discordant with the main findings — that higher vitamin D stores among those given supplements were associated with “around 450 grams less body fat at 3 years of age.” The release also omits cost, harms and funding sources.

This story is about a study of a new test for pancreatic cancer. It covered a lot of ground in a short space. It included many voices and a lot of good background about pancreatic cancer. It missed some big areas, though, including the potential costs of the tests and treatments for the disease, the quantification of the benefits, and any explanation of harms that would come from widespread screening for pancreatic cancer.

REUTERS/Nacho Doce\n\nAnd they may also help identify early signs of the disease in healthy people, the team reported in the Archives of Neurology.\n\n“The unexpected presence of the Alzheimer’s disease signature in more than one-third of cognitively normal subjects suggests that Alzheimer’s disease pathology is active and detectable earlier than has heretofore been envisioned,” Geert De Meyer of Ghent University in Belgium and colleagues wrote.\n\nThey said measuring traces of beta amyloid and tau — two proteins associated with the telltale plaques and tangles that form in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s — accurately detected Alzheimer’s in 90 percent of patients with the disease.\n\nThey were also able to detect 100 percent of people with memory impairments who would progress to Alzheimer’s disease within five years. And they detected Alzheimer’s proteins in 36 percent of people with normal brain function.\n\nThe study is the latest to show that measuring disease-related proteins in spinal fluid is useful in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nCurrently, only an autopsy can confirm that a person has Alzheimer’s, a fatal and incurable deterioration of the brain that affects more than 26 million people globally.\n\nDoctors diagnose Alzheimer’s by excluding other causes of memory loss, such as stroke, tumors and heavy drinking. They can also administer simple paper-and-pencil tests.\n\nBut biomarkers — proteins and imaging techniques — are helping to identify the disease much earlier.\n\nLast month, experts at the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association proposed new guidelines for diagnosing Alzheimer’s even before patients have symptoms. [ID:nN13273900] These proposed rules included measurements of cerebral-spinal fluid.\n\nIn the study, De Meyer and colleagues analyzed spinal fluid from 114 adults with normal brain function, 200 who had mild cognitive impairment — a precursor to dementia — and 102 who had Alzheimer’s. They identified one protein signature that was associated with Alzheimer’s, and another that indicated healthy brain function.\n\nWhen they looked to see how accurate these signatures were at spotting the disease, they found 90 percent of those with Alzheimer’s had the disease pattern in their spinal fluid. The pattern was present in 72 percent of those with mild cognitive impairment and 36 percent of those who were normal.""]","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">This story is by far the briefest of the three we reviewed on the topic of a spinal fluid test for Alzheimer’s Disease.

While the headline and the lead sentence emphasize the potential usefulness of spinal fluid testing for confirmation of Alzheimer’s Disease diagnoses, the story incorrectly states that the test predicted disease progression. It says the test was ""able to detect 100 percent of people with memory impairments who would progress to Alzheimer’s disease within five years."" But rather than predicting the future, what the researchers actually reported was that looking backwards they found that the participants who developed Alzheimer’s during the study period all had the pattern of biomarkers linked to the disease. That distinction is important, as demonstrated by the fact that less than half of the study participants who already had memory problems and had a biomarker pattern linked to Alzheimer’s actually progressed during the course of the study.

Part of the group was given gemcitabine, the most favored treatment according to oncologists. The other patients were given a combination of four chemotherapy drugs, (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin) known as FOLFIRINOX. The treatments lasted for six months. The purpose of the study was to record the overall survival rates of each group.\n\nResearchers found that even though people on the FOLFIRINOX had a longer average survival rate of 11.1 months, versus the gemcitabine group with 6.8 months, the quality of life for patients on FOLFIRINOX was not as good.

The study results published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.\n\nThe study analyzed 375 patients ages 50 or older who were randomly assigned to three groups, either receiving OMT, a light touch or conventional care only. Differences between treatment groups were evaluated for subgroups of participants based on their age, Pneumonia Severity Index and type of pneumonia. The data were analyzed by intention-to-treat analysis of all participants and by per-protocol analysis of participants who finished the study without missing any protocol treatments.\n\nKey findings by per-protocol analysis of the younger subgroup found that OMT decreased hospital stay by 1.1 days compared to those who received conventional care only. By intention-to-treat analysis of the older subgroup, in-hospital mortality rates were 11 percent lower to the conventional-care only group. OMT also reduced the in-hospital mortality rates of those with the highest severity of illness.\n\n""Osteopathic manipulative therapy was developed in the pre-antibiotic era specifically for the management of pneumonia. While antibiotic therapy is the current standard of care, the emergence of resistant bacteria is a global threat and provides an incentive to explore adjunct treatments that can improve their efficacy,"" said James Bailey, DO, assistant professor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine. ""This study should encourage physicians to use their osteopathic techniques when treating older patients with pneumonia.""\n\nPneumonia is a leading cause of death for elderly patients, with over 90 percent of pneumonia-related deaths among those 65 and older. Previous studies have also shown that OMT can improve the efficacy of antibiotics in pneumonia patients.\n\nOsteopathic manipulative techniques can help treat structural and tissue abnormalities, relieve joint restriction and misalignment, restore muscle and tissue balance and promote the overall movement blood flow throughout the body. When appropriate, it can complement, and in some cases replace, medications or surgery.\n\n###\n\nDisclosures: The basis for this analysis, The Multicenter Osteopathic Pneumonia Study in the Elderly (MOPSE) clinical trial, was funded by a consortium of foundations including the Foundation for Osteopathic Health Services.

Edited by Robert Orenstein, DO, it is the premier scholarly peer-reviewed publication of the osteopathic medical profession. The JAOA\'s mission is to advance medicine through the publication of peer-reviewed osteopathic research.']","A new sub-analysis of results from a previously published trial reported some benefit from osteopathic manipulation in elderly patients, but this release didn’t do justice to the study authors’ own acknowledgments of their trial’s limitations.","This news release issued by the American Osteopathic Association describes a relatively rigorous randomized controlled trial that compared the impact of osteopathic manipulation, light touch massage and standard antibiotic and mobilization treatment on pneumonia outcomes in some older, hospitalized patients. The outcomes measured — length of stay and overall deaths — showed statistically significant lower rates in both measures for subsets of 375 patients who participated in the study, and the study protocols incorporated two separate, accepted and complementary means of sorting out such factors as severity of illness and treatment compliance that make a reasonable case for comparable study groups.
That said, the release did not do justice to the study author’s own acknowledgments of their research’s limitations or weaknesses. Nor did it reflect the investigators’ reasoned call for further research to better pin down demonstrated benefits from osteopathic manipulation.  In this way, the release and the AOA missed a very good opportunity to address a) the widespread skepticism that greets much osteopathic medicine and research; and b) questions among the public and professionals about how and why adjunctive medical practices work, and under what conditions they should be used to treat patients. Instead, the release treats the potential benefits as a proven done deal. Those who take the time (and have the capacity) to examine the complicated graphic chart that accompanies the release might get more out of the release, but it’s unlikely that many of the intended audiences for the release will plow through it.
The new report is essentially several subgroup analyses but the release doesn’t mention the existence of the earlier study that reported the primary outcomes. This is a theme we’ve seen in other news releases such as here and here.

Zeitzer\'s latest study, published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , could make treatment easier by providing light exposure during sleep, before the trip, without changing or interrupting your routine.\n\nExploiting biology \'in the eye\'\n\nResearchers believe the flashing light helps reset the circadian system , which regulates rhythms in the human body and establishes normal sleep and wake phases.\n\nThe circadian system is synchronized to the outside world through exposure to light; it controls sleep timing, hormone release and mood, said Zeitzer, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Jet lag occurs when sleeping and waking patterns are not synchronized to circadian rhythms.\n\nTo adapt to a new time zone, most people try to get as much light exposure as possible corresponding to their destination, either by waking up early before a trip or staying up late when they arrive, Zeitzer said. Or they do nothing and suffer the exhausting consequences; the body eventually adjusts at a slow pace of about one hour a day, taking up to three days to catch up.\n\nThrough light therapy, the technique Zeitzer is experimenting with, a person\'s brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone. The treatment ""exploits biology in the eye"" to speed up the brain\'s adjustment to time changes, he said.\n\nThis study builds on previous research published in 2014, which found that light therapy works best at night because the body\'s circadian rhythms are more sensitive to light at night, even through closed eyelids. In this latest study, Zeitzer and Raymond Najjar, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford now at Singapore Eye Research Institute, found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip.\n\n""The previous study was proof of principle: Can we elicit these kinds of changes and can we do it without interfering with sleep?"" Zeitzer said. This time around, researchers tried to further optimize the process.\n\nContinuous light vs. flashes\n\nTo determine which would provide the fastest method of adjusting sleep cycles, researchers recruited 39 participants ages 19 to 36. They put them on a routine sleep-wake cycle, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day for about two weeks. They then had the volunteers sleep in the lab, where some were exposed to continuous light for an hour and others were exposed to a sequence of flashes of various frequencies for an hour.\n\nThey found that exposing people to two millisecond flashes of light, similar to a camera flash, every 10 seconds elicited two hours of change in circadian timing, compared with 36 minutes for those exposed to continuous light. Participants were able to sleep through the flashes of light without waking.\n\n""You get more effectiveness out of flashes of light. It will enable us to have more potent countermeasures to jet lag than continuous light, which is the current prescribed light therapy treatment,"" Zeitzer said.\n\nThe treatment could benefit not only travelers but also overnight shift workers and people with constantly changing schedules, he said, but that\'s a long way off. There\'s still more testing to be done before the technique is available to the public.']",This single-source article on jet lag research needed some outside perspective.,"This CNN story reports on a study of flashing light therapy as a method to improve the body’s ability to respond to jet lag. While it was an admittedly brief study with few participants, there was sufficient detail to suggest that the flashing light might be more beneficial compared to continuous light as a countermeasure for jet lag. But the story doesn’t do much to evaluate the qualify of evidence on offer here. Including at least one outside expert as a source, as a competing Reuters story did, and mention of other techniques that have undergone research to counter jet lag (melatonin, caffeine), would have been helpful.

Botulinum toxin type A is sold under different brands, but it’s best known by the Allergan brand-name Botox.\n\nA sample of Botox is seen at the Long Island Plastic Surgical Group at the Americana Manhasset luxury shopping destination in Manhasset, New York September 30, 2010. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nBotox gained fame for smoothing aging skin — by blocking nerve signals and relaxing muscles under the skin — but the product has a number of medical uses. In the U.S., Botox is approved to treat conditions like chronic migraine, excessive sweating and certain symptoms of MS: overactive bladder and muscles spasms in the arms.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Neurology, tested the effects of Botox injections on MS-related arm tremors, which affect up to two-thirds of people with MS. Researchers found that when they gave injections to 23 patients, the treatment typically eased their tremors and improved their writing ability.\n\nRight now, there’s no good way to treat MS arm tremors, said Nicholas G. LaRocca, vice-president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society. Physical therapy and exercise have been studied, but are usually not very effective, said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Surgery is sometimes used in severe cases, but it’s risky and may not even have lasting benefits.\n\n“Exploring new treatments is important, and it’s heartening to see there’s some promise here,” LaRocca said of the current findings. But there’s still a lot to be learned, he cautioned in an interview.\n\n“This study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,” LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.\n\nThe study’s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. “There are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,” Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email.\n\nOne is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months.\n\nIn real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks.\n\nMuscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself.\n\nThe study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Each patient received a round of Botox injections and a round of placebo injections (containing saline), three months apart. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo.\n\nOn average, the patients’ tremor “scores” had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment — which essentially means moving from “moderate” to “mild,” LaRocca said. Their ability to write and draw a straight line had also improved by week six, and the benefits were still there at week 12.\n\nIn contrast, there were no improvements after the placebo injections.\n\nLarger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others. Tremors limited to the hand and forearm, for instance, might respond better than tremors that also affect the shoulder. If Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections — since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle.\n\n“So practitioners will have to be up to speed,” LaRocca said. There will also be the matter of cost. That will vary from patient to patient, depending on how many injections are needed per treatment.\n\nAccording to van der Walt, the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. In the U.S., Botox treatments can cost $455-$575 per injection site.\n\nBotox maker Allergan supplied the product for the study, and two of the researchers on the work have financial ties to the company.

The findings may reduce the number of unnecessary treatments prescribed to otherwise healthy girls.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting up to 12% of women. Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from irregular periods, have excessive levels of male hormones and may have difficulty in conceiving due to irregularities in the ovaries. Doctors are cautious when diagnosing PCOS in teenagers because the symptoms can be confused with normal pubertal changes. Having tools that make diagnoses more accurate can reduce unnecessary treatment for otherwise healthy teenagers at a critical stage in their lives.\n\nThe cause of PCOS is unknown and there is currently no cure for the condition. Previous studies have associated high levels of irisin, a newly discovered hormone which is released from muscles and regulates energy metabolism, with PCOS in adults.\n\nIn this study, Greek researchers from Aghia Sophia Children\'s Hospital in Athens compared the hormones of 23 teenagers with PCOS with 17 healthy teenagers of the same age and BMI. They found that teenagers with PCOS had significantly higher irisin levels compared to the control group, and that this was associated with higher levels of the male sex hormone testosterone, a key marker of PCOS.\n\nThe findings suggest that irisin could be a marker for PCOS allowing the condition to be diagnosed more easily. ""Teenagers who get an early diagnosis of PCOS can sooner start to deal with the physical and psychological symptoms caused by this lifelong condition,"" said lead researcher Dr Flora Bacopoulou. ""Whether it\'s through counselling or medication, girls can manage their symptoms and decrease the risk of further complications such as fertility problems, hirsutism (excessive hair growth) and type-2 diabetes"".\n\nThe group will next focus on confirming their results and investigate the biological role of irisin in PCOS. ""If high irisin levels in teenagers with PCOS is established, this could lead to the development of treatments for PCOS. Lifestyle changes and different exercise-related signals that regulate the secretion of irisin could provide a potential option for the management of PCOS. The potential of irisin as a meaningful drug target in PCOS is very promising,"" said Dr Bacopoulou.\n\n###']",It’s still speculative that altering irisin hormone levels could lead to a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in teen girls.,"The release focuses on a study that found elevated levels of the hormone irisin in healthy teenage girls who have been diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). While the release stresses that these findings are preliminary, and need to be confirmed through additional research, it suggests that testing irisin levels may be a way of determining whether teenagers have PCOS. This, in turn, would both allow for early treatment of PCOS symptoms in girls who have the condition, and limit misdiagnoses (and related treatment) of PCOS in girls who do not have the syndrome.
But the detection of an association between elevated irisin level and PCOS is the first of the many steps needed to determine whether testing irisin has greater diagnostic accuracy than current tests for the condition. Even more speculative is the notion that a treatment for PCOS could be targeted to altering irisin levels. The release overstates the significance of this small, preliminary study.

Overuse of drugs also contributes to antibiotic resistance, so careful selection of who should take antibiotics is necessary according to 2 studies published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAccording to one of the studies, ear infection, or acute otitis media, is the most frequently diagnosed illness in children in the United States, and most children with these ear infections are routinely given antibiotics.\n\nBut just 2 months ago, a new study confirmed practice guidelines from 2004, which recommend that children older than 2 with a confirmed diagnosis of an acute ear infection do not need to be given antibiotics because the drugs do not significantly speed up recovery.\n\nThe foundation for the ""watchful waiting"" treatment recommendation instead of taking drugs is based on this and previous studies that did not have very many children under age 2 in the clinical trials. This made concluding that the same treatment works in the youngest age group very difficult.\n\nThese 2 new studies were designed to provide the research to fill the gap, and clarify treatment recommendations for babies and toddlers. The children in these latest trials had their ear infections confirmed by experts (otoscopists). Researchers found that the youngsters who received a placebo did not recover as quickly as those getting the amoxicillin-clavulanate, an antibiotic that has been shown to be effective for earaches.\n\nHowever the differences were not huge. In the United States study, 80% of the children on antibiotics felt better on the seventh day of treatment; 74% of the children taking a placebo also felt better on the seventh day.\n\nDr. Jerome Klein, a pediatric infectious disease specialist from Boston University\'s Medical School, says in an accompanying editorial that these two studies resolve the controversy over giving antibiotics versus watchful waiting in kids with confirmed ear infections.\n\n""More young children with a certain diagnosis of acute otitis media recover more quickly when they are treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent,"" Klein wrote.\n\nDr. Richard Rosenfeld, who is a professor and chairman of otolaryngology at SUNY Downstate and Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, has been charged with reviewing the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for treating ear infections. He, too, has been eagerly awaiting the results of these 2 studies.\n\nOne of the strengths of both studies, Rosenfeld said, is that the researchers took the time to make a solid diagnosis. Only children who really had ear infections were included in the trials. But Rosenfeld doesn\'t see the results as black and white as Klein.\n\n""Medicine is about gray zones and balancing the risks and benefits,"" Rosenfeld says. ""Parents and doctors need to understand what the benefits and what the downside of treatments are.""\n\n""If you received a placebo and you have a 74% chance of having symptoms go away or improvement [of illness]"" – compared with the 80% in the antibiotic group ... ""as a parent, how impressed are you about a 6% difference?"" In treatment outcomes for pain, there was no difference, he notes.\n\nIn both studies, children taking the real drugs had more side effects. The study authors caution about the overuse of these drugs and the risk of antibiotic resistance. The Finnish noted that limiting use of antibiotics may reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and increase the chance the future use of antibiotic will be effective.\n\nRosenfeld says it\'s never wrong to prescribe an antibiotic for a well-diagnosed ear infection. ""If the child has high fever, severe ear pain, the child is really miserable, has a fever or draining from the ear or double ear infection and is under 2 years old, then prescribing antibiotic is probably the right thing to do.""\n\nBut waiting to take the antibiotic isn\'t a bad idea either. He says he frequently writes a prescription for parents but tells them to hold off from filling it for 3 days.

Liggett, professor of medicine and physiology and director of the university\'s cardiopulmonary genomics program, in a university news release.\n\nThe receptors in the lungs -- which the team found by accident in an unrelated study -- are the same as those on the tongue. But the tongue\'s receptors are clustered in taste buds that send signals to the brain, while the receptors in the lungs are not grouped in buds and don\'t send signals to the brain, explained the research team. However, they still respond to bitter tastes.\n\nThe researchers tested different bitter compounds on human and mouse airways, individual airway smooth muscle cells, and on mice with asthma. They found that these compounds all opened lung airways more profoundly than current drugs.\n\nThe study appears online Oct. 24 in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\n""New drugs to treat asthma, emphysema or chronic bronchitis are needed. This could replace or enhance what is now in use, and represents a completely new approach,"" said Liggett.\n\nBut, he added, simply eating bitter-tasting foods or compounds won\'t help people with asthma.\n\n""Based on our research, we think that the best drugs would be chemical modifications of bitter compounds, which would be aerosolized and then inhaled into the lungs with an inhaler,"" he said.\n\nThe research, which is preliminary, was supported by grants from the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more about asthma.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story appears to be nothing more than a rewrite </span>","At least the University that issued the news release must be happy.

There have been two clinical studies showing positive safety and effectiveness of the device in the increase of tear production completed with 145 aqueous deficient dry eye adult patients.\n\n""TrueTear™ represents a technological breakthrough for eye care professionals as it delivers an effective, non-invasive and drug-free way to temporarily increase tear production,"" said David Nicholson, Chief R&D Officer, at Allergan. ""As an innovator in eye care, we are continually looking for new products to offer through our portfolio, and TrueTear™ represents the next step forward.""\n\nThe new advancement is an addition to Allergan\'s current eye care portfolio. Last May, Allergan announced positive results from two pivotal trials for TrueTear™ that showed an increase in tear production upon nasal neurostimulation in adults with aqueous tear deficiency.\n\n""In clinical trials, TrueTear™ demonstrated increased tear production upon stimulation of the nasal cavity,"" said John Sheppard, M.D., M.M. Sc., professor of Ophthalmology, Eastern Virginia Medical School and president of Virginia Eye Consultants.

It says primary endpoints were met, without explaining precisely what those endpoints were. It reports the total number of patients in two trials (145), but not how many were in each one or whether any dropped out or had unsatisfactory results. It does not mention that one trial involved just a one-day test in which some patients compared the device to a sham device.

Seciera™ is a patented, novel, proprietary nanomicellar formulation of cyclosporine A 0.09%. It is a clear, preservative-free, aqueous solution. Seciera™ is being developed by Ocular Technologies, a company recently acquired by Sun Pharma. Following this acquisition, Sun Pharma owns exclusive, worldwide rights to Seciera™ and is developing it to commercialize for global markets including US, Europe, and Japan, as well as several emerging markets.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160711/813488 )\n\n\n\nIn this 12 week, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled Phase 3 confirmatory study, 744 dry eye patients were treated either with Seciera™, or its vehicle. After 12 weeks of treatment, as compared to vehicle, Seciera™ showed statistically significant improvement in the primary end point, Schirmer\'s score (a measurement of tear production) (p<0.0001). The demonstration of efficacy by Seciera™ at 12 weeks is earlier than other drugs approved for dry eye in the same class.[1] Additionally, several key secondary endpoints showed statistically significant improvements compared to vehicle with some showing an even earlier onset of action. Adverse events reported in the trial were mild to moderate in nature and similar to other approved drugs in the category.[1]-[3] As Sun continues to analyze the data, additional significant findings will be shared at upcoming medical conferences.\n\nPreviously, in a completed Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in 455 patients, Seciera™ demonstrated a rapid onset of action and was well tolerated by the study population. Based on published data, the efficacy and safety endpoints in these trials compared favorably to other formulations of cyclosporine A with the advantage of early onset.[1]\n\nAccording to Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director, Sun Pharma, ""We are happy to see the early onset of action and strong efficacy results for Seciera™. These results are highly encouraging for millions of Dry Eye patients[4]-[6] across the globe that have yet to find relief for their condition. We look forward to discussing these results with US FDA and agree on next steps for the program.""\n\n""I am very excited to see these strong results for Seciera™,"" noted Dr. Joseph Tauber, Study Investigator and founder of the Tauber Eye Center, Kansas City, Missouri. ""As a clinician who specializes in diagnosing and treating dry eye, this novel formulation of cyclosporine A would be a unique and welcome addition to our armamentarium to treat these patients"".\n\nJerry St. Peter, Vice President and Head of Sun Ophthalmics, added: ""A key strategic imperative for our ophthalmic business is to participate in the rapidly growing, underserved, and dynamic Dry Eye market, which is expected to reach $5 billion by 2020.[7] Based on this successful confirmatory Phase 3 trial, Seciera™ has the potential to strengthen our emerging ophthalmics pipeline, which includes the recent launch of BromSite™ and late stage development programs for Xelpros™ and DexaSite™.""\n\nReferences :\n\nSall K, Stevenson OD, Mundorf TK, Reis BL.

Some European hospitals already rely on the method, called cell-free fetal DNA, although it’s not available from doctors in the U.S.\n\n“What they are finding in England is that many women are not going on to have the invasive tests,” Bianchi told Reuters Health.\n\nIn those procedures, doctors either extract a small amount of the fluid that surrounds the fetus (amniocentesis) or they take a sample of the placenta (chorionic villus sampling). Between one in 100 and one in 600 mothers miscarry as a result, according to Bianchi.\n\nIn a fresh look at the medical evidence for the blood test, she and her colleagues analyzed 57 earlier studies that included more than 6,500 pregnancies.\n\nThey found parents could trust the test 98.8 percent of the time when it said they’d have a boy, and 94.8 percent of the time when it indicated a girl.\n\nThat leaves some room for error, which could be important if parents are making medical decisions based on the results — such as whether or not to get an invasive procedure to look for genetic disorders.\n\nHowever, the current non-invasive alternative — an ultrasound done at the end of the first trimester — isn’t always good at spotting a baby’s sex, Bianchi’s team reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nAnd the blood test is reliable as early as seven weeks into the pregnancy, whereas ultrasound is not.\n\nBianchi said one study had estimated the blood test costs about 255 pounds in the UK (about $413), all included. While it’s available over the Internet, she said her team had only looked at hospital-based test performance.\n\n“I don’t know why it is not being incorporated in the US,” she said.\n\nRosser, however, chalked that up to the ethical issues it raises.\n\n“It is a great test that can be part of our armamentarium of noninvasive testing that we use,” she said. “But it should only be used by families that are at risk for sex-linked diseases.”\n\nBianchi said she owns stock in Verinata Health, a company that is developing cell-free fetal DNA tests for Down syndrome, although that company had no role in the new study.\n\nThe American College of Medical Genetics did not respond to requests for comment on the DNA tests.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/4HWZ7 Journal of the American Medical Association, August 10, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Both this story by Reuters and a <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=4194"" target=""_blank"">competing story by the New York Times</a> did a reasonable job in reporting on this research – and better than many others we saw but didn’t formally review. </span>","Reuters reports on a new survey, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which reinforces the accuracy of a certain blood test for determining the sex of a fetus as early as seven weeks along in pregnancy. We like how the Reuters story clearly discusses the numbers from the JAMA study, and points out that – while accurate – this kind of blood test could still lead to false information for some parents. But we find the New York Times story gives more consumer information for US audiences, explaining that “the tests have been available to consumers in drugstores and online for a few years.”

Despite the epidemic, opioid analgesics remain a first-line treatment for moderate to severe acute pain in the emergency department. The combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen may represent an effective non-opioid alternative.\n\nWho: 416 patients (ages 21 to 64 years) with moderate to severe acute extremity pain in two urban emergency departments were randomly assigned to receive\n\n400 mg ibuprofen and 1,000 mg acetaminophen\n\n5 mg oxycodone and 325 mg acetaminophen\n\n5 mg hydrocodone and 300 mg acetaminophen; or\n\n30 mg codeine and 300 mg acetaminophen\n\nWhen: July 2015 to August 2016\n\nWhat (Study Measures): The between-group difference in decline in pain two hours after taking the study drugs.\n\nHow (Study Design): This was a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Randomized trials allow for the strongest inferences to be made about the true effect of an intervention such as a medication or a procedure. However, not all RCT results can be replicated because patient characteristics or other variables in real-world settings may differ from those that were studied in the RCT.\n\nAuthors: Andrew K. Chang, M.D., M.S., of Albany Medical College, Albany, New York, and coauthors\n\nResults: After 2 hours pain was less in all participants, without any important difference in effect between the four groups.\n\nStudy Limitations: The results apply only to pain after two hours. About 1 in 5 patients required additional medication to control their pain.\n\nStudy Conclusions: There were no important differences in pain reduction after 2 hours with ibuprofen-acetaminophen or opioid-acetaminophen combination pills in emergency department patients with acute extremity pain. The findings suggest that ibuprofen-acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative to opioid management of acute extremity pain due to sprain, strain, or fracture, but further research to assess longer-term effect, adverse events and dosing is warranted.\n\nRelated material:\n\nThe following related elements also are available on the For The Media website:\n\nThe editorial, ""Opioid vs Nonopioid Acute Pain Management in the Emergency Department,"" by Demetrios N.

One of the painkillers was a combination of the over-the-counter medications acetaminophen and ibuprofen; the other three painkillers were combinations of acetaminophen and an opioid (oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine). The study found that — within the two-hour window being evaluated — there was no statistical significant difference in the effectiveness of the four drugs, indicating that acetaminophen/ibuprofen is a viable alternative to opioids for addressing acute pain. The release does a good job of describing the study and placing it in the context of the “opioid crisis” in the U.S. However, the release does not address cost or potential harms, and does not make clear how this study builds on or differs from previous research on how non-opioid painkillers differ from opioid painkillers.

REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nIn a study published in the journal Nature, scientists from the British drugmaker collaborating with the charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Cellzome AG found that the experimental drug, called I-BET151, mimics a chemical tag which is key to preventing the process of activating the leukemia genes.\n\n“This ... is an exciting new avenue for drug discovery which we hope will be useful for other types of cancer in addition to MLL-leukaemias,” said Tony Kouzarides of the Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute at Cambridge University, who co-led the study.\n\nKevin Lee, head of epigenetics discovery research at GSK, who also worked on the study, said he too was excited about the findings, although it will probably be many years before the drug could potentially reach the market.\n\n“Even though this is still lab-based ... it validates the idea of developing small molecules against epigenetic switches,” he said in an emailed comment.\n\n“It is important to remember we will need to be successful on a number of additional steps before we can move this from the lab to testing this compound in humans.”\n\nMLL leukemia is thought to account for up to 80 percent of cases of acute leukemia in children below two years old, and up to one in 10 cases in adults.\n\nMost patients don’t respond well to standard leukemia treatments and often the cancer comes back.\n\nThe disease is caused when a gene called MLL gets fused to another gene. This disrupts the normal function of MLL by creating a new “fusion protein” that behaves wrongly, switching on genes that drive the development of leukemia.\n\nKouzarides’s team found that in the disease, the MLL-fusion proteins are targeted to leukemia-causing genes by proteins from the BET family, which recognize certain chemical “tags” on chromatin, the scaffold on which DNA is arranged.\n\nUsing I-BET151 to treat leukaemias in mice and human cancer cells in a lab, the researchers found that the chemical could halt the disease, paving the way for more research to be done in first-stage, or so-called Phase I, human trials.\n\n“We urgently need better ways to treat children with more aggressive forms of leukemia, such as MLL,” said Lesley Walker, CRUK’s director of information.\n\n“Although this research is only in the lab at the moment, we hope it will move quickly toward clinical trials in patients.”\n\nLeukemia is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children and accounts for a around a third of all cancers diagnosed in children.

Previous research has found that one out of every four women with fibroids has problems related to fertility. The standard treatment option for such women is myomectomy, or surgical removal of the fibroids.\n\nHowever, myomectomy is not always possible or effective and can result in major complications including hysterectomy, according to study co-author João Martins Pisco, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Interventional Radiology at Saint Louis Hospital in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nUterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is a less invasive option that involves injection of an embolic agent, typically made up of very small beads, into the uterine arteries to block the blood supply to the uterus and fibroids. As the fibroids die and begin to shrink, the uterus fully recovers. UFE can be performed in patients with a prior myomectomy or in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nDespite its less invasive nature, UFE has yet to be fully embraced in the medical community as a fertility-preserving treatment for women with symptomatic fibroids due to concerns that the procedure may cause inadequate blood flow to the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, and the ovaries.\n\nFor the new study, Dr. Pisco and colleagues assessed pregnancy rates in 359 women with uterine fibroids who were unable to conceive and who underwent either conventional or partial UFE. In conventional UFE, all uterine artery branches are embolized. However, the partial procedure requires treatment of only the small vessels to the fibroids, leaving the corresponding larger vessels unaffected. Partial UFE may help reduce the risks of infertility associated with conventional UFE.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of almost six years, 149 of the 359 women, or 41.5 percent, had become pregnant one or more times, and 131 gave birth to a total of 150 babies. It was the first pregnancy for more than 85 percent of the women who gave birth.\n\nThe procedures had a clinical success rate of approximately 79 percent for fibroid-related symptoms. Complication rates were 14.6 percent for partial UFE and 23.1 percent for conventional UFE. The procedure was repeated in 28 patients whose fibroids had not been fully treated, as shown by MRI, and 11 of those patients subsequently got pregnant.\n\n""Our findings show that UFE is a fertility-restoring procedure in women with uterine fibroids who wish to conceive, and pregnancy following UFE appears to be safe with low morbidity,"" Dr. Pisco said. ""Women who had been unable to conceive had normal pregnancies after UFE and similar complication rates as the general population in spite of being in a high-risk group.""\n\nDr. Pisco suggested that UFE may become the first-line treatment for women with fibroids who wish to conceive, particularly for those with numerous or very large fibroids. Such patients have a fibroid recurrence rate of more than 60 percent after myomectomy, making UFE an important option.\n\nThe researchers are continuing the treatments and compiling data. Since the time of writing, there were 12 additional pregnancies.\n\n""In our study there are now almost 200 newborns following UFE,"" Dr. Pisco said. ""Our next step will be a randomized study comparing the results of partial and conventional UFE.""\n\n###\n\n""Spontaneous Pregnancy with a Live Birth after Conventional and Partial Uterine Fibroid Embolization.""

UFE involves injecting an agent into the uterine arteries to block the blood supply to the uterus and fibroids which causes the fibroids to shrink and die.
The research set out to determine whether either of two types of UFE — conventional and partial — is viable for treating uterine fibroids while preserving fertility. But the release suggests that all of the women who became pregnant after the procedure did so because the fibroids were treated. However, it’s unclear whether the fibroids caused infertility (they don’t always) or whether their removal made pregnancy possible. 
The release could have spelled out potential harms from the procedure a lot more clearly than it did.

Stephanie Yao, a spokeswoman at the F.D.A., wrote in an e-mail that any item that uses melatonin “as an additive may be subject to regulatory action.”\n\nThat is why the makers of these new baked goods label them “Not for food use.” They want them to be considered dietary supplements, which do not need the F.D.A.’s premarket approval and are not required to be proved safe or effective.\n\n“It sounds to me like they are trying to claim that the entire brownie is like a tablet, which is, of course, preposterous,” Dr. Czeisler said.\n\nTim Barham, the vice president of HBB, the maker of Lazy Cakes, said, “We look at the brownie as a supplement.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNews reports have classified Lazy Cakes as dietary supplements, but last month, Douglas Karas, an F.D.A. spokesman, said in an e-mail that the agency “has not made a determination on Lazy Cakes’ status as either a food or a dietary supplement.”\n\nIn January last year, the F.D.A. sent a warning letter to Peter Bianchi, the creator of Drank, a purple drink with 2 milligrams of melatonin in each can that went on the market in 2008, spawning several competitors.\n\nThe letter cited safety concerns about melatonin in food, specifically research indicating that melatonin reduced glucose tolerance for people with Type 1 diabetes and that some men using it had reported enlarged breasts. It also warned that women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should avoid melatonin “based on possible hormonal effects.” (Drank’s bottle now say it is a dietary supplement.)\n\nDr. Lewy dismissed the idea that harm might lurk in a melatonin-laced brownie. “It really doesn’t have any documented side effects except for making you sleepy at bedtime, which is good,” he said.

The researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach, along with same-day discharge, could save the United States $300 million per year.\n\n“We have unequivocal evidence and data that show better outcomes when we access the heart’s coronary arteries and perform angioplasty through a blood vessel in the wrist rather than through the femoral artery in the groin,” said first author Amit P. Amin, MD, an assistant professor of medicine. “The femoral artery is the traditional route, but when we go in through a vessel in the wrist, we see less bleeding, fewer complications, less pain and discomfort, higher patient satisfaction, shorter hospital stays, and lower costs.”\n\nPatients may undergo coronary angioplasty — also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — to alleviate chest pain or shortness of breath. Such symptoms suggest the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart are blocked or narrowed and oxygen delivery to the heart muscle is reduced. Interventional cardiologists insert a small tube into an artery in the wrist or the groin, which can be used to view the narrowed heart artery, deliver an inflatable balloon to open up the narrowed section, and possibly deliver a stent to hold the vessel open.\n\nUsing the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry, the researchers analyzed data from almost 280,000 Medicare patients who underwent PCI and were eligible for same-day discharge. Despite the fact that all of these patients were capable of leaving the hospital the same day as their procedures, only about 5 percent of these patients actually were discharged without having stayed overnight.\n\n“We have seen that it is very safe to send these patients home the same day,” said Amin, who treats patients at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. “We use risk-prediction models to predict their risks ahead of time, and we plan ahead to mitigate any issues so we can facilitate a same-day discharge. This is really about patient care. We want to outline health-care pathways that provide the best care for patients.”\n\nThe analysis demonstrated an average cost of $13,389 for the wrist approach with same-day discharge, compared with $17,076 for the groin approach with at least one night of hospitalization, resulting in a cost savings of about $3,700 for outpatients who get the wrist-access procedure. Independent of the length of stay, the wrist approach costs about $900 less than the groin approach, on average.\n\nThe investigators estimated that if a hospital performing 1,000 of these procedures annually shifted 30 percent of these patients to the wrist-access with same-day discharge approach, the hospital would save $1 million over that period. Expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the United States $300 million in health-care spending per year. Health-care costs for the 600,000 patients who receive PCI each year in the U.S. are estimated to be $10 billion.\n\nOf the study’s patient population receiving PCI, 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access. According to Amin, improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries, even for complex cases, and should be considered for more patients.\n\n“The traditional way has been to go through the bigger femoral artery that is a straight pathway to the heart,” Amin said. “Unfortunately, that artery is also deep. It’s associated with more bleeding complications. In contrast, the wrist artery is small and is associated with fewer complications. The minor challenge is in the difficulty of navigating a smaller, more twisting path of an artery through the wrist. But with advances we have in technology and equipment, those challenges are rapidly decreasing.”\n\n###\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from Vita Solutions, a subsidiary of The Medicines Company, for whom Amin has provided consultation; and by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers UL1TR000448, KL2TR000450, TL1TR000449 and 1KM1CA156708-01.

But a new study suggests these drugs may also help keep dementia at bay.\n\nThe researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That\'s true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn\'t normally be given blood thinners.\n\n""We found that people who are on warfarin -- the most common blood thinner used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation -- experienced very low rates of dementia, including Alzheimer\'s disease,"" said lead researcher Dr. T. Jared Bunch. He\'s director of heart rhythm research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Murray, Utah.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a common heart abnormality that affects nearly 3 million American adults. It causes the heart to beat abnormally or quiver. This causes blood to pool, and then it can clot.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can cause dementia by damaging tiny blood vessels in the brain through repeated tiny clots or small bleeds that people aren\'t even aware of, Bunch explained.\n\nWhile many patients are initially given aspirin, Bunch said aspirin\'s benefit in cutting the risk for dementia is limited, and patients should be started on warfarin or another blood thinner.\n\nAlthough the study looked at patients taking warfarin (Coumadin), newer drugs -- including rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis) -- should reduce the risk of dementia even more, Bunch said.\n\nIn patients with atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke is usually measured using the so-called CHADS score, the researchers said. This score assigns points for several risk factors, such as age, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and a previous stroke.\n\nA score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren\'t needed because the risk for stroke is low. For patients with scores above one, blood thinners are considered necessary, as these patients are judged to be at moderate to high risk, according to the researchers.\n\nIn this study, however, the investigators said they found that even a short delay in giving blood thinners to patients at low risk for stroke increases the risk for dementia.\n\nIn patients considered at low-risk for stroke, delaying blood-thinning treatment increased the risk for dementia 30 percent. In high-risk patients, a delay increased the risk 136 percent, the researchers reported.\n\nThe longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said.\n\nFor the study, Bunch and his colleagues looked at information from more than 76,000 atrial fibrillation patients who had no history of dementia. The average age of the study participants was 69, and 57 percent were male. The researchers looked at when treatment began: either within 30 days of atrial fibrillation diagnosis, which was considered immediate; or after a year, which was considered delayed.\n\n""Once you are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, starting stroke-prevention strategies immediately is essential. We shouldn\'t wait longer than a month to begin treatment,"" Bunch said. ""The delay in treating can be devastating to patients when they start developing mental decline years later,"" he added.\n\nThe results of the study were scheduled for presentation Friday at the meeting of the Heart Rhythm Society in Chicago. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they\'ve been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAccording to Dr. Byron Lee of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), ""There is a growing body of literature supporting the connection between atrial fibrillation and dementia."" Lee is a professor of medicine and director of the electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at UCSF.\n\n""Therefore,"" he said, ""we need to be extremely aggressive in treating atrial fibrillation patients with anticoagulants [blood thinners] when indicated. This study shows that treatment delays of even one month can greatly increase the incidence of cognitive [mental] decline,"" Lee said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on atrial fibrillation, visit the American Heart Association.']","The story reminds readers that the study conclusions are “preliminary,” an important cautionary note, but then leads with rather strong causal statement.","Abnormal heart rhythms, called atrial fibrillation, are associated with increased risk of stroke and, in recent years, have also been linked to dementia. Blood thinners have typically been prescribed for atrial fibrillation patients at higher risk of stroke, while those at lower risk are often told to take aspirin.
This study recommends that nearly all atrial fibrillation patients take blood thinners, however, as the analysis found that their use is associated with lower rates of dementia.
The story reminds readers that the study conclusions are “preliminary,” an important cautionary note, but then leads with rather strong causal statements and allows the study author to vigorously recommend blood thinners for all atrial fibrillation patients. That recommendation may eventually be warranted, but only time and additional research will tell.

Warfarin is notoriously tricky to modulate, however, and needs to be closely monitored -- usually through monthly doctors\' visits. If the drug\'s activity isn\'t checked regularly it can trigger severe bleeding episodes, the most serious of which can happen in the brain.\n\n""Warfarin is labor-intensive to manage,"" said study researcher Dr. Jack Ansell, chairman of the department of medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""Sometimes it impairs the patient\'s quality of life and the outcomes are very dependent on how well the drug dosing is managed,"" he added. ""This [new] drug has a lot of advantages over warfarin.""\n\nWith apixaban, patients can use a standard dose that doesn\'t need monitoring and adjusting, Ansell said. Also, unlike warfarin, apixaban has few interactions with other drugs or foods, he added.\n\nThe study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, the makers of apixaban.\n\nApixaban is a so-called Xa inhibitor, a class of anticoagulants (anti-clotting drugs) that work by blocking factor X, a protein involved in blood clotting. Ansell expects drugs in this class will have a major effect on how atrial fibrillation is managed in the future.\n\nAnother similar drug, Pradaxa (dabigatran), has been on the market for about a year and many patients with atrial fibrillation have been switched or started on it, he said.\n\n""Once [apixaban] is available it is going to be very difficult to avoid offering this drug to patients,"" he said.\n\nThe issue of cost remains a factor, however. While generic warfarin is just pennies a dose, any new brand-name drug is likely to be much more expensive. According to Laura Hortas, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb, because apixaban is still an experimental drug its price tag remains uncertain.\n\nThe new report was published online Aug. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with its presentation at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Paris.\n\nFor the trial, more than 18,000 patients with atrial fibrillation and a heightened risk for stroke were randomly assigned to receive either apixaban or warfarin.\n\nOver an average of 1.8 years of follow-up there were fewer strokes or clots among patients taking apixaban (1.27 percent a year), compared with patients taking warfarin (1.6 percent per year), the researchers found.\n\nThis means that apixaban prevented six patients from having a stroke, 15 patients from having a major bleeding event and eight patients from dying, the researchers said in a Duke University news release.\n\nThe major effect on stroke was preventing hemorrhagic stroke, which is caused by bleeding in the brain and is the most serious type of stroke. According to the researchers, apixaban reduced this risk by 50 percent, preventing four patients from having this type of stroke and two patients from having an ischemic stroke (cause by a vessel blockage) or stroke of uncertain origin.\n\nAs to apixaban\'s expected higher price tag, Ansell said that since the drug does not require monitoring and the incidence of stroke and major bleeding are less, savings in doctors\' visits and stroke treatment should more than compensate.\n\nThe new trial comes on the heels of another study on apixaban that was stopped early due to safety concerns. In that trial, published in July in the New England Journal of Medicine, apixaban\'s use was associated with raised odds for bleeding -- without providing patients with any reduction in heart attack risk.\n\nHowever, ""in that case, apixaban was given to patients with coronary artery disease who were also taking two other blood thinners,"" Ansell noted. ""The three of them together showed that the risk of bleeding was just too high and there was no real benefit in that population. But, that\'s an entirely different problem, compared with atrial fibrillation,"" he said.\n\nCommenting on the latest study, Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles agreed that ""atrial fibrillation substantially increases the risk of stroke and death.""\n\nWarfarin reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it also boosts the odds of bleeding and is often difficult to manage, he said.\n\n""Apixaban is now the first oral anticoagulant [blood thinner] to show a statistically significant improvement in survival over warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients,"" Fonarow said.

Merck is expected to announce late-stage trial results of a similar drug, boceprevir, this year. And numerous other companies, from pharmaceutical giants to small start-ups, are in hot pursuit.\n\nBoth Vertex’s telaprevir and Merck’s boceprevir block an enzyme known as protease that is made by the virus. Most of the other new drugs also work by blocking viral enzymes. This direct antiviral approach has been used with great success in treating H.I.V. and AIDS.\n\nVertex itself says it expects results from two additional Phase 3 trials of telaprevir in the third quarter and will then apply to the Food and Drug Administration for approval of the drug.\n\nSome 2.7 million to 3.9 million Americans are estimated to have hepatitis C, and 12,000 die from it each year, according to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine.\n\nThe disease can cause cirrhosis, which is a scarring of the liver, as well as liver cancer. The virus is transmitted by blood, so most people who have hepatitis C either have injected illegal drugs or received blood transfusions or blood products before the early 1990s.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It is not quite clear how those drugs work.\n\nFor patients with the type of hepatitis most prevalent in the United States, which is called Genotype 1, the treatment lasts nearly a year and can cause side effects that include flulike symptoms, anemia and depression. It is so arduous that many patients opt not to get treated or drop out before completing the course.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in Vertex’s trial, about 70 percent of those who achieved an effective cure were able to do so in 24 weeks, or about six months. That shorter time line, plus a higher chance of success, could entice more people to be treated, experts say.\n\n“If you can promise them six months with a reasonable chance of a cure, that’s a meaningful advance,” said Dr. Scott L. Friedman, chief of the division of liver diseases at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.\n\nIf approved, telaprevir would have to be used initially with the existing drugs to prevent the virus from evolving resistance. But experts hope that eventually several of the pills now in development could be used together, much as AIDS is treated, doing away with the need for interferon.\n\nVertex’s clinical trial enrolled 1,095 patients in the United States and abroad who had Genotype 1 hepatitis C and had not been treated previously. Patients got either 12 weeks or eight weeks of telaprevir or a placebo. The standard therapy of interferon and ribavirin was given for either 24 weeks or 48 weeks, depending on how the patients were faring after four weeks and 12 weeks.\n\nOf those who got 12 weeks of telaprevir, 75 percent had a sustained viral response, meaning the virus was not detectable in their blood 24 weeks after completing treatment. That is seen as essentially a cure. The rate was 69 percent for those who got eight weeks of telaprevir.\n\nThe drug can cause a nasty rash and increases the rate of anemia. About 7 percent of the patients getting telaprevir dropped out of the trial, about double the figure for the control group.\n\nLorren Sandt, chairwoman of the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, an advocacy group, called the trial results impressive. But she added, “The community hopes that if telaprevir is approved by the F.D.A. that it will be accessible and affordable to everyone.”\n\nVertex, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., has not said what it would charge. But analysts expect the drug to cost tens of thousands of dollars for a course of treatment.""]","Whether a business story with a stock market angle or a health section story with a clinical trial angle, some of the foundational bricks were missing from this piece – regardless its home. ","This is basically a stock market performance story dressed up as a clinical trial story, one of many such stories where someone on the business desk is asked to write about a ""breakthrough"" for the purposes of giving investors/readers some insight on where to make their next investment move. Because the reporter is well above average, the story is packed with information about the trial, about the drug, about hepatitis and about the company. But there is quite a bit of information missing that would be helpful for patients who, most likely, aren’t going to see perhaps unfounded hope in phrases such as, ""a new era in treating a sometimes fatal disease.""

You Might Want to Check Your Blood Pressure\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Rensten/Getty Images John Rensten/Getty Images\n\nEvery day, Dr. Walter Koroshetz, 65, takes a pill as part of his effort to help keep his brain healthy and sharp.\n\nThe pill is his blood pressure medication. And Koroshetz, who directs the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, says controlling high blood pressure helps him reduce his risk of dementia.\n\nHe also keeps his blood pressure down by exercising and paying attention to his weight and diet. ""I\'m a believer,"" he says.\n\nKoroshetz is urging other people with high blood pressure to follow his lead.\n\nHe is responsible for the institute\'s public health campaign called Mind Your Risks. Its goal is to let people know that there is a link between high blood pressure, stroke and dementia.\n\nWhen blood pressure rises, it strains the tiny blood vessels that keep brain cells alive, Koroshetz says.\n\n""With every pulse of your heart, you are pushing blood into these very small blood vessels in the brain,"" he says. And when the heart pushes too hard, as it does when blood pressure is elevated, it can cause damage that can lead to a stroke.\n\nAt least two large studies have revealed an alarming trend among stroke patients, Koroshetz says.\n\n""If you had a stroke, even a small stroke, your risk of dementia within the next two years was greatly magnified,"" he says. ""So there\'s something about having a stroke that drives a lot of the processes that give rise to dementia.""\n\nThe evidence is clearest for a type of dementia called vascular dementia. It occurs when something blocks or reduces the flow of blood to brain cells.\n\nBut high blood pressure also appears to increase a person\'s risk of developing Alzheimer\'s disease, which is associated with the accumulation of plaques and tangles in the brain.\n\nIf people knew about the link between dementia and high blood pressure, they might be more inclined to do something about it, Koroshetz says.\n\n""Only about 50 percent of people who have hypertension are actually treated,"" he says. ""So I think there\'s a lot to be said for trying to get high blood pressure under control.""\n\nKoroshetz\'s campaign is getting some help from the Alzheimer\'s Association.\n\nThe group will present new research on blood pressure and Alzheimer\'s at its annual scientific meeting in Chicago, which starts July 22. And the group is encouraging people to control high blood pressure.\n\n""The good news is that we can control blood pressure now,"" says Maria Carrillo, the group\'s chief science officer. ""We can do that with exercise, with lifestyle, with healthy eating and also with medications.""\n\nKoroshetz is using all of these approaches. And he says other people with high blood pressure should follow his lead.\n\n""When you get to be my age, you\'re going to be very grateful that you controlled your blood pressure and exercised,"" he says.']","The story may mislead people into thinking that if they pop a pressure pill each day, they will avoid Alzheimer’s Disease. That’s unproven.","This NPR report built around exhortations to control blood pressure by the head of a federal health agency draws attention to the long-documented links between hypertension and some forms of dementia.
For many, many reasons, diagnosing and treating high blood pressure are good ideas for maintaining health and preventing strokes and heart disease, and the better news is that there are dozens of drugs and lifestyle changes available — some of them very inexpensive — to help people do so.
But this story doesn’t explain that the evidence for an association between high blood pressure and vascular dementia, much less Alzheimer’s disease, is so far mostly observational. And perhaps more significantly, the story carries no data at all to support even the claims or strengths/weaknesses of the association.

Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals\' metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada.\n\nResearch has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestyle-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For this reason, dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity.\n\nThe research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. They exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. Their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise. Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet. Their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable. In a further experiment, similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting.\n\nThrough an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body\'s reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.\n\n""Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,"" says Kyoung-Han Kim.\n\n""Strikingly, these fasting-stimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24-hour fasting, and are completely reversed when mice start eating again,"" adds Yun Hye Kim.\n\n###\n\nReference: Kim, K-H. et al (2017).

These key questions aren’t addressed. Not is there a caution that mice studies are rarely replicated in human trials.,"This news release describes a study about intermittent fasting in mice, in which the mice that fasted weighed less four months later than the mice that did not fast. The finding described in the news release only applied to mice being fed a high fat diet (45 percent from fat), whereas when on normal chow and intermittent fasting on normal chow, there wasn’t much difference.
The release was short on numbers and descriptions of measurements used, and implied that the mouse studies could benefit people, without any caveats that such a transfer of mouse discovery to practical application in humans often fails.
The release did name the funders and avoided sensationalizing obesity.

It is believed that success rates could be hindered as a result of treating all prostate cancers in the same way.\n\nA team at the University of York and the University of British Columbia, Canada, however, have designed a test that can pick out life-threatening prostate cancers, with up to 92% accuracy.\n\nProfessor Norman Maitland, from the University of York\'s Department of Biology, said: ""Unnecessary prostate treatment has both physical consequences for patients and their families, but is also a substantial financial burden on the NHS, where each operation will cost around £10,000.\n\n""Cancers that are contained in the prostate, however, have the potential to be \'actively monitored\' which is not only cheaper, but has far fewer negative side-effects in patients with non-life threatening cancer.""\n\nIt is now understood that to find the different levels of cancer, scientists have to identify genes that have been altered in different cancer types. The team analysed more than 500 cancer tissue samples and compared them with non-cancer tissue to search for patterns of a chemical group that is added to part of the DNA molecule, altering gene expression.\n\nA person\'s age, what they eat and how they sleep, for example, impacts on chemical alterations to genes and which ones are turned on and off. This is part of the normal functioning of the human body and can tell individuals apart, but the process can sometimes go wrong, resulting in various diseases.\n\nProfessor Maitland said: ""In some diseases, such as cancer, genes can be switched to an opposite state, causing major health issues and threat to life.\n\n""The challenge in prostate cancer is how to look at all of these patterns within a cell, but hone in on the gene activity that suggests cancer, and not only this, what type of cancer - dangerous or manageable?\n\n""To put it another way: how to do we distinguish the tiger cancer cells from the pussycat cancer cells, when there are millions of patterns of chemical alterations going on, many of which will be perfectly healthy?""\n\nThe team needed to eliminate the \'noise\' of the genetic patterns that make individuals unique, to leave them with the patterns that indicate cancer. They were able to do this using a computer algorithm, which left the team with 17 possible genetic markers for prostate cancer.\n\nDr Davide Pellacani, who began these studies in York, before moving to the University of British Columbia, said: ""Using this computer analysis, not only could we see which tissue samples had cancer and which didn\'t, but also which cancers were dangerous and which ones less so.\n\n""Out of almost a million markers studied, we were able to use our new tools to single out differences in cancer potency.""\n\nTo take this method out of the laboratory, the team are now investigating a further trial with new cancer samples, and hope to involve a commercial partner to allow this to be used for patients being treated in the NHS.\n\n###\n\nThe research, published in the British Journal of Cancer, was funded by The Freemasons of the Province of Yorkshire (North and East Ridings) and The Masonic Samaritan Fund. Yorkshire Cancer Research; Prostate Cancer UK; The British Columbia Cancer Agency Strategic Priorities Fund.']","The test has only been performed in the laboratory, and is likely still years away from being available to actual patients.","A news release from the University of York describes a new test that uses computer algorithms and genetic markers to distinguish between aggressive and more manageable types of prostate cancer.

It is known as BMS-790052.\n\nBut the study provides the first clinical evidence that targeting the HCV protein NS5A may be an effective strategy for curing patients who are chronically infected with the HCV virus, says Nicholas A. Meanwell, PhD, who is executive director of chemistry with Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n\nChronic HCV infection is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure and is the leading reason for liver transplants in the U.S.\n\nThe current treatment for chronic HCV -- intravenously administered peg-interferon and ribavirin -- cures about half of people with genotype 1 who take it. But many patients find they cannot tolerate months of treatment with interferon, which can cause anemia and severe flu-like symptoms.\n\nCure rates are lower for people with HCV genotype 1, which includes about 70% of Americans chronically infected with hepatitis C virus; and they are lower still for people who do not respond well to initial treatment.\n\n""It is clear that other treatments are needed,"" Meanwell tells WebMD. ""What we are developing, and a lot of other companies too, are small molecule antiviral agents that specifically target the virus.""\n\nIn fact, no fewer than 90 studies are currently underway examining different HCV-targeting drugs. Two of these drugs, Vertex Pharmaceutical\'s telaprevir and Merck\'s boceprevir, are in the final stages of study and may make it to the market as early as next year.\n\nA unique thing about the NS5A-targeting drug, according to Meanwell, is that laboratory studies show it to be effective against all HCV genotypes.']",More focused and realistic in its assessment of a new study than the competing story by HealthDay news service. ,"While still needing some improvement, this WebMD story does a better job than a competing HealthDay piece of covering an experimental new treatment for hepatitis-C.

He is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.\n\n""Patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria, but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and, in some patients, clinically meaningful activity,"" Janku said.\n\nClostridium novyi has been linked to human illness. In 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the United Kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria.\n\nThe strain used in this clinical trial, Clostridium novyi-NT, had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin, which can be lethal in humans, Janku said. The NT stands for ""non-toxic.""\n\nClostridium novyi flourishes in low-oxygen environments. Researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting, by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site.\n\n""Normal tissues, even if they are low on oxygen, they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate,"" Janku explained. ""Cancerous tissue is low in oxygen, most often in the center of the cancers.""\n\nTo test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer, researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT, ranging from 10,000 to 3 million spores.\n\nFifteen of the patients had sarcoma, two patients had melanoma, and seven had a variety of cancers, the researchers said.\n\nThe scientists expected Clostridium novyi-NT to help fight the tumor in two ways.\n\nFirst, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said.\n\n""If that happens, it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor-specific antigens, which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system,"" Janku said. ""It can prime the immune system to attack the cancer.""\n\nThe bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn\'t kill off tumor cells, Janku added.\n\nPatients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said.\n\n""Clostridium is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics,"" Janku noted.\n\nThe bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients, with tumor cells dying off as a result.\n\nTumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients. However, Janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed, making the lesion appear larger than it actually is.\n\nFollowing bacterial therapy, cancer stabilized in 21 patients. When both injected and uninjected lesions were included, the stable disease rate was 86 percent, the researchers reported.\n\nThe potential for Clostridium novyi-NT to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing, said Sacha Gnjatic, who is associate director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n""That\'s where the promise of this type of therapy lies. You would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you\'re disrupting the tumor cells,"" Gnjatic said. ""What would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non-injected tumors. That\'s the holy grail of immunotherapy.""\n\nJanku said he\'s particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas, which are cancers that occur in bone, muscle and soft tissues.\n\n""Classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn\'t seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas,"" Janku explained.\n\nResearchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. The researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers.\n\nHowever, they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku added.\n\nTwo patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of Clostridium novyi-NT fell ill with sepsis and/or gas gangrene, leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores.\n\nResearchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients, meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked, Janku said.\n\n""That didn\'t result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region, but it\'s a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients,"" Janku said.\n\nPatients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.\n\nThe trial results were to be presented Sunday at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, in New York City. The meeting is jointly sponsored by the Cancer Research Institute, the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy, the European Academy of Tumor Immunology, and the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nResearch presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about cancer treatment.']","The message that the bacterium “appears to target malignant cells and could provide a new means of fighting cancer” is overly optimistic, given that this is a study that was designed to establish a safe dosage level, not show whether there’s a meaningful clinical benefit.","This story reports about a safety trial involving 24 cancer patients in which a weakened form of the bacterium clostridium novyi was injected into tumors. The results were presented at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference.
The story provides appropriately cautions about potential harms. But it explained the results of the study in a way that may cause confusion, among other issues.

It aims to screen 1,700 men for five years, but results from the first 300 men were published in the British Journal of Urology International.\n\nGenetic factors that increase prostate cancer risk include inheritable variations in genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\nProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and kills 254,000 men a year. U.S. doctors routinely recommend PSA screening in men over 50 on the assumption that early diagnosis and treatment is better than doing nothing.\n\nBut fears about overdiagnosis, which can lead to treatments such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side-effects such as impotence and incontinence, have so far dissuaded many European countries from nationwide screening.\n\nThe men in this study — 205 with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and 95 who had tested negative for the mutations — were all offered annual PSA blood testing, and 24 who had raised PSA levels were given a follow-up biopsy.\n\nEeles said the findings added to the increasing evidence that BRCA gene variation carriers develop more aggressive disease and supported the idea that men with genetic risks should be routinely screened for prostate cancer.']","<span style=""font-size: small""><span style=""font-family: Arial"">This story on prostate cancer screening relies too heavily on a press release and needed more independent voices, cost information and other context to help readers understand why more tests do not necessarily equal better health.</span></span>","This story reports on the results of a new study evaluating the effectiveness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in men with BRCA gene mutations. In preliminary results, the study found that PSA testing was more likely to find cancers in high-risk men than average-risk men. Whether simply finding more cancers would lead to better outcomes in terms of survival remains unclear. 
This story adequately describes the novelty and availability of PSA testing and does not engage in disease mongering. It does a good job of describing the potential harms of PSA testing and of quantifying the possible benefits. The story could have been improved by more fully describing the importance of these findings, quoting an independent expert and describing the costs of the test.

This technology may be used to repair injured tissue or restore function of aging tissue, including organs, blood vessels and nerve cells.\n\nResults of the regenerative medicine study published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.\n\n""By using our novel nanochip technology, injured or compromised organs can be replaced. We have shown that skin is a fertile land where we can grow the elements of any organ that is declining,"" said Dr. Chandan Sen, director of Ohio State\'s Center for Regenerative Medicine & Cell Based Therapies, who co-led the study with L. James Lee, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering with Ohio State\'s College of Engineering in collaboration with Ohio State\'s Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center.\n\nResearchers studied mice and pigs in these experiments. In the study, researchers were able to reprogram skin cells to become vascular cells in badly injured legs that lacked blood flow. Within one week, active blood vessels appeared in the injured leg, and by the second week, the leg was saved. In lab tests, this technology was also shown to reprogram skin cells in the live body into nerve cells that were injected into brain-injured mice to help them recover from stroke.\n\n""This is difficult to imagine, but it is achievable, successfully working about 98 percent of the time. With this technology, we can convert skin cells into elements of any organ with just one touch. This process only takes less than a second and is non-invasive, and then you\'re off. The chip does not stay with you, and the reprogramming of the cell starts. Our technology keeps the cells in the body under immune surveillance, so immune suppression is not necessary,"" said Sen, who also is executive director of Ohio State\'s Comprehensive Wound Center.\n\nTNT technology has two major components: First is a nanotechnology-based chip designed to deliver cargo to adult cells in the live body. Second is the design of specific biological cargo for cell conversion. This cargo, when delivered using the chip, converts an adult cell from one type to another, said first author Daniel Gallego-Perez, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering and general surgery who also was a postdoctoral researcher in both Sen\'s and Lee\'s laboratories.\n\nTNT doesn\'t require any laboratory-based procedures and may be implemented at the point of care. The procedure is also non-invasive. The cargo is delivered by zapping the device with a small electrical charge that\'s barely felt by the patient.\n\n""The concept is very simple,"" Lee said. ""As a matter of fact, we were even surprised how it worked so well. In my lab, we have ongoing research trying to understand the mechanism and do even better. So, this is the beginning, more to come.""\n\nResearchers plan to start clinical trials next year to test this technology in humans, Sen said.\n\n###\n\nFunding for this research was provided by Leslie and Abigail Wexner, Ohio State\'s Center for Regenerative Medicine and Cell-Based Therapies and Ohio State\'s Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center.']","A proof of concept in rodents may be exciting for the researchers, but the news release goes too far in proclaiming a “breakthrough.”","Researchers at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Ohio State’s College of Engineering have published a research letter in Nature Nanotechnology showing that a new technology, called Tissue Nanotransfection (TNT), is able to reprogram skin cells to become vascular cells in mice who had badly injured legs that lacked blood flow. While this highly experimental approach is exciting, there is far too much speculation, particularly in the headline, that the results of this research can be applied to humans.

Study finds tranexamic acid reduces the need for blood transfusions during joint replacement procedures.","['More than a million Americans will undergo hip or knee replacement this year. Doing their due diligence, many will select top-notch orthopedic surgeons, and some will even evaluate the company that makes their implant. Now, researchers in Canada and some highly regarded orthopedic specialists at U.S. hospitals say mounting evidence and clinical experience shows that patients and doctors should consider one more aspect of care often left out of the conversation: Whether it’s appropriate to use a drug called tranexamic acid, or TXA, which is increasingly being viewed as a way to enhance joint replacement surgery by reducing blood loss during these procedures.\n\nA study published last month in the Canadian Journal of Anesthesiology found that administering TXA intravenously to patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery reduced the rate of blood transfusion during those procedures by more than 40 percent, without increasing the length of a patient\'s hospital stay or adverse events, such as heart attack, stroke or blood clot. “The practice of medicine is now catching up to the research on [TXA],"" says Dr. Charles Bush-Joseph, an orthopedic surgeon at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. ""Here at Rush, we’ve been using it for a number of years."" Surgeons administer the drug to prevent the breakdown of clots, or act as a ""clot stabalizer,"" and thereby reduce bleeding and the likelihood a blood transfusion will be needed during surgery. Though blood transfusions are generally considered safe, they still carry risks ranging from allergic reactions to exceedingly rare blood-borne infections.\n\nTXA is widely known as a potential lifesaver, such as on battlefields, where it\'s used to slow blood loss among soldiers injured in combat. Back in the civilian world, clinicians at medical centers including Saint Marys Hospital, one of Mayo Clinic\'s hospitals in Rochester, Minnesota, \u200balso administer the drug to stop patients’ bleeding in cases ranging from automobile crashes to farming accidents, says Dr. Donald Jenkins, \u200bmedical director for the hospital’s Level I Trauma Center.\n\nJenkins says doctors at St. Marys and elsewhere at Mayo use the drug during elective joint replacement surgery as well, and he says the positive results that Canadian researchers found reflect their experience.\n\n“It supports our practice. We have been using TXA for these precise operations for many years – with what we thought was good success,” Jenkins says. “I would have been very surprised had these results come out some other way.”\n\nHe estimates that the cost of the drug administered during surgery is less than $100, and a Canadian researcher puts the price of TXA at $10 per patient there. That compares with upwards of $1,000 or more for a single blood transfusion, Jenkins says. But despite TXA\'s ability to reduce the need for transfusions, the latest figures show TXA is used in only about 1 in 10 joint replacement surgeries.\n\nResearchers at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto describe the drug, studied in more than 400 patients who underwent hip and knee replacement there, as underutilized at hospitals elsewhere in Canada and the U.S. In a statement, Dr. Greg Hare, an anesthesiologist at St. Michael\'s and one of the founders of St. Michael\'s Centre of Excellence for Patient Blood Management, wrote: \u200b""Other hospitals and surgical centres\u200b\u200b should consider making TXA mandatory for similar surgeries because it can improve quality of care, decrease the need for blood transfusions and even save money.""\n\nEven so, the Canadian research team\u200b\u200b still calls for ongoing surveillance of the drug to make sure its use doesn\'t increase adverse events. All experts say individual risk factors should be considered in determining whether it\'s appropriate to use the drug that\'s also sometimes used in non-orthopedic surgeries to slow blood loss, from trauma to cardiac operations.\u200b “We use it very judiciously in our older patient population, who would be at increased risk of stroke and heart attack, because of underlying cardiovascular disease,” Jenkins says.\n\nBecause of the risks associated \u200bwith the drug, which range from the formation of a blood clot in a vein deep in the body, or deep vein thrombosis, to heart attack, Bush-Joseph says some surgeons at Rush remain leery and don’t use it. However, previous research finds a low complication rate when used to slow blood loss during joint replacement procedures. And Bush-Joseph says most orthopedic surgeons at the medical center do use it for elective hip replacements.\n\nBoth he and Jenkins say TXA use is discussed with patients, along with other aspects of surgery. “I would say it’s an element of the informed consent,” Bush-Joseph says, adding that most patients seem to be in favor of it, since it reduces the likelihood they’ll need a blood transfusion.']","Strong on independent sources, this story fell short in the way that it quantified the benefits of this study and in how it framed the evidence.","A large retrospective observational study was conducted to see if encouraging patients to elect tranexamic acid (TXA) therapy in joint replacement surgery was associated with a reduction in costly blood transfusions. Based on this observational study, the story has unfortunately drawn certain conclusions as if the study were a prospective randomized trial and able to prove cause and effect — namely the conclusion that TXA therapy “reduces” blood transfusions. Though we commend the article for exploring the lower-cost alternative of TXA therapy and for consulting several independent sources, the coverage would’ve greatly benefited from a better understanding of the limitations underlying the study. While TXA was “associated with” a reduction in blood transfusions, it is inappropriate to state that the drug “reduced” blood transfusions. There are also some head-scratching links given in the article. For instance, a link on the use of TXA in slowing blood loss among soldiers injured in combat directs to a webpage on the mental health of soldiers.

The burden of figuring out infertility is too often placed on the woman alone.\n\n\n\n""Unfortunately, the majority of society looks at infertility as a women\'s issue, but that\'s just not the case,"" said Brad Imler, American Pregnancy Association president.\n\n\n\nPlaced among dozens of pregnancy, ovulation and female fertility kits, an at-home sperm test that hit retail shelves in April could help change that mentality, experts said.\n\n\n\nSpermCheck Fertility, which determines in minutes whether a man\'s sperm count is low, offers almost instant insight into one of the many aspects of male fertility. Although it\'s not a comprehensive evaluation and could give some consumers a false sense of security, the test does provide a starting point while drawing attention to male infertility as a legitimate health concern.\n\n\n\n""It may provide (an opportunity for) both physicians and couples to take a closer look at ways for men to step up to the plate and optimize their reproductive potential,"" said Dr. Robert Brannigan, urologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""I think anything that highlights the fact that men can have issues, that men do play a role in infertility, is important.""\n\n\n\nApproximately 15 percent of U.S. couples of reproductive age who are trying to conceive face infertility issues, said Brannigan, an expert in male fertility.\n\n\n\nMale infertility contributes to 50 percent of those cases, he said. Male infertility alone is the cause 30 percent of the time; a combination of male and female factors account for the other 20 percent.\n\n\n\nSpermCheck Fertility is designed to help couples determine more quickly whether male infertility might be a problem for them, said Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, based in Charlottesville, Va. Many men put off having a semen analysis because they don\'t want to provide a sample in a doctor\'s office or lab, he said.\n\n\n\n""No one wants to go through the embarrassment of jumping in that room and looking at dirty magazines,"" Lopez said.\n\n\n\nGiving men the opportunity to take a test in the privacy of their home helps get the process moving, he said.\n\n\n\nMen tend to think they\'re perfectly healthy, especially when it comes to their sexuality, APA\'s Imler said. This test, which is noninvasive, could be wake-up call for some.\n\n\n\n""If there is a problem with him, it\'s identified a little quicker,"" Imler said. ""We love the idea of avoiding that heartache of that month to month struggle of trying to conceive without success.""\n\n\n\nSpermCheck Fertility is the only FDA-approved home sperm test currently on the market and available in retail stores, Lopez said. The test costs about $40; the average cost of a semen analysis in a doctor\'s office is about $100.\n\n\n\nAt-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. Four years ago an FDA-approved home test called Fertell, which is no longer for sale, offered an evaluation of both male and female fertility.\n\n\n\nThere are also several at-home sperm analysis kits available online. They each include a microscope and cost at least $80.\n\n\n\nAlthough it\'s not the first ever at-home test, SpermCheck Fertility is the first one to use the lateral flow assay method, Lopez said. When the semen sample is applied to the test strip, the liquid works its way up the paper until it reaches the results window.\n\n\n\n""It\'s very, very similar to a pregnancy test,"" Lopez said. ""The concept behind our test is to keep it simple, user friendly.""\n\n\n\nFor Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she was surprised by the number of steps involved, although none were very difficult.\n\n\n\nScott, a ""mommy blogger"" who requested and received a free test to review, said she wanted her husband to take the test to see if a recent vasectomy had worked. The result showed that the father of four\'s sperm count was below the test\'s threshold.\n\n\n\n""It was blatantly negative. I was really glad that the test was not ambiguous at all,"" she said. ""There was no line I could mistake.""\n\n\n\nScott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. After about 11 months of trying, she had pushed her husband to get a semen analysis from a doctor.\n\n\n\n""If this test had been around back then, he would have definitely been more willing to do it"" than the semen analysis, she said.\n\n\n\n(Also available is a more sensitive product called SpermCheck Vasectomy, which indicates whether a man\'s sperm count is above or below 250,000 sperm per milliliter.)\n\n\n\nSpermCheck Fertility tests were created after a scientist at the University of Virginia discovered a specific protein found only in the head of sperm, Lopez said. By detecting that protein, the test indicates whether or not a semen sample contains 20 million sperm per milliliter.\n\n\n\nAbout 90 percent of fertile men have sperm counts above that concentration, according to the SpermCheck Fertility instructions.\n\n\n\nBut there is not a strict cutoff point between normal or abnormal, Brannigan said. Some men might be considered in the infertile range and have no problem impregnating a woman. And others have sperm counts that seem fine, but they have difficulty.\n\n\n\n""If his sperm concentration is indeed greater than 20 million, that\'s very encouraging,"" Brannigan said. ""But it\'s by no means a definitive marker of proven fertility because there is a significant overlap between fertile and infertile men.""\n\n\n\nAs stated in the SpermCheck Fertility instructions, sperm count is not the only factor that contributes to male fertility. The test is not intended to be a complete semen analysis or an overall indicator of a man\'s fertility, Lopez said.\n\n\n\nThe male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone — at least three that aren\'t addressed by SpermCheck — that affect male fertility. In addition, hormones and the delivery of the sperm play a part.\n\n\n\n""There are a number of components that lead to a man having normal fertility potential,"" Brannigan said. ""It\'s a complicated picture.""\n\n\n\nFirst of all, a man\'s hormones need to be normal, he said. The hormones drive sperm production, libido and sexual function.\n\n\n\nHormone abnormalities — found in 18 to 20 percent of men with infertility issues — can originate in the brain, pituitary gland or testicles and can be addressed with medical or hormonal treatment, he said.\n\n\n\nAs for sperm production, the concentration or count, volume of ejaculate, motility, morphology and DNA are all important, he said.\n\n\n\nThe higher the sperm concentration the better, Brannigan said. A lower sperm count means decreased odds that a sperm will have a successful encounter with the egg and pregnancy will be achieved.\n\n\n\nThe volume of ejaculate, if low, can indicate a lack of seminal emission, he said.\n\n\n\nIf the sperm don\'t have movement, they can\'t travel from the vaginal fluid to the fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs, he said.\n\n\n\nSome studies suggest that the shape, or morphology, is an indicator for sperm function and that normally shaped sperm are most likely to be capable of reaching the egg and fertilizing it, Brannigan said.\n\n\n\nSperm DNA can also be abnormal or damaged.\n\n\n\nA number of scenarios can negatively affect sperm production, including injury or exposure to excessive heat, harmful chemicals, radiation or toxins, Brannigan said. Medical conditions and genetic disorders also can have an impact.\n\n\n\nThe delivery of the sperm is another area where problems can arise, he said.\n\n\n\nSome men suffer from retrograde ejaculation, a situation where some or all of the ejaculate goes into the bladder instead of exiting the tip of the penis, he said.\n\n\n\nSometimes there will be a high level of bacteria or white blood cells in the semen, which can markedly damage sperm quality, he said. In other cases, there is urine mixing with the sperm.\n\n\n\n""A man can have all these different issues going on,"" Brannigan said. ""I think it\'s important to point out it\'s not just about sperm number.""\n\n\n\nIf men use the SpermCheck test as their only infertility evaluation, there are numerous problems that could be overlooked, he said.\n\n\n\nA positive result from the SpermCheck Fertility test could give men a false sense that everything is all right, APA\'s Imler said.\n\n\n\nIt might even cause some men to delay a necessary doctor\'s evaluation, Brannigan said.\n\n\n\n""By bypassing readily correctable issues in the man, we then shift the burden to the female for testing and procedures that could potentially be averted by optimizing the man\'s reproductive potential,"" he said.\n\n\n\nThe burden is already on the women because most men delay undergoing semen analyses, Lopez said. At least the SpermCheck Fertility test will provide a push to those men who get a negative result.\n\n\n\n""When a man quickly identifies he might have a problem, the first thing a man is going to do is run to the doctor,"" he said.']",An interesting and fairly informative piece about male infertility with a news hook based on a new fertility test.,"This is a fairly thorough and thoughtful analysis of the reasons for male infertility and the pros and cons of this particular home fertility test for men.

Kiwi Fruit May Help,"['En Español\n\nBy Denise Mann\n\nHealthDay Reporter\n\nTUESDAY, Nov. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An apple a day won\'t necessarily keep the doctor away, but three kiwis just might help, at least according to a small study that showed that the brown, fuzzy fruit may lower blood pressure levels.\n\nMen and women with mildly high blood pressure who ate three kiwi fruits a day for eight weeks had systolic blood pressure levels that were 3.6 millimeters of mercury lower than those of volunteers who ate an apple a day. Systolic blood pressure is the upper number in a blood pressure measurement.\n\nKiwis may be small, but they pack a lot of nutrition in their green flesh. They are rich in lutein, a potent antioxidant, and this may be what is responsible for their blood pressure-lowering powers, said researchers who were led by Mette Svendsen of Oslo University Hospital in Norway. The study was to be presented Tuesday at the American Heart Association\'s annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.\n\nCardiologists were quick to caution that there is no single magic food or ingredient that is the key to heart health, but they all agreed that kiwi may have a place in the five daily servings of fruit and vegetables that are currently recommended as part of a heart-healthy diet.\n\nThe new study included 50 men and 68 women with an average age of 55 who were randomly assigned to eat three kiwis or one apple a day for eight weeks. Participants had blood pressure levels in the mildly elevated range of 128/85 when the study began. A blood pressure reading that is less than 120/80 is considered ideal. They changed nothing in their diet other than adding the fruit. Researchers measured blood pressure via 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, which is thought to be more precise than measuring it during a single point in time.\n\nThe Oslo University Hospital funded the study.\n\n""Three kiwi a day improved 24-hour blood pressure more than an apple a day,"" the researchers concluded.\n\nSo, is kiwi the new ""wonder"" fruit?\n\n""There is biological plausibility, but I would not go and grab three kiwis a day,"" said Dr. Nehal Mehta, a preventive cardiologist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. ""They are not easy to find or one of those fruits that people readily grab.""\n\nModeration is the key with kiwis or any food, he said. ""Three kiwis a day or 21 kiwis a week does not seem like moderation, and I would caution against eating that much,"" he said.\n\nThe new study may just ""put kiwis on the map,"" he said. ""When we say \'eat more fresh fruit,\' we stick to the tried-and-true or anything that is handheld and peeled, but these findings suggest that a kiwi can be part of a heart-healthy diet,"" he said.\n\nIn addition, the study looked at the whole fruit, not individual nutrients. Don\'t start popping lutein in supplement form based on these results, he noted.\n\nDr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed. ""Kiwi is not the wonder fruit, but certainly adding kiwi to your diet can help decrease mildly high blood pressure levels.""\n\nDr. Elliott M. Antman, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said that while promising, the new study is small. ""Don\'t count on this to be the complete answer to high blood pressure,"" he said. Whatever you do, ""do not stop taking your blood pressure medications without talking to your doctor,"" he added.\n\nBecause this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Dash diet is often recommended to lower blood pressure levels.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story asks whether kiwi is the “new wonder fruit” after a study shows a tiny drop in systolic blood pressure in people with pre-hypertension.  How is this newsworthy? </span>","To its credit, the story included some excellent balancing quotes from independent sources.
However, there was no discussion of the fact that the blood pressure drop was small and the participants had pre-hypertension, not hypertension. The story does not make this distinction or provide information about it, though it is readily available.
This is some of what we get in the flood of stories based on some of the countless papers presented at a huge conference such as the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions.

The distorted valve functions poorly, its flaps swinging apart. Blood that is supposed to be pumped into the body backs up into the heart and lungs.\n\nA vicious cycle ensues: The heart enlarges, so the mitral valve leaks. The leaky mitral valve makes the heart enlarge even more, as it tries to compensate, and heart failure worsens.\n\nIn the new study, a device called the MitraClip was used to repair the mitral valve by clipping its two flaps together in the middle. (The clip is made by Abbott, which funded the study; outside experts reviewed the trial data.)\n\nThe result was to convert a valve that barely functioned into one able to regulate blood flow in and out of the heart.\n\nUntil today, researchers were not sure that fixing the mitral valve would do much to help these patients. A smaller study in France with similar patients failed to find a benefit for the MitraClip.\n\nBut that research included many patients with less severe valve problems, the procedure was not performed as adeptly, and the patients’ medications were not as well optimized as in the new study.\n\nIn the new trial, 614 patients with severe heart failure in the United States and Canada were randomly assigned to receive a MitraClip along with standard medical treatment or to continue with standard care alone.']",,"This story reported on results of a randomized clinical trial of a device called the MitraClip, used to repair the mitral valve in patients with heart failure.

In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said.\n\n""We know that folate plays a really critical role in brain development and brain function,"" said Dr. Daniel Armstrong, associate chair of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n""We know that, in young children, folate deficiencies are associated with poorer neurocognitive function and neurocognitive development,"" he noted. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added.\n\nArmstrong thinks that a diet rich in folate might be important for brain functioning throughout life. ""It\'s one of those things that\'s no harm, no foul. It\'s not going to do us any harm and it might do us some good,"" he said.\n\nTo find out whether folate might do some good, a team led by Dr. Torbjorn K. Nilsson, from the department of laboratory medicine at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden, collected data on folic acid levels in 386 teens aged 15 years. The researchers also looked at any possible effects of socioeconomic status and genetics.\n\nThe investigators found that teens who had the highest levels of folic acid also got the best grades. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson\'s team noted.\n\n""These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence.

Abroms, ScD, MA, an associate professor of prevention and community health at Milken Institute School of Public Health (Milken Institute SPH) at the George Washington University. ""The study\'s findings suggest a potential new quitting strategy, especially for those later in their pregnancies and older pregnant women.""\n\nThe researchers recruited pregnant women who were already enrolled in an established text messaging program called Text4baby. Text4baby has been found to have a positive health impact on alcohol consumption during pregnancy--but not smoking. Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. To find out, the team recruited nearly 500 pregnant women, who smoked an average of 7 cigarettes per day and wanted more help to quit.\n\nQuit4baby is targeted to smoking cessation and sends more text messages--between 1 and 8 per day aimed at bolstering a pregnant woman\'s resolve to quit. The messages help educate the women about the health risks associated with smoking and they are interactive--allowing a woman to text back for more help if she is experiencing a craving or goes back to smoking.\n\nAfter three months, 16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby. However, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance, the authors say.\n\nThe more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. The combo of Text4baby and Quit4baby helped women age 26 and older and those in the second and third trimester of pregnancy quit through the delivery date and in some cases beyond. However, the researchers found that the resolve to quit seemed to disappear postpartum as many of these women started smoking again.\n\nVery little help is provided to pregnant smokers who want to quit so the study\'s findings are important, especially if the strategy can be adjusted to be more effective, Abroms says. Despite the health risks, about 10 percent of women smoke throughout their pregnancy in the United States.\n\nAdditional studies must be done to find out if Quit4baby can be paired with other smoking cessation tools in order to provide long-term help for pregnant women who want to kick their smoking habit for good, she says.\n\nThe study, ""A Randomized Trial of Text Messaging for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women,"" was published October 2 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\n###\n\nThe research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Abroms has stock in Wellpass Inc. (formerly Voxiva, Inc.) and has licensed Text2quit and Quit4baby to Wellpass.\n\nAbout Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University: Established in July 1997 as the School of Public Health and Health Services, Milken Institute School of Public Health is the only school of public health in the nation\'s capital. Today, more than 1,900 students from 54 U.S. states and territories and more than 50 countries pursue undergraduate, graduate and doctoral-level degrees in public health.

Possible benefits requiring further study were seen only with older women and those in later stages of pregnancy.,"Editor’s note: On the day this  review was published, the news release it’s based on was removed from the EurekAlert! site. We have saved the original news release as a pdf.
Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful.
This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it’s concerning to see this news release headlined: “Text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.” A more accurate headline would have been: “Text messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.”
The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered “hypothesis-generating,” meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations here.
The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story.  And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully.

Around 70 per cent of secondary breast cancer patients have tumours in the bone.\n\nLarge scale clinical trials indicate a group of bone strengthening drugs known as bisphosphonates can help prevent the disease from spreading to bone in breast cancer patients if given early enough.\n\n“The difficulty is identifying which patients will benefit from these drugs,” said Professor Robert Coleman, emeritus professor of medical oncology who led the new study. “It only seems to be effective in some patients, particularly older women, while others show no response and in some younger women it may even be harmful.”\n\nThe new study, which is published in the journal Lancet Oncology, has shown it may be possible to identify women who will benefit from bisphosphonates by using a test that looks for a gene known as MAF. Women who do not carry the gene - approximately 80 per cent of women with breast cancer - were found to benefit from the bone strengthening treatment.\n\nProfessor Coleman said: ""If the test is negative for this gene, then they can be offered this bone strengthening treatment, which can give them a better chance of surviving their cancer.”\n\nA test for the gene, known as MAFTest, has been developed by a Spanish medical company called Inbiomotion following work conducted at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB) in Barcelona.\n\nThe new study, which is published in the journal Lancet Oncology, was part of an international phase 3 clinical trial involving 3,360 women with stage II or III breast cancer.\n\nThe results need to be confirmed in a second trial, currently underway in the United States, before the test is likely to receive approval for wider use in patients. But if successful, it could be incorporated into the routine testing of breast cancer patients to see if they could benefit from bisphosphonate treatments such as zoledronic acid. Those found not to carry the gene could be given the drug after having surgery and radiotherapy for their primary tumour in an effort to prevent the cancer from spreading.\n\nAround 50,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK each year and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 annually.\n\n“The discovery made at IRB Barcelona and tested in the current study could be of great use to clinicians and would avoid unnecessary treatment of patients who would not benefit or could be harmed by the treatment,"" added Professor Roger Gomis, leader of the growth control and cancer metastasis group at IRB Barcelona, who was a co-author on the study.\n\nAdditional information Read the paper in Lancet Oncology Coleman RE, Hall A, Albanell J, Hanby A, Bell R, Cameron D, Dodwell D, Marshall H, Jean-Mairet J, Tercero JC, Rojo F, Gregory W, and Gomis RR.

We encourage news release writers to give patients the hard facts they need to assess claims and make informed decisions.,"The news release gives a strong impression that a new genetic test could help women “fight” secondary breast cancers, specifically bone metastases.

Although the published study reports results from an international clinical trial, there was no mention of cost or context of the results seen by researchers. The release did mention that the results found in the UK needed to be confirmed in a second trial before any specific recommendation is made to incorporate testing for this new genetic marker.

Some women who test positive opt for prophylactic surgery to remove their breasts or ovaries.\n\n""Women who test negative for BRCA don\'t require excessive interventions just because BRCA is in the family,"" said Allison Kurian, an assistant professor of both medicine and health research and policy at Stanford and lead author of the study.\n\nThe findings, published online Monday by the Journal of Clinical Oncology, are based on an analysis of 3,047 families, including 292 with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, enrolled in a breast-cancer family registry. Researchers said it was the largest study yet undertaken to assess breast-cancer risk among non-carriers of inheritable mutations.\n\nThe results support current guidelines that say non-BRCA mutation carriers in families affected by the BRCA genes don\'t need special screening beyond mammography as recommended for the general population, and needn\'t consider preventive surgery.\n\nThe BRCA mutations are associated with a five-fold risk of getting breast cancer and a 20-fold risk of ovarian cancer compared with people without the mutations, according to the National Cancer Institute. The chance that women who inherent the genes will get breast cancer during their lives is 45% to 65%; the likelihood is 11% to 40% for ovarian cancer.\n\nThe heightened risk has prompted women whose mothers or sisters were diagnosed with BRCA-positive tumors to get tested themselves, with the assumption that a negative test meant their chances of developing the cancers was low.\n\nThat\'s why the 2007 study was so troubling. It ""cast doubt on the whole meaning of a negative test result,"" Dr. Kurian said. ""We all see genetic tests as giving relatives an out when it\'s negative.""\n\nDr. Kurian said the earlier study had methodological flaws that may have led to an overestimate of risk for non-BRCA carriers.\n\nSeveral other published studies have subsequently contradicted the 2007 findings. Monday\'s study, though, is special because it is population-based, not based on patients going to a clinic. Therefore it has a broader representation of mutation-carrying families, said Mark Robson, clinic director of the clinical genetics service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Dr. Robson, who wasn\'t an involved in the study but his team did a study that also contradicted the 2007 research, wrote an editorial accompanying it.\n\nEric Winer, chief of the division of women\'s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston who wasn\'t involved in the current research, said the study shows that for women in families with an inherited breast-cancer gene but who don\'t inherit it, the risk of developing cancer does not appear to be significantly increased. They may still face a slightly elevated risk because they have a family member with the disease.\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com and Shirley S. Wang at shirley.wang@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was a solid report on a new study about genetic testing for breast cancer, confirming that current guidelines are reasonable. </span>","But our reviewers were troubled by the story’s headline and lead sentence, which they felt overreached with its suggestion that the study results “weaken the case for preventive mastectomy” in women who test negative for certain cancer mutations, because there there was never strong evidence that these women were at increased risk and that mastectomy was something that they would consider.

Diagnosis and disease monitoring relies on several parameters, including clinical examination, MRI, cerebrospinal fluid assessment, and electrophysiology.\n\nMS is a chronic disease, so current diagnostic and monitoring tests are costly and still have limited utility to discriminate between different stages of the disease.\n\nKey findings\n\nIn addition to identifying biomarkers that distinguish healthy people from those with MS, the researchers identified nine unique micro-RNA molecules that differentiate between two MS sub-types: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS.\n\nRelapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) affects 70 percent of people and often evolves into a secondary progressive form of MS. 10-15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with a progressive form of the disease from the outset known as primary progressive MS.\n\nThe team also validated eight out of nine micro-RNA molecules in an independent group of progressive MS cases, confirming the reproducibility of the findings.\n\n""This is the first demonstration that micro-RNAs associated with circulating exosomes in blood are informative biomarkers not only for the diagnosis of MS, but in predicting disease subtypes with a high degree of accuracy,"" said Associate Professor Michael Buckland, Head of the Department of Neuropathology at RPA Hospital and the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney.\n\nThe research was made possible through the generosity of patients at the Brain & Mind Centre\'s multidisciplinary Multiple Sclerosis Clinic, a collaborative service offered by Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, and the University of Sydney. The research was funded by an Incubator grant from MS Research Australia.\n\n""This blood test may allow people with MS to begin treatment earlier, and identify the most appropriate treatment for their condition,"" said Dr Matthew Miles, CEO MS Research Australia.\n\n""This, in turn may lead to fewer relapses and a slower loss of brain volume, resulting in slowing or potentially halting progression of the disease for the person living with MS. It will also help remove the uncertainty surrounding which sub type of the disease an individual has and therefore be a catalyst for better outcomes for all people with MS.""\n\nAbout the science\n\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS).\n\nThe research team assessed the utility of microRNAs (miRNA) in serum (blood) exosomes as biomarkers of MS disease.\n\nMicro-RNA are small non-coding RNA that control many genes and processes vital for cellular life such as metabolism, development and the immune system. They are called miRNA because they are very short, only 18-25 letters long. Science has so far identified about 1800 human miRNAs.\n\nExosomes are nano-sized particles shed by almost all cell types in the body and are packed with micro-RNAs and other types of small RNA. The research team has shown previously that some micro-RNAs are selectively packaged into exosomes for release from the cell.\n\nExosomes are tiny packages released by both healthy and diseased cells in the body. They circulate in blood and can be purified in their millions from a single vial of blood. Dubbed the biological equivalent of \'tweeting\', the exosomes circulate throughout the body and can deliver their cargo of information to multiple cells in almost real-time.\n\nIn inflammatory diseases such as MS, there is a significant increase in circulating exosome concentrations.\n\n""In studying the blood exosomes of healthy volunteers and patients with MS, the research team identified a \'molecular signature\' of MS that not only correctly diagnoses MS, but also discriminates between patients with different stages of disease,"" Associate Professor Buckland said.\n\n""Exosomes released by brain cells circulating in the blood, so they offer an easily accessible way to monitor diseases of the brain. We are only now starting to wake up to their enormous potential as clinical tests.""\n\nGiven exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier, it is likely that some of the circulating exosomes in MS patients come from affected central nervous system cells or the associated inflammatory milieu.\n\nThe researchers hypothesised that physiological changes associated with MS and its progression is reflected in differences in serum exosomal micro-RNAs.\n\nUsing next generation sequencing and integrative bioinformatics they found that serum exosome micro-RNA profiles not only distinguish MS from healthy controls, but also distinguish relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) from progressive MS with high accuracy.\n\n###\n\nAssociate Professor Michael Buckland is Head of the Molecular Neuropathology at the University of Sydney and Head of the Department of Neuropathology at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.']","The release claims that the test results can differentiate between MS and non-MS, and between MS subtypes, but there are no numbers provided for us to assess that.","A study by a group of Australian scientists has found a link between micro-RNA molecules in blood and multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease that remains difficult to diagnose. The release does a credible job of explaining the target focuses of this basic research—micro-RNAs and exosomes, constituents of cells that find their way in the bloodstream—but offers little in the way of methodological details. The text also jumps the gun by labeling the study a “breakthrough” and making claims about treatment benefits that are completely hypothetical at this point. Any blood test resulting from the effort has miles to go before it is ready for clinical use.

And because it has few side effects, researchers are studying whether light therapy can help with depression during pregnancy and be used to treat elderly people with dementia. It is also being investigated for the treatment of bulimia nervosa, severe premenstrual syndrome and even attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder.\n\nThough randomized controlled clinical trials of bright light are difficult to do properly — one expert is fond of saying that it is difficult to “blind” studies of bright light — the American Psychiatric Association considers bright-light therapy an effective low-risk treatment for both S.A.D. and nonseasonal major depressive disorder.\n\nA 2006 multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial that compared bright-light therapy head to head with the popular antidepressant Prozac (fluoxetine) in 96 subjects found the two treatments equally effective for alleviating winter depression, though light produced results faster, usually within a week, and with fewer side effects.\n\nWhy, then, do so few doctors prescribe bright-light therapy? Some say their patients don’t have the patience to sit in front of a light for 30 to 45 minutes every morning. Moreover, “doctors are just more comfortable prescribing medication, because that’s what they do for everything,” Dr. Lewy said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome patients who suffer from chronic depression say they use light therapy in addition to their regular medication in the winter months.\n\n“I’ve always seen a drastic change in my personality from spring and summer to fall and winter, and it got worse as I got older,” said Rick Bach, 54, a painter who owns a hair salon in West Hartford, Conn., and tries to spend every January in Puerto Rico.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut while bright-light treatment is helpful, he said, it is not sufficient for him. “It can help you from falling into a deep depression, but it won’t help you climb out of one,” he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Light also has an effect on hormones, the body’s chemical messengers, affecting the brain’s hypothalamus, which is involved in regulating mood, energy and appetite.\n\n“The hormone melatonin, which is secreted at night, can be suppressed by light,” Dr. Rosenthal said. “Studies have also shown that light influences serotonin and epinephrine pathways in the brain, the same neurotransmitter systems known to be affected in people with general depression.”\n\nBut while part of the appeal of light therapy is that it can be self-prescribed, using a light box is not as simple as it may appear. Experts recommend consulting with a knowledgeable health care provider before starting treatment to rule out other medical conditions and to help with monitoring and adjusting bright-light exposure.\n\nSome patients may want to try simply getting more natural light to help with seasonal mood changes — getting out as much as possible during the brightest time of day in the winter, sitting near windows during the day or taking vacations to sunny locales in the winter.\n\nIf you choose to try light therapy, here are a few tips from experts.\n\nCOSTS Light boxes can be purchased for about $200 online; they are also available for rent. Some patients manage to get insurance reimbursement by having a doctor write a letter, but don’t count on your policy covering it.\n\nPRECAUTIONS Side effects include headaches and hypomania, though experts say these are rare. Face the light but do not stare at the light.

It has not been published in a journal, and therefore has yet to undergo peer review.\n\nSupplements of this kind, however, are not subject to the rigorous U.S. Food and Drug Administration safety and efficacy testing typically applied to all pharmaceutical medications.\n\n""This was indeed a small study,"" acknowledged corresponding study author Joe Vinson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Scranton, in Pennsylvania, but he noted that prior research has been conducted in both France and Japan. ""Those studies demonstrated that patients experienced somewhat mild weight loss. But here, with higher extract doses than have been used before, the patients experienced what I would call rather large weight loss.""\n\n""While this of course needs to be confirmed with follow-up, I do think the subject is absolutely worthy of further exploration,"" Vinson added.\n\nVinson said his team was not focused on the weight-loss impact of caffeine as much as that of unprocessed, unroasted coffee\'s primary ingredient: chlorogenic acid.\n\n""That\'s the main natural compound in unroasted coffee, and roasted coffee has much, much less of it than unprocessed coffee,"" Vinson said. ""So we\'re not talking about something that is interchangeable with the coffee we drink,"" which is produced by roasting beans at a temperature between 464 and 482 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nGreen coffee-bean extracts are sold online at prices ranging from about $10 to $20 for 60 capsules.\n\nThe study was broken into three six-week sections. In one section, study participants, who were all between the ages of 22 and 26, consumed a capsule filled with 700 milligrams of green coffee extract. In the second section, participants took a 1,050-milligram capsule. The third section had participants taking a placebo. Each patient ultimately cycled through each section.\n\nWhile maintaining their pre-study dietary and exercise regimens, the patients lost an average of 17 pounds by the study\'s close. On average, patients lost 10.5 percent and 16 percent of their body weight and body fat, respectively.\n\n""Basically, there was steady weight loss, without side effects, while the active green coffee extract was being taken at either dose,"" Vinson said.\n\nA follow-up study involving 60 patients is now in the planning stages.\n\nLona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas, cautioned that the study is short on specifics, making it difficult to draw any conclusions.\n\n""First of all, you need more than 16 people to have any statistical significance attached to these findings,"" Sandon said. ""And we really have no idea how this might be working. For example, the patients were allowed to continue with their regular diet. But did this extract in any way influence their hunger and what they wanted to eat, and then what they actually ate? We don\'t know. What we have here is basically just a hypothesis that there\'s something about this compound that could be helpful.""\n\n""Just because it might cause weight loss doesn\'t mean it\'s healthy,"" she warned.

""It stimulates a whole cascade of hormones in the body and brain; it stimulates normal function of a system that was working at a younger age so that cells can do what they were programmed to do at birth.""\n\nResults of the study are published in the Aug. 6 issue of the Archives of Neurology.\n\nAs levels of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) decrease with age, so too do other hormones stimulated by GHRH, such as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1. All of these hormones are believed to play a role in brain health, and decreasing levels of these hormones are suspected to play a role in the development of Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\nIn a previous study, Baker and her colleagues demonstrated that treatment with GHRH provided a short-term boost in memory and concentration for healthy adults. In the current study, they wanted to see if GHRH could help restore some function in people who were showing signs of a condition known as mild cognitive impairment. People with this condition don\'t yet have Alzheimer\'s disease, but they do have problems with memory and focus, and they\'re at higher risk of developing Alzheimer\'s disease, according to the Alzheimer\'s Foundation.\n\nIn all, 137 adults, including 61 with mild cognitive impairment, completed the current study. The study volunteers were between 55 and 87 years old, with an average age of 68, according to the study.\n\nThe study participants were randomly assigned to receive a daily self-administered injection of growth hormone-releasing hormone or a placebo injection for 20 weeks. The study medications were supplied by the manufacturer of the growth hormone-releasing hormone.\n\nStudy funding was provided by grants from the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nTests to measure mental prowess were given at the start of the study, and at 10, 20 and 30 weeks after treatment began.\n\nBaker said the researchers saw benefits in healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment who received GHRH. They saw improvement in ""planning, organizing, focusing and shifting from one task to another"" -- tasks collectively known as executive function. Baker said the researchers also saw a mild improvement in verbal memory in those treated with GHRH, but the results weren\'t as strong as for the executive function tasks.\n\nTreatment with GHRH boosted levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) by 117 percent, according to the study. ""IGF1 is a hormone we all have from birth that increases through development until it starts to decline in our early 50s. It promotes all kinds of growth in the body and brain, but if you have excess IGF1, it may put you at risk for cancer,"" said Baker, who added that people with Alzheimer\'s disease tend to have low levels of IGF1.\n\nBenefits from the treatment lasted as long as people stayed on the treatment. When treatment was stopped, the benefits gradually tapered off, Baker said.\n\nInsulin levels also spiked during treatment with GHRH, but only in the group already having memory problems. Baker said it wasn\'t clear why this happened, but she suspects the body may be trying to compensate for an insulin shortage in the brain in people with memory problems. Insulin helps glucose (sugar) enter cells to provide fuel for those cells.\n\nDr. Joel Zonszein, an endocrinologist from Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, praised the study but said some questions still remain.\n\n""This was an impressive study showing how GHRH can have a positive effect on cognitive function,"" Zonszein said. ""The question is, how can we use this in normal individuals? When GHRH goes down with aging, it\'s a physiological adaptation. And, we don\'t know what would happen if we gave it chronically.""\n\nFor instance, ""would you alter the feedback mechanism that keeps IGF1 levels from increasing cancer risk? Would it start to lose some of its effect long term?"" he said.\n\n""There may be both good and bad effects,"" Zonszein added.\n\nThe researchers said larger and longer trials are needed to assess the hormone\'s therapeutic potential.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about mild cognitive impairment from the Alzheimer\'s Foundation.']",70% of the stories we review fail to adequately address costs.

Mice that got the drug orally had 40 to 50 percent fewer tumors, while those injected with the drug had 72 percent fewer tumors.\n\nThe findings were so strong the team now wants to test it in smokers to see if it can keep then from developing tumors.\n\n“Although smoking cessation is the most important step for current smokers, over half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed in former smokers, raising the importance of identifying those at highest risk and identifying effective preventive treatments,” Dennis, whose findings were published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research, said in a statement.\n\nOther studies have shown that metformin can cut diabetics’ risk of pancreatic and breast cancers, and the latest finding now suggests it may defend the body against smoking-induced lung tumors.\n\n“This important laboratory study, together with prior laboratory and epidemiology research, suggests that metformin may be useful in cancer prevention and treatment,” said Dr. Michael Pollak of McGill University in Montreal, who wrote a review on metformin research in the same journal.\n\nThe World Health Organization says tobacco is the leading preventable cause of death globally, killing more than 5 million people each year from heart disease, cancer and lung disease.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 20 percent of U.S. adults smoke.

The drug, known as Fevipiprant (QAW039), was shown to reduce asthma symptoms as well as inflammation, and it improved lung function and repaired airway linings.\n\nThe pill may be a “game changer for future treatment of asthma,” said Professor Chris Brightling, a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Senior Research Fellow at the University of Leicester, in a press release.\n\nIn the study, the researchers examined 61 participants who were divided into two groups: The first was given 225mg of the drug twice a day for 12 weeks, and the second group was given a placebo. By measuring the sputum eosinophil — the inflammation marker that shows how white blood cells increase during asthma attacks — the researchers were able to track the effects of the drug. When asthma symptoms occur, the number of white blood cells rises, and this measurement is used to define how severe the condition is. For people with asthma, a sputum eosinophil reading will typically be around five percent, compared to people without asthma, who have readings that are lower than one percent.\n\nPixabay, public domain\n\nAs the researchers tracked the participants over the course of 12 weeks, they found that those taking the drug saw a decrease in their sputum eosinophil reading from an average of 5.4 percent to 1.1 percent.\n\n“A unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms, lung function using breathing tests, sampling of the airway wall and CT scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works,” said Brightling in the press release. “Most treatments might improve some of these features of disease, but with Fevipiprant improvements were seen with all the types of tests. We already know that using treatments to target eosinophilic airway inflammation can substantially reduce asthma attacks.”\n\nUltimately, the researchers hope that the drug “could likewise help to stop preventable asthma attacks, reduce hospital admissions and improve day-to-day symptoms – making it a ‘game changer’ for future treatment,” said Brightling.\n\nSource: Brightling C, et al. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, 2016.']",This story offers readers no information beyond the contents of a news release.,"This story is one of two we’re reviewing that describes a clinical trial for fevipiprant, an asthma pill under development by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. The other review covers a story in Reuters.
This story offers readers no information beyond the contents of a news release from the University of Leicester (England), where the trial was performed. It reports a researcher’s sensationalistic claim that the pill may be a “game changer” without comment from an independent source. (We also reviewed the news release.)
While the Reuters story and its headline maintain a measured tone, this headline hyping a “new asthma pill” that makes a “huge difference” may leave the impression that the drug is close to being available when in fact it’s years from potential approval. In sum, asthma sufferers should not plan to chuck out their inhalers any time soon.

The results from a clinical trial of more than 1,200 patients showed that the drug reduced diarrhea, pain and bloating and that the effects lasted at least 10 weeks after its use was stopped, said Dr. Mark Pimentel of Cedars, who led the study. Previous studies with other antibiotics have shown little or no benefit and, even when benefit was obtained, the effects did not persist after the drug was stopped.\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common medical problems in the United States, affecting 15% or more of the population. Symptoms can include severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, urgency and gas. About 60% to 70% of patients have a form of IBS that is characterized primarily by diarrhea, while the rest have a form that is characterized by constipation. Most treatments are aimed at the symptoms and have little effect on the course of the disease.\n\nMore than a decade ago, Pimental and his colleagues studied the breath of IBS patients who had diarrhea and concluded that the symptoms were being produced when the intestines were overgrown by bacteria. The excess bacteria produce large amounts of hydrogen and methane through fermentation. ""Just bacteria in general, not any particular bacteria,"" Pimentel said. The findings ""were very controversial initially, but there have been a series of studies showing that they were reproducible,"" he said.\n\nInitial studies showed that killing off the excess bacteria with antibiotics provided some benefit. To achieve the maximum benefit with minimal side effects, Pimentel decided to try rifaximin, which is unable to pass through the walls of the intestine and thus has no effects on the rest of the body. The drug, sold under the brand name Xifaxan by Salix Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Morrisville, N.C., is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of traveler\'s diarrhea. The new clinical trial was designed to seek approval for marketing it for IBS.\n\nHalf the patients in the trial received rifaximin for two weeks and half a placebo. The drug reduced bloating, diarrhea and abdominal pain and improved stool consistency, Pimentel said. ""The most noteworthy thing is this is the first drug you take for two weeks and stay better after that,"" he said. ""You shouldn\'t stay better unless you did something to the cause of IBS.""\n\nCedars has a patent on this use of the drug. Salix funded the clinical trial, and Pimentel is a member of their scientific advisory board and a consultant to the company.\n\n— Thomas H. Maugh II']","Where are the independent sources, caveats about results presented at conferences, or, um, data?","The 457 word story presents a glowing appraisal of a study reported in an abstract at a scientific meeting.  The study has not been subjected to peer review and the abstract provided is, by its very nature, incomplete in many of the study details necessary to draw any definitive conclusions.

Unfortunately, many patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome are severely impacted by the symptoms and do not find adequate relief or long term relief from available treatments.  As a result, many resort to off label use of available drugs to combat the disorder.  The primary investigator of the study has written a book entitled, ""A New IBS Solution"" in which he promotes among other treatments the use of rifaximin, a use that has yet to be approved by the FDA.

REUTERS/Avrum Spira/Handout\n\nAnd, they said, a natural supplement derived from food that is being tested to prevent lung cancer appears to halt the precancerous changes.\n\n“Even in normal cells or premalignant cells prior to cancer development we see this pathway being turned on,” said Andrea Bild of the University of Utah, who worked on the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nThe main gene is called PI3K and it affects a pathway of other genes, Bild, Avrum Spira of Boston University and colleagues reported. And it can be found in the windpipes of smokers, meaning they do not need more dangerous and uncomfortable lung tests.\n\n“These cells are like a canary in the coal mine,” Spira said in a telephone interview. “Even though lung cancer develops deep down in your lungs when you smoke, these cells can tell you whether you are on the way to developing lung cancer. It is sort of a window into the lung.”\n\nCigarette smoke causes 90 percent of all cases of lung cancer, which kills 1.2 million people a year globally.\n\nBut only about 10 percent of smokers ever develop lung cancer, although they often die of other causes such as heart disease, stroke or emphysema.\n\nSpira and Bild put together results from two ongoing trials of smokers.\n\n“The patients walk in the door and they have something wrong with them — we don’t know what. Maybe they have lung cancer, maybe they have something else,” Bild said in a telephone interview.\n\nLung cancer is so deadly precisely because it causes vague symptoms. Most patients are not diagnosed until it has spread and can no longer be treated.\n\nACTIVE GENES\n\nThe researchers used a brush to collect cells from the windpipes of the smokers. They put these on a gene chip or microarray to see which genes were active in the cells.\n\n“We found this certain pathway, PI3K, was turned on in patients that had lung cancer as opposed to patients that had other problems,” Bild said.\n\nPI3K had long been suspected in lung cancer. But another experiment got the researchers more excited.\n\nThese were patients with precancerous lesions in their lungs called dysplasia. PI3K was also active in their lesions.\n\nAnd the second group was taking the natural supplement, myo-inositol, to try to prevent lung cancer. In the patients whose lesions shrank after taking the supplement, PI3K also became less active, the researchers found.\n\n“Together it gives us the story of the importance of this pathway,” Bild added. “Whether it is going to save millions of people, who knows?”\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nSpira said he is working with Boston-based Allegro Diagnostics, which is halfway through a 60-patient clinical trial of the test.\n\nThe researchers have patented their findings through the universities but Bild said myo-inositol supplements are cheap and freely available.\n\nMyo-inositol is also found in fruits, beans, grains and nuts, although Bild said the finding does not necessarily explain why people who eat more of these foods have a lower risk of cancer in general.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span new="""" roman="""" times="""">Reporting on very preliminary research that suggests lung cancer can be predicted with a genetic test and subsequently prevented by a supplement, this story fails to meet several of our criteria. </span></span>","

The study took place at 28 medical centers in nine countries in Europe, North America and Asia.\n\nThe study subjects were women 45 or older with invasive ductal breast carcinoma who were undergoing breast-conserving surgery. Half were randomly assigned to undergo conventional treatment — whole breast external radiation in the weeks after their surgeries — and half got targeted radiation during surgery.\n\nThe partial breast treatment, called targeted intraoperative radiotherapy, involves a single 30-minute dose of radiation delivered from a probe inside the surgical cavity.\n\nThe recurrence rate was the same for both groups. The targeted therapy has the advantage of no treatment delay, a shorter treatment time and greater convenience for most patients. The rates of complications and side effects were similar in the two groups.\n\nThe therapy also avoids irradiation of the heart, lung and esophagus, said study investigator Dr. Dennis Holmes, associate professor of clinical surgery at the University of Southern California\'s Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nHolmes said most patients would be good candidates for the targeted treatment. ""It\'s best for women with a small tumor that is well-defined and involves only one portion of the breast,"" he said.\n\nA potential disadvantage is that pathology results from the tumor are not available during surgery, so some patients will need more treatment, he said.\n\n""That\'s a situation we like to avoid,"" Holmes said.

The study found that both treatments resulted in similar rates of breast cancer recurrence. The story does a nice job of describing the study and adding the appropriate caveats. For example, the writer makes it clear that the single-dose regimen may require subsequent conventional radiation therapy, as pathology results are not always available at the time of surgery. This story would have been vastly improved had it included data from the trial, mentioned costs, given more detail on associated harms, pointed out potential conflicts of interest, and adequately compared the single-dose radiation therapy to other accelerated radiation therapy regimens.

She had exhausted all of her chemotherapy options, and this experimental treatment was her last hope. The only other option was hospice.\n\n“At least 60 to 70 percent of her body was covered by lesions, inflammation and thickened, purplish skin,” said Yuan Yuan, M.D., breast cancer oncologist at City of Hope, who treated Young. “Six weeks into her treatment, the skin lesions were gone, her itchiness went away. It’s quite a dramatic response.”\n\nSo dramatic, in fact, that Yuan refers to Young as her “miracle patient.”\n\n“This in some ways is pretty unprecedented. This patient is at a late stage of her disease. There are no treatments available that would have done the same thing,” said Don J. Diamond, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Experimental Therapeutics at City of Hope.\n\nYoung received a combination of the p53 vaccine and the drug pembrolizumab. Diamond developed the vaccine and has been studying its effectiveness in clinical trials at COH since 2010. He currently is testing it on ovarian cancer and other solid tumors, such as pancreatic and gastrointestinal masses.\n\n“I've responded great. I'm feeling good,” said Young, who has received six of seven pembrolizumab infusions, each of which takes about a half-hour, and all three p53 vaccine injections. “My skin has cleared up. I think the prognosis is going to be good now.”\n\nTeaching the immune system to fight\n\nThe most frequent mutation across all cancers occurs in a gene called p53, which contributes to cells becoming oncogenic when they produce a mutant form of the p53 protein (p53 gene mutations are present in about 50% of malignancies). Diamond’s vaccine boosts the immune response to many different mutant forms of p53. The researchers tested this vaccine, known as p53MVA, in a 2013 clinical trial and found it to be safe in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers.\n\nHowever, patients whose T cells had pre-existing high levels of a protein named PD1 — a molecule that instructs immune cells to shut down — responded poorly to the anti-p53 vaccine. In a subsequent laboratory study, the COH researchers showed that these patients’ immune cells could be reactivated by treatment with a PD1 inhibitor that is a biosimilar to the clinical drug called pembrolizumab. Together, the vaccine and the drug potentially could form a potent team to reactivate the immune system to quickly clear out cancer cells.\n\nBefore Young, the combination had been tried on patients with recurrent solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and many other cancer types.\n\nSo far, while Diamond has noted an immune response in patients given the combination treatment in clinical trials, he has not seen a clinical benefit.\n\nThat is, until he met Young.\n\n“We have treated a number of different types of patients with the combination, but nothing is even in the same universe as this,” he said.\n\nA 'shocking' response\n\nYoung, who tested positive for the p53 mutation, has been fighting breast cancer for eight years and has undergone “one chemo after another,” Yuan said.\n\nReferred to City of Hope by her physician at Davis, she began responding to the experimental treatment right away, Yuan said, her skin tumors disappearing and the latest biopsies showing no cancer. “The purple, thickened skin has faded away, the skin color has normalized. She’s healed, basically,” she said.\n\n“It’s such a promising early response. It’s quite unusual,” she added. “We have two drugs here so it’s hard to dissect which drug did what, but we do think the vaccine played a key role.”\n\n“It was shocking to me,” said Diamond. “What we have noticed is that her immune response to p53 has been increasing as time goes on. It was of tremendous magnitude in the last [blood] draw.”\n\nThe next step will be to take bone and CT scans to see if the cancer is disappearing internally as well as externally, which Young will receive in a couple of weeks.\n\nEven now, though, Young is “extremely happy with the results,” Yuan said. “Her psychological wellbeing has improved. Her appetite is better, she’s more functional. She went through a lot. It will be very interesting to follow up.”\n\n“I couldn't look at myself. It was really hard,” Young said of the skin lesions she had endured for five years. They started to go away after the third treatment, she said. “Even the marks where it was climbing up my neck are all gone.”Further study needed\n\nWhat Diamond is hoping for now is funding for a full clinical trial so that he can test the combination in advanced triple-negative breast cancer patients who test positive for p53. A couple of major drug companies have already expressed interest in his vaccine, he said.\n\n“What we would like is to have women come here from all over the country and the world to receive this vaccine formula so that we can test this combination,” Diamond said. “If it happened once, maybe it will happen twice. But we’ve got to get these patients in.”\n\nFollowing the success in Young, the formula has recently been given to two other triple negative breast cancer patients at City of Hope. It’s too early to gauge the response, although “the entire breast team is very excited about this,” Diamond said. “We saw this phenomenal response in this patient. I am very encouraged by the findings, so I think there’s a story to come.”\n\n“Everything is turning around for me,” Young said. “I was very frightened when I started out. I'm not that frightened anymore. I know it still can turn for me, but I think I'm going to be the miracle that [Dr. Yuan] wants.”""]",The release is based on a very short-term observation of a single patient that received an experimental treatment. Reviewers found the release lacking in many criteria for a good news release.,"This news release highlights the “miracle” response of a single patient with triple-negative breast cancer to a drug combination that included an experimental cancer vaccine and a biosimilar of the drug pembrolizumab (marketed as Keytruda).
Far from objective, the release relies on strong emotional language such as “remarkable,” “miracle” and “shocking” to make the case for the drug combo instead of solid evidence and quantified benefits. The release also makes a pitch to breast cancer patients to become hospital clients, and to pharmaceutical companies to fund future clinical trials of the drug combo.
The release is premature. It’s based on a single case. There’s been no long-term follow-up and researchers say they don’t know which element of the treatment may have benefited the patient.

Dietary intake, mainly through sources such as vitamin D-fortified dairy products and juice, may add up to 200 to 400 units a day.\n\nHolick is convinced that if people boost their vitamin D levels, they\'ll be substantially less likely to develop not only osteoporosis but also many types of cancer, heart attack, diabetes (both types), autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer\'s, autism, even tuberculosis and the flu.\n\nNot so fast, other experts say.\n\nA Tricky Thing To Measure\n\nDr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women\'s Hospital, points out that nearly all of the proliferating studies involving vitamin D are what scientists call ""observational."" That is, they compare people with high and low levels of vitamin D and correlate those levels with whether or not the person has a disease.\n\nBut these studies, she points out, are fraught with possible error. People with higher vitamin D levels may be healthier because they exercise more, have better diets, are out in the sun more. Those who are sick may have low levels because they don\'t have those healthy habits.\n\n""We don\'t yet have the large-scale, randomized clinical trials showing benefits in terms of prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, cognitive decline, depression, autoimmune disease,"" Manson says.\n\nManson and her colleagues are launching such a trial. The National Institutes of Health is devoting $22 million for a five-year study. Twenty-thousand people across the country will be randomly assigned to take daily doses of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acid — also linked in many studies to lower levels of heart disease — together or alone. Others will be assigned to take inert placebo pills. Neither study subjects nor investigators will know until the end which regimen they are on.\n\n\'Promising But Not Yet Proven\'\n\nManson says she thinks there is promising evidence that vitamin D supplements may protect against heart disease and perhaps some cancers. The evidence is strongest for colorectal cancer, she says. The fact that the government is funding the study is an indicator that the idea has traction.\n\nUntil those results are in, Manson advises patients and doctors to view vitamin D claims as ""promising but not yet proven.""\n\n""We need to keep in mind the lessons of history,"" she says. ""It was believed that megadoses of vitamin E, beta-carotene, selenium, folic acid and the B vitamins would confer a large array of health benefits. And in fact, the trials were very disappointing for all those nutrients.""\n\nIn the case of beta-carotene, scientists were surprised to find that when the results of randomized trials were in, those taking the supplement actually had a higher risk of lung cancer.\n\nHolick and others say there is little or no downside to ingesting even high levels of vitamin D.\n\n""I\'ve been treating patients with 50,000 units of vitamin D once a week for eight weeks followed by 50,00 every other week for over a decade, and I\'ve not seen any untoward toxicity,"" Holick says.\n\nHe says he has seen dramatic results in patients he has treated with vitamin D supplements for disorders such as fibromyalgia, involving generalized muscular aches and pains, and multiple sclerosis. He is convinced that the vitamin D supplements lower patients\' risk of cancer and heart disease, although he acknowledges that\'s harder to show.\n\nHow Much Is Enough?\n\nHolick himself takes 3,000 international units of vitamin D every day.\n\nSet by the National Institute of Medicine in 1997, the current recommended intake is 400 units a day for adults ages 50 to 70, and 200 units a day for younger adults. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends 400 units a day for infants.\n\nThe recommendations may change soon. An Institute of Medicine panel is working on a vitamin D update, which may come out this summer. The panel may raise the Dietary Reference Intake, which has replaced the old Recommended Dietary Allowance. But the group is not expected to embrace the newer claims being made for vitamin D supplementation.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine panel has a difficult task. ""We don\'t know exactly where to draw the line in terms of calling someone deficient in vitamin D,"" says Manson, who is a member of the committee, as is Rosen, the Maine bone specialist.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of patients are getting their vitamin D levels tested, and more are being told they need to take supplements.\n\n""I\'ve been surprised at the number of patients who are significantly vitamin D deficient,"" says Dr. Elizabeth Ross, a cardiologist in Washington, D.C., who has been testing patients routinely for the past year. ""Whether or not we\'ll affect the incidence of cardiovascular disease or other diseases remains to be seen. But it appears to be a relatively benign intervention, and we may be benefiting people.""']","Good story pointing out that we have incomplete evidence about the health effects of vitamin D supplementation, and we are uncertain whom should be tested, and how much people should take.  Even the experts are at odds about it.","This story helps temper some of the rampant health claims made for vitamin D with information about the nature of the studies giving rise to the enthusiasm.  It is a step in the right direction for helping readers discern between health claims supported by actual clinical trials and those seen in observational studies.

This research demonstrates a novel method of treating this tumor without the toxicity of aggressive therapy that can also have late effects on the patient\'s health,"" said Tamarah J. Westmoreland, MD, PhD, a pediatric surgeon at Nemours Children\'s Health System and senior author of the study. ""Unique approaches to target tumor cells with nanoparticle delivery systems hold promise for treatment of resistant tumors, such as the high risk neuroblastoma. We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy.""\n\nNeuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than 5 years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities.\n\nCurcumin has been shown to have substantial anti-cancer ability, but its low solubility and poor stability have made its use in medicinal applications challenging. Researchers from Nemours and UCF found that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites.\n\n""This shows that nanoparticles can be an effective delivery vehicle for cancer drugs,"" said Professor Sudipta Seal, who directs of UCF\'s NanoScience Technology Center and Advanced Materials Processing Analysis Center, and is a collaborator on the study. ""More research is needed, but we are hopeful it could lead to more effective treatment of this devastating disease in the future.""\n\nIn the study, researchers loaded Cerium oxide nanoparticles with curcumin and coated them with dextran to test in cell lines of a high-risk form of neuroblastoma, known as MYCN-amplified, as well as non-amplified neuroblastoma. This formulation induced substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells. Overall, the nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCN-amplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies.\n\nNanoscience research, which explores the unusual properties of materials at the nanoscale, has led to advancements in medicine, energy, information storage, computing and other fields. At no more than 100 nanometers, nanoparticles are exceedingly small. By comparison, a sheet of paper is about 75,000 nanometers thick.\n\n###\n\nThis study was conducted in a laboratory setting in Orlando, Fla., at Nemours Children\'s Hospital and the University of Central Florida in cells from children with neuroblastoma, but researchers hope to begin to use these curcumin nanoparticles with micro RNA in animal models to direct the molecule to a tumor site. This research is an excellent example of the collaboration between Nemours Children\'s Hospital and the University of Central Florida. Funding of this work was supported by the Nemours Foundation along with the regional economic development initiative of the Florida High Tech Corridor.']","Curcumin-loaded nanoparticles may kill cancer in cell culture, but that may not always translate to clinical outcomes.","This University of Central Florida news release covers a study published in the journal Nanoscale, which found that curcumin-loaded nanoparticles kill neuroblastoma tumor cells in cell culture (in test tubes or petri dishes). Curcumin is a bright yellow compound found in the spice tumeric.
The news release doesn’t disclose any harms and quantitative data to back up its claims and, instead, uses only broad, ambiguous language when describing the treatment’s benefits. For example, researchers found that these molecules may induce “substantial” cell death in neuroblastoma cells without being toxic to healthy cells. The study’s limitations should have been emphasized — namely, that it’s early pre-clinical research with experiments only conducted in undefined cell lines.
In addition, research with curcumin-loaded nanoparticles isn’t exactly new. In 2012, a couple of studies looked at the molecule’s effects, including its toxicity, on neuroblastoma cells.

""But they also need to remain vigilant because they are at increased risk of cancers not detected on mammography that show up between mammograms.""\n\nIn their study, published in the Feb. 23 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Miglioretti and her colleagues found that false positives and interval cancers were both higher in women with a history of breast cancer than in those without such history. False positives are an initial finding of cancer that turns out to be benign based on additional testing. Interval cancers are those found between mammograms, either through additional tests or symptoms.\n\nThe researchers evaluated 12 years of data from 58,870 screening mammograms in 19,078 women with early-stage breast cancer and an equal number of mammograms in another 55,315 women who had never had breast cancer. The women were matched on such factors as age and breast density, a risk factor for cancer, with higher density increasing risk.\n\nWithin a year of the screening, 655 cancers were found in women with a breast cancer history and 342 in those without.\n\nMammograms had detected 76.5 percent of the cancers in women who had never had breast cancer and 65.4 percent in those who had previously had the disease. As for false positives, 1 percent of the women without a history of breast cancer were referred for biopsy but ended up being cancer-free, compared with 1.7 percent of those with a breast cancer history.\n\nThe interval cancer rate was 3.6 per 1,000 screenings in those with a history and 1.4 per 1,000 in those without, the investigators found.\n\nWomen with a history of breast cancer were also more likely to be called back for additional imaging or biopsies: 18 percent called back, compared with 8.3 percent of the others.\n\n""I think it\'s mostly positive news,"" Miglioretti said. ""Of the ones that are missed, most of them are early stage."" It points to the need, she said, for women to remain vigilant about screening after their breast cancer treatment -- and to report any symptoms to their doctor immediately.\n\nDr. William Audeh, medical director of the Samuel Oschin Cancer Center and the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, described the findings as ""not at all surprising."" He reviewed the study but was not involved in it.\n\nAfter surgery and radiation, he said, a woman\'s breasts have changed, and there is a greater chance that a radiologist will think that something is abnormal simply because of the changes. ""That helps explain the false positives,"" Audeh said.\n\nAnd though mammography did not catch all cancers in the women with a breast cancer history, the study still points out the value of the test, he said.\n\nRobert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society, agreed.\n\n""Despite poorer performance compared with women without a prior history of breast cancer, overall screening mammography was effective at detecting the majority of breast cancer in women with a [history] at an early favorable stage, with the majority of tumors being diagnosed as ductal carcinoma in situ or stage 1,"" Smith said.\n\nA trend among cancer specialists, Audeh said, is to tailor follow-up for a woman who has had breast cancer. For those who have dense breasts and are younger than 50, for example, ""we can alternate mammograms with breast MRIs,"" with one of the tests every six months, he said.\n\nMore information\n\nWomensHealth.gov has more on mammograms.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Gets off to a bad start with misleading headline: “Mammograms May Not Be Fool-Proof at Catching Second Cancers.”  No type of screening for breast cancer is fool-proof whether it is for an initial diagnosis or for a second breast cancer. </span>","Although the story addressed most of our criteria satisfactorily, it didn’t:

293,story_reviews_01523,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/2954/,2010-06-24 04:00:00,Promise Seen for Detection of Alzheimerâ€™s,"[""Ever since Alzheimer’s disease was described by a German doctor, Alois Alzheimer, in 1906, there was only one way to know for sure that a person had it. A pathologist, examining the brain after death, would see microscopic black freckles, plaque, sticking to brain slices like barnacles. Without plaque, a person with memory loss did not have the disease.\n\nThere is no treatment yet to stop or slow the progress of Alzheimer’s. But every major drug company has new experimental drugs it hopes will work, particularly if they are started early. The questions though, are who should be getting the drugs and who really has Alzheimer’s or is developing it?\n\nEven at the best medical centers, doctors often are wrong. Twenty percent of people with dementia — a loss of memory and intellectual functions — who received a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, did not have it. There was no plaque when their brains were biopsied. Half with milder memory loss, thought to be on their way to Alzheimer’s, do not get the disease. And with such a high rate of misdiagnosis, some who are mistakenly told that they have Alzheimer’s are not treated for conditions, like depression or low levels of thyroid hormone or drug side effects and interactions, that are causing their memory problems.\n\nBrain scans that showed plaque could help with some fundamental questions — who has or is getting Alzheimer’s, whether the disease ever stops or slows down on its own and even whether plaque is the main culprit causing brain cell death.\n\nDr. Skovronsky thought he had a way to make scans work. He and his team had developed a dye that could get into the brain and stick to plaque. They labeled the dye with a commonly used radioactive tracer and used a PET scanner to directly see plaque in a living person’s brain. But the technology and the dye itself were so new they had to be rigorously tested.\n\nAnd that is what brought Dr. Skovronsky, a thin and eager-looking 37-year-old, to his e-mail that recent day.\n\nFive years ago, Dr. Skovronsky, who named his company Avid in part because that is what he is, had taken a big personal and professional gamble. He left academia and formed Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, based in Philadelphia , to develop his radioactive dye and designed a study with hospice patients to prove it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHospice patients were going to die soon and so, he reasoned, why not ask them to have scans and then brain autopsies afterward to see if the scans showed just what a pathologist would see. Some patients would be demented, others not.\n\nSome predicted his study would be impossible, if not unethical. But the F.D.A. said it wanted proof that the plaque on PET scans was the same as plaque in a brain autopsy.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Avid study was designed to provide that proof. And the full results, contained in the e-mail message sent that day, May 14, were the moment of truth. When he saw them, Dr. Skovronsky said they were everything he had hoped for.\n\n“This is about as good as it gets,” he said that day.\n\nHe went into a rotunda that serves as Avid’s lunchroom to tell the company’s 50 employees. “This is a big day for us,” he continued. “I thought about what I would say, but I have totally forgotten it.”\n\nHis employees applauded. Then they had champagne in blue plastic cups.\n\nA First Dye\n\nThe type of scans used in this study, PET scans, are expensive and patients have to go to a scanning center, get injected with a radioactive dye, wait for the dye to reach their brain and then have a scan.\n\nOther tests are being studied — ones that look for amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain; MRI scans that look for shrinkage of the brain in areas needed for memory and reasoning; PET scans that look for uptake of glucose, a cellular fuel, to show areas where the brain was active and where it was not. The tests, though, were not necessarily specific for Alzheimer’s and none had been studied to see if they accurately predicted plaque on autopsy.\n\nEarlier this decade, two scientists at the University of Pittsburgh developed an amyloid dye that while not practical for widespread use, stunned scientists by showing it seemed possible to see amyloid in a living brain.\n\nThe researchers, Chester Mathis and William Klunk, began their work two decades ago, persevering even though they had no research money. In the first 10 years, they tested more than 400 compounds. When they finally found one that seemed promising, they tested more than 300 variations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“On and on it went,” Dr. Mathis said.\n\nFinally, in late 2001, they began working with collaborators in Sweden to test their dye in humans.\n\nOn Valentine’s Day 2002, the Swedish researchers injected the first Alzheimer’s patient with the dye, known as Pittsburgh Compound B, and scanned the patient’s brain.\n\nIt worked, the Swedish doctors told Dr. Mathis in an excited phone call.\n\nA PET scan showed amyloid exactly where it would be expected. The Swedish doctors were convinced they were seeing actual plaque. They told Dr. Mathis it was time to celebrate.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Dr. Mathis worried. What if the same pattern occurred in people without Alzheimer’s?\n\nTwo weeks later, he got another call from Sweden. His colleagues had scanned a person without Alzheimer’s. There was no sign of telltale plaques.\n\nHis sweet reward came in July 2002, when the scans were shown to an audience of 5,000 scientists at an international conference on Alzheimer’s.\n\n“There was an audible gasp,” Dr. Mathis said. “The field was taken aback.”\n\n“The rest is history,” he added.\n\nYet there was a problem. Pittsburgh Compound B used carbon 11 as its radioactive tracer. And its half-life is 20 minutes. Researchers have to make it in a cyclotron in the basement of a medical center, quickly attach it to the dye, dash over to a patient lying in a scanner, and inject it.\n\nAnd a critical question remained: Was a PET scan with the Pittsburgh dye really equivalent to a brain autopsy?\n\nMeanwhile, others, including Dr. Skovronsky, had another idea — use fluorine 18, with a half-life of about two hours. It could be made in the morning, and used that afternoon. And fluorine 18 is made routinely for two million cancer PET scans each year.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Skovronsky, starting at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Avid, worked with a University of Pennsylvania chemist, Hank Kung, for nine years to find and develop the radioactive dye. The university had the patent; Avid licensed it. Finally, on June 8, 2007, a patient at Johns Hopkins had a scan with their compound. Plaque lit up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost of the time, the scans were as expected — those with Alzheimer’s had lots of plaque, those with normal memories had little if any and those with mild memory impairment were in between.\n\nBut about 20 percent of people over 60 with normal memories had plaque.\n\n“Then we looked more carefully,” Dr. Skovronsky said. “The 20 percent who had amyloid, though they were still statistically in the normal range, did worse on every memory test than the control group.”\n\nWhat, Dr. Skovronsky asked, did that mean? Were they starting to develop Alzheimer’s? If so, could dementia be stalled if there were drugs to stop amyloid from accumulating?\n\nThe definition of Alzheimer’s is plaque plus memory loss and other symptoms of mental decline. But what is not known because no one could follow the development of plaque before a person died, was whether people with plaque and normal memories were developing Alzheimer’s.\n\n“We’ve always assumed the pathology has been there, that the plaque has been there years before symptoms,” said Dr. Steven T. DeKosky, an Alzheimer’s researcher who is vice president and dean at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. “But we never had a way to detect plaque in living persons,” he said. And so plaque in the brains of people with normal memories has been a puzzle.\n\n“Over the next couple of years, we will find out what it means.”\n\nA Request of the Dying\n\nOn Oct. 23, 2008, Avid and two other companies, Bayer and General Electric , that are developing fluorine 18-based dyes for amyloid scans, got a pointed question from an advisory committee to the F.D.A.: How do you know that what you are seeing on scans is the same as the amyloid you see on autopsy?\n\nIt seemed impossible to answer. If researchers wait for their subjects to die before comparing scans with autopsies they can be waiting a long time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Avid had a plan, and the committee agreed in principle that it would work. Hospice patients would be study subjects, some with dementia, some without. All would have memory tests and brain scans. After death, their brains would be autopsied. Avid suggested that after the first 35 died, there should be enough data to know if the scans gave a true picture of the pathology. Then the F.D.A. could decide if the results were convincing enough to approve the dye for marketing.\n\nSome doctors had misgivings, wondering how they could ask people who were sick and dying to be scanned just to help Alzheimer’s research. But, they found, most patients and their families agreed and said they were grateful to have been asked.\n\nThat was evident on May 19, when Dr. Skovronsky gave a lunch for patients’ families in Sun City, Ariz., to thank them for participating.\n\nThey thanked him.\n\n“It really touched my heart to be in this,” said Dorothy Wall, whose husband, Claude E. Wall, died of liver cancer in Sun City on March 3.\n\n“Something bad happens, and now something good happens.”\n\nAnswers\n\nLate last year, Avid saw the initial results of its hospice study — data from the first six patients. Then, as more patients were studied, the data from them were held by a company that would analyze it. Avid did not see the results until the study was completed. But those first six were encouraging.\n\nA man diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and cancer had a scan showing no plaque. His autopsy did not show it, either. The diagnosis was wrong. Another man with Parkinson’s disease and dementia had been diagnosed as having dementia solely due to Parkinson’s. His scan showed amyloid. So did the autopsy. He had Alzheimer’s. A woman with mild memory loss had a scan showing no amyloid. Her autopsy also found none. Three others had clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer’s, confirmed by scans and autopsies.\n\nFinally, on May 14, 35 patients had been scanned and autopsied. The Avid study was complete, and the full data will be presented at the meeting next month. Other companies, still doing their studies, did not yet have data to examine.\n\nAnd Dr. Skovronsky got that e-mail message.\n\n“This is going to have a big impact on Alzheimer’s disease, guys,” he told his staff that day.""]",A front page story based on a study that hasn’t even been presented yet much less published.  Feels like marketing for a test that is in the early stages of development. Maybe it’ll be a breakthrough but the story presents it as a near fait accompli. ,"This is a story that celebrates the ""eureka moment,"" so much so that it includes three eureka moments. The problem with eureka moments and with stories like this is that they don’t reflect the true nature of scientific discovery. Yes, scientists get excited about breakthroughs, as they should, but those breakthroughs are often quite a distance away from actual application in a clinical setting. This story spends too much time drum rolling for a presentation at meeting in Hawaii that is weeks away and not enough time explaining why this particular pathway for Alzheimer’s detection is worth pursuing over the many other lines of inquiry that are alluded to in the story.

Standard stroke treatment relies on powerful blood-thinning medications that break up the clot and restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nBut when those drugs don\'t work, doctors now can turn to a new catheter-based device that will physically remove the blood clot, said Dr. William Powers, lead author of the updated AHA guidelines and chair of neurology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe tool, called an endovascular stent retrieval device, is made up of wire mesh that resembles a tiny ring of chicken wire, Powers said.\n\nSkilled surgeons run the device up through a person\'s arteries via a catheter, and then open it smack in the middle of a stroke-causing blood clot.\n\n""If you actually deploy or open one in the middle of a clot, it smooshes out and the clot gets caught in the chicken wire, and then you pull the whole thing out back through the artery,"" Powers said.\n\nThe new guidelines were published June 29 in the journal Stroke.\n\nThe AHA issued its updated guidelines based primarily on the results of six new clinical trials released within the past eight months, Powers said. All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added.\n\nA number of other medical societies have endorsed the AHA\'s new guidelines, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology.\n\nAs with other stroke treatments, time is of the essence. The procedure must start within six hours of the onset of a stroke, which means that emergency teams and hospitals will have to move fast, Powers said.\n\nThe guidelines provide added incentive to quickly transfer stroke victims from a local hospital to a major stroke center capable of advanced treatment, said Powers and Dr. David Kandzari, director of interventional cardiology and chief scientific officer for the Piedmont Heart Institute in Atlanta.\n\nLocal hospitals currently are urged to ""drip and ship"" people experiencing a major stroke -- essentially, start an IV drip of the powerful clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and then ship them by ambulance or helicopter to the nearest comprehensive stroke center for further treatment, Kandzari said.\n\nStent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use.\n\n""These are procedures performed by very specialized individuals,"" Kandzari said. ""They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. Hospitals must make plans to get people to other centers that are capable of this catheter-based therapy,"" he explained.\n\nPowers said, ""I think what\'s going to happen is that we will develop systems of rapid triage and rapid transport. A lot of this at this point depends on logistics and manpower. The people who do this are specially trained. You need a lot of special training to get those catheters up into the brain and pull things out.""\n\nThe guidelines specifically recommend using a stent retrieval device for people who:\n\nDidn\'t have any significant disability prior to their current stroke.\n\nReceived tPA within 4.5 hours of their stroke onset, and can start the procedure within six hours after stroke symptoms started.\n\nAre at least 18 years old, as clinical trials have not been conducted with children.\n\nHave imaging scans that show more than half of the brain on the side of the stroke is not permanently damaged.\n\nHave a clot blocking a large artery supplying blood to the brain.\n\nThat last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said.\n\nThe major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.\n\nBut clinical trials have shown that the risk of brain bleeding for people who received tPA and then went through mechanical clot removal is no greater than for people who just receive the blood thinner, Powers said.\n\n""The outcomes were uniformly positive in all of the trials,"" he said. ""It\'s really, really good evidence.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about stroke, visit the National Stroke Association.']",This generally solid story about new guidelines for clot removal during strokes would have benefited from a few statistics describing the benefits.,"A Medtronic device used to remove clots during stroke.
This brief article explains why a certain subset of people who have strokes may be treated more effectively with a new procedure than with existing alternatives. The new procedure sends a thin wire tube through their blood vessels to the location of a clot in the brain and removes it. The story did an excellent job of listing the complex criteria required to find the patients for whom this procedure is now recommended. It could have provided more specifics about the benefits associated with the procedure and its costs. And one of the experts tapped for commentary is a paid consultant to companies who make the devices used in this procedure, and the story should have alerted readers to that fact. The new guidelines are the result of months of study by a committee of the American Heart Association.

Some of those cancers were in their earliest stages, when they’re more likely to respond to treatment.\n\nWhen the Johns Hopkins University researchers tested an alternative means of collecting cells — a longer brush that sweeps cells from the lining of the uterus — they positively identified endometrial cancer in 93% of cases and ovarian cancer in 45% of cases.\n\nAnd when they added a blood test to the ovarian cancer screening regimen, they were able to detect that deadly cancer in 63% of patients who had it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Having the possibility to detect these cancers earlier is very exciting,” said Dr. Nickolas Papadopoulos, a coauthor of the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nIt’s the latest example of how scientists hope to detect cancer earlier and with greater precision by looking in blood and other easily accessible fluids for cells that bear the telltale genetic mutations of cancer.\n\nWhile such “liquid biopsies” have not yet made their way into widespread use, they hold the promise of revolutionizing cancer screening.\n\nIn January, the same research team presented promising findings in the journal Science on a blood test called CancerSEEK that’s capable of detecting malignancies of the liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colon, lung and breast. Earlier this week, they published findings in the journal eLife on a urine test to detect cancers of the urothelial tract or urinary bladder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a screening test for cervical cancer, the Pap smear has been a staple of gynecological checkups for more than six decades. It’s named for Dr. George Papanicolaou, the physician who first showed that cancerous cells of the cervix could be detected by microscopic inspection.\n\nThe Pap test has dramatically driven down deaths from cervical cancer, which used to be one of the most common cancers in women. However, the test does a poor job of detecting endometrial or ovarian cancer, which together kills about 25,000 women in the United States each year.\n\nWomen thought to be at high risk of those cancers are sometimes screened with a blood test that detects an immune system biomarker called CA-125, or with a transvaginal ultrasound that looks for telltale thickening of the uterus’ endometrial wall. But those tests fail to detect many cancers, and also send up a lot of false alarms. So they’re frequently not used until a woman complains of symptoms.\n\nThe result is often a diagnosis at an advanced stage, when treatments are more invasive and less likely to be successful.\n\nTumor cells from ovarian and endometrial cancers shed and are carried into the uterine cavity and endocervical canal, where they can be collected with the Tao brush or the Pap brush. (Y. Wang et al. / Science Translational Medicine )\n\nIn the new study, the researchers measured the accuracy of their PapSeek test on 1,658 women. They already knew that 1,002 of the women were free of either cancer and 656 of them had either ovarian or endometrial cancer.\n\nResearchers collected cervical fluid samples with a Pap smear brush and a slightly longer tool called a Tao brush, which reaches beyond the cervix and into the uterus, nearer to where ovarian and endometrial cancers take hold. Then they used the PapSeek test to sequence the samples, focusing on 18 genes that tend to develop mutations in those cancers. The test also checked the samples for aneuploidy, the presence of abnormal numbers of chromosomes in cells.\n\nWhen the researchers used the longer Tao brush, they were able to detect endometrial cancer in all but 7% of the women who had the disease, and close to half of the ovarian cancers. Combined with the fact that these tests were performed with a mere swipe of the uterine wall, these measures of “sensitivity” — the ability to detect cancers that are actually there — represent a major improvement over the screening tests currently available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen they supplemented the analysis of Pap and Tao brush samples with a hunt for mutated cells in the women’s blood, they were able to detect ovarian cancer in well over half of those who had it.\n\nWhen endometrial and ovarian cancers are especially aggressive and when they have progressed to advanced stages, they are easier to find with existing screening methods. But an important measure of a test’s usefulness is whether it can detect the most aggressive types of cancer before they have metastasized.\n\nBy that measure too, the PapSeek test looked promising. When it was used to scan the Tao brush samples, it identified 89% of the high-grade endometrial cancers in patients while their malignancy was still confined to the endometrium. It was also able to identify 80% of those with high-grade ovarian cancers before they had spread.\n\nJust as important, the tests were remarkably good at avoiding false-positive signals, which would needlessly alarm women and lead to riskier and more-invasive tests to confirm a diagnosis. For both types of cancer, the PapSeek test’s “specificity” — its ability to accurately recognize the absence of disease — approached 100%.\n\nPapadopoulos said he was surprised and heartened that the Pap test — or a close variant of it — could be repurposed to look for gynecological cancers that are typically caught way too late.\n\nWhile the team hopes to improve the test’s sensitivity, he said that even this early version would likely boost women’s chances of earlier detection by a considerable margin.\n\n“It doesn’t have to be perfect to help at least some women” who might otherwise die of these stealthy cancers, Papadopoulos said. “Women are already used to having Pap smears, and everyone can give a vial of blood.”\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\n@LATMelissaHealy\n\nMORE IN SCIENCE\n\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch counts 1.8 trillion pieces of trash, mostly plastic\n\nTo avoid germs on an airplane, consider booking a window seat\n\nThe National Academies take a hard look at the safety and quality of abortion care in the U.S.']","The test aims to detect endometrial and ovarian cancers, which typically aren’t found until they’re advanced, limiting effective treatments options and contributing to the lethality.","This story by the LA Times covers a study of PapSeek, which is a new three-prong genetic test for Pap smear, inner-uterus smear, and blood samples.

The research team reports that the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy will spare thousands of patients each year in the United States alone from having to undergo unnecessary surgery.\n\nIn a recent report on ongoing work to improve kidney tumor classification, published in the April issue of the journal Clinical Nuclear Medicine, the team reports that the sestamibi SPECT/CT test—short for 99mTc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography(CT) — adds additional diagnostic information in conjunction with conventional CTs and MRI and improves physicians’ ability to differentiate between benign and malignant kidney tumors.\n\n“Sestamibi SPECT/CT lets radiologists and urologists ‘see’ the most common benign kidney tumor, something CT and MRI have not succeeded in doing alone,” says Mohamad E. Allaf, M.D., MEA Endowed Professor of Urology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “This noninvasive scan may prevent patients with a potentially benign kidney tumor from having to undergo a surgery to remove the tumor or potentially the entire kidney, along with its associated risks and high costs. At Johns Hopkins, use of this test has already spared a number of our patients from unnecessary surgery and unnecessary removal of a kidney that would require them to be on dialysis. These results are hugely encouraging, but we need to do more studies.”\n\nFor this study, 48 patients who were diagnosed with a kidney tumor on conventional CT or MRI were imaged with sestamibi SPECT/CT at Johns Hopkins prior to surgery. Radiologists, who were not allowed to talk to each other or know the results of the surgeries, graded the conventional and sestamibi SPECT/CT images benign or malignant using a 5-point scale (1 = definitely benign, 5 = definitely cancerous).\n\nFollowing surgery, similarly ‘blinded’ pathologists analyzed the tumors without knowing the radiologists’ imaging results. Pathology results of surgically removed tumors showed that 8 of the 48 were benign. The remaining 40 were classified as a variety of other tumor types, including malignant renal cell carcinomas.\n\nReviewing sestamibi SPECT/CT scan results in conjunction with CT or MRI changed the initial rating levels from cancerous (score 3, 4, 5) toward benign (score 1 and 2) in 9 cases, and changed reviewers’ score from likely cancerous (score 4) to definitely cancerous (score 5) in 5 cases, or about 10 percent of all cases. The addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased the reviewers’ diagnostic certainty in 14 of the 48 patients, or in nearly 30 percent of all cases.\n\nOverall, the investigators said, adding sestamibi SPECT/CT helped identify 7 of 9 benign tumors, and conventional imaging with added sestamibi SPECT/CT outperformed conventional imaging alone, as measured by a statistical analysis that measures tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. On this measure, a value of 0.50 indicates that a diagnostic test is no better than chance. Conventional imaging combined with sestamibi SPECT/CT had a value of 0.85, while conventional imaging alone had a value of 0.60.\n\nEven for patients whose tumors were not reclassified, the addition of sestamibi SPECT/CT increased physicians’ ability to more confidently classify malignant tumors, which reduces the risk of misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery for all patients, the researchers say.\n\nRadiologists and urologists have been frustrated for decades by the inability of conventional imaging tests, such as CT and MRI, to distinguish benign from malignant kidney tumors. At Johns Hopkins, multispecialty teams work together to determine the best care for patients and as partners on research innovations and quality improvement initiatives. “This collaborative venue enabled two then-residents [Drs. Michael Gorin and Steven Rowe] from different departments and specialties to design a clinical trial based on a few reports in the literature suggesting a potential role for sestamibi SPECT/CT in this diagnostic conundrum, and their hypothesis proved correct,” says Mehrbod Som Javadi, MD, assistant professor of radiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the senior author on the paper. Pamela T. Johnson, MD, associate professor of radiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine notes, “these types of advances are critical to our precision medicine initiative, Hopkins inHealth, designed for individualized patient management, and to our mission of high-value health care, where the highest quality care is safely delivered at the lowest personal and financial cost to the patient.”\n\n“As radiologists, we have struggled to find noninvasive ways to better classify patients and spare unnecessary surgery, but this has not been easy,” says Steven P. Rowe, M.D., Ph.D., one of the two former residents who developed this approach, and now assistant professor of radiology and radiological science at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “Sestamibi SPECT/CT offers an inexpensive and widely available means of better characterizing kidney tumors, and the identical test is now being performed as part of a large trial in Sweden, for which the first results have just recently been published and appear to confirm our conclusions.”\n\nAlthough further study is needed to validate the accuracy of sestamibi SPECT/CT, this test appears to be a less expensive, faster, noninvasive alternative to surgery, says Michael A. Gorin, M.D., the other resident involved in developing this approach and now chief resident with The James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “In the absence of diagnostic certainty, surgeons tend to remove kidney tumors in an abundance of caution, leading to an estimated 5,600 surgically removed benign kidney tumors each year in the United States.”\n\nOther authors on this paper include, Sara Sheikhbahaei, Christopher S. Jones, Kristin K. Porter, Alex S. Baras, Phillip M. Pierorazio, Mark W. Ball, Lilja B. Solnes, Jonathan I. Epstein, and Mehrbod S. Javadi, all of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Takahiro Higuchi of Wurzburg University in Germany.\n\nSEE ORIGINAL STUDY']",This release offers a good summary along with mentioning the need for a larger study to confirm the findings.,"This release from Johns Hopkins reports on a small, preliminary trial that shows adding a diagnostic imaging technique called sestamibi SPECT/CT to CT or MRI imaging tests led to more accurate diagnosis of kidney tumors, and subsequently, fewer unnecessary surgeries for benign tumors. Sestamibi SPECT/CT is short for 99mTc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography.
The release does many things very well, particularly in its discussion of the benefits of the technology and the study evidence. The release would have been even stronger with some more details of cost beyond saying it is inexpensive. Since the sestamibi SPECT/CT appeared to reduce the number of surgeries because of better tumor classification, it likely would be a huge cost savings to both patients and the health system.

314,story_reviews_00903,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/researchers-report-progress-in-cancer-immunotherapy/,2012-03-05 13:00:00,Researchers report progress in cancer immunotherapy,"['In a bid to make cancer immunotherapy more effective, researchers report they have succeeded in halting the progress of aggressive melanoma in its tracks — at least briefly — in seven patients treated with an army of cloned cancer-fighting immune cells. In one of those patients, the treatment resulted in complete remission of his metastatic melanoma and evidence that his immune system stands ready to fight any return of the cancer after three years.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, contributes to hopes that a tumor-fighting strategy called immunotherapy can slow, halt or even reverse the growth of a range of cancers — and do so with fewer dangerous side effects.\n\nImmunotherapy is one of medicine’s most promising — and most problematic — approaches to cancer treatment. It aims to charge up the patient’s immune system to attack cancer cells and halt their out-of-control growth.\n\nThe approach outlined in the new study by researchers from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle identifies several ways to make it better, said Dr. Cassian Yee, the study’s senior author. The key is to identify specific cancer-fighting cells already circulating in the blood of patients and make thousands of copies of them in the lab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis type of “adoptive immunotherapy” could be effective against a wide range of cancers, Yee said. His research group is making plans to try the technique on patients with advanced ovarian cancer and sarcomas — rare tumors that arise from connective tissue in bones and muscle.\n\nSeveral independent researchers said the study results were promising. But they also noted that the trial involved only 11 patients and said the therapy was less effective than in other published trials.\n\n“Someday, cell-based therapy will be mainstream in cancer therapy,” said Dr. Jeff Miller of the University of Minnesota’s cell therapy core laboratory. “Each article that shows clinical activity is giving us a piece of the puzzle” that will make it safer and more effective, he said.\n\nImmunotherapy usually starts with clinicians harvesting immune system cells called T cells that have attached themselves to a tumor in an effort to attack. They then coax the cells to multiply, either in the lab or in the body, and let them loose in the bloodstream so they can attack cancer wherever they find it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYee’s team tried to do this more precisely. The researchers hoped that by choosing T cells more selectively and cloning only those judged most likely to vanquish their foe, the treatment would be more effective. Sorting through the body’s vast and diverse population of T cells to select just the right ones is a painstaking process. But Yee bet that the extra effort would pay off with better results and fewer side effects.\n\nResearchers drew blood from patients and scoured it to find the rare type of immune cell — a melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell — that specifically homes in on proteins expressed by the cancer. Then they put their harvest — as few as a few hundred cells — into a test tube and cloned them, creating millions. The last step was to infuse the resulting army of cancer-fighting clones back into the patient.\n\nIn six of the 11 patients in the trial, the melanoma stopped progressing for 12 to 19 weeks. Another patient was declared in remission because his cancer ceased to spread and, after several months, disappeared altogether. Three years later, researchers continue to detect the presence of the cloned cells they infused into the patient, 61-year-old high school history teacher Gardiner Vinnedge of North Bend, Wash.\n\nFor six years, Vinnedge endured painful rounds of chemotherapy, only to have his melanoma return. The immunotherapy allowed him to return to work three weeks after treatments began. The only side effect, he said, was a raging rash that lasted for three days.\n\n“My back, my legs were just covered with a hot red rash,” Vinnedge said. “It meant the treatment was working — the war was on between my T cells and the melanin in my skin.” Now he says he is optimistic he may live to see retirement age, though he’s not sure he’ll ever stop teaching.\n\nFor immunotherapy to work, the manufactured T cells must survive for the months it takes to reach a tumor and dismantle it, as well as to round up migrating cancer cells and kill them. Currently, the T cells have limited staying power and often die off before their work is done. Doctors give them a boost by administering a growth factor called interleukin-2. But at high doses, it can cause dangerously low blood pressure, breathing problems, kidney failure and heart arrhythmias.\n\nYee’s group showed that by choosing T cells more selectively, patients can get by with much lower doses of interleukin-2, making the treatment less toxic.\n\nThe researchers also discovered another way to reduce their dependence on interleukin-2 — by selecting the most youthful T cells, which survived the longest when infused into patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Patrick Hwu of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston said the study “adds to the wealth of what we know” about using the body’s immune system to fight cancer. But immunotherapy pioneer Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg was highly critical of the methods and results.\n\n“Cloned cells don’t work,” said Rosenberg, who heads the National Cancer Institute’s tumor immunology section. In larger immunotherapy trials that used cultured cancer-fighting immune cells taken from patients’ tumors, Rosenberg and his colleagues achieved “durable and complete regression” in as many as 40% as patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. “These results,” he said, “are inferior.”\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com']","In general, this was a carefully researched and written piece. But we longed for a bit of historical perspective.","The piece felt top-heavy with words of “progress…more effective…complete remission (in one patient)…hopes,” etc.
Half-way through came this line: “Several independent researchers said the study results were promising. But they also noted that the trial involved only 11 patients and said the therapy was less effective than in other published trials.”
But the only detailed caveat came at the very end – from Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute.  What is so ironic is that while we were reading the piece, but before we got to Rosenberg’s quote, we actually reflected on the exuberant early news coverage of Rosenberg’s interleukin-2 research back in the 1980s – and how similar this felt.    Now, about this new work, Rosenberg is quoted as saying “Cloned cells don’t work.  These results are inferior.” It would have been easy to pull out news coverage of the IL-2 work (such as the Newsweek cover story in 1985) and help readers think about similarities.
So, while we applaud the overall work of this story, we wished for a bit more historical perspective. Journalists and the public should remember Santayana’s quote:  “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

For decades, doctors have treated it with medications designed to keep blood sugar levels down.\n\nBut in a paper published in the Lancet, researchers in the UK describe a landmark study in which people with diabetes went into remission—just by losing weight.\n\nNearly half of people in the study who were given a six-month diet plan and lost an average of 30 pounds went into remission and no longer had diabetes. None took any medications during that time to control their disease and relied on weight loss alone.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nType 2 diabetes is caused by the body’s in ability to break down sugars from the diet. Normally, cells in the pancreas work to release insulin, a hormone that can process sugar and either send it to cells that need it for energy or store it as fat for future energy needs. Cells in the liver are responsible for clearing insulin from the circulation. But excess fat in the pancreas and liver can start to shut down these insulin-producing cells, leading to spikes in blood sugar levels. Diabetes medications can bring sugar levels down but do not address the compromised insulin machinery.\n\nIn the study, Dr. Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University, and his colleagues randomly assigned nearly 300 people to either a weight management program or their usual treatments, including diabetes medications. All of the people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the six years preceding the study. The people assigned to the diet group stopped any diabetes drugs they were taking on the same day they began the diet.\n\nThe diet, which was designed to help people lose up to 30 pounds, involved three to five months of a strict low-calorie liquid formula diet averaging no more than 850 calories a day, followed by two to eight weeks of reintroducing food, along with nutritional education and cognitive behavioral therapy to help people stick with the new eating plan.\n\nTaylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss, diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver. After a year, most of the people in the diet group lost about 22 pounds, compared to two pounds in the control group. Nearly a quarter of the people who managed their weight were able to lose 33 pounds or more, while none in the control group were able to lose that much. Most importantly, 46% of the people in the diet group went into remission with their diabetes, compared to just 4% in the control group.\n\nMORE: Antibiotics Are Linked To Type-2 Diabetes\n\n“People newly diagnosed with diabetes for the first time can look at this and know it isn’t necessarily for life,” says Taylor. “It isn’t an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from — at the moment, people are told that.”\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program in the U.S. revealed in 2002 that diet and exercise alone can prevent people from progressing from pre-diabetes to diabetes, in some cases better than medications designed to control blood sugar. Gastric bypass surgery, which can result in dramatic weight loss, can also help to reverse diabetes, but the procedure is costly and carries a high risk of complications.\n\nThe current study takes that work a step further and shows that it’s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed. Taylor stresses that the study only addressed people diagnosed relatively recently — within the past six years — and that the effect may not apply to more long-term patients. That’s because as the disease continues, he says, insulin-producing cells start to die off. Initially, the cells slowly shut down, entering a so-called resting state. Those are the cells that weight loss can re-activate.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Studies suggest that people living with diabetes for more than 10 years, for example, may not be able to rely on weight loss alone to push them into remission.\n\nThat points to an important lesson that Taylor hopes doctors and patients will learn from the results. He says that it’s critical to discuss from the start — when people are diagnosed with diabetes — the possibility of using diet and weight loss to treat their disease. If more people can benefit from losing weight alone, then that would mean less cost to the health care system, as fewer people will suffer the serious complications of advanced disease, which can include heart problems, neuropathy, vision issues and even amputations.\n\nTaylor says he intends to follow up on the people in the study for another four years to see if they are able to maintain their weight, and, if they are, whether they continue to remain in remission. “From the very clear data we produced in this trial, yes, this is a watershed moment for diabetes,” he says. “We can offer people hope from the start.”\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]","To its credit, the story competently describes the study methods and findings.","This Time story reports a study about reversing recently diagnosed diabetes via substantial weight loss.

The advanced form of radiation therapy (RT) was well tolerated among this relatively understudied elderly population, indicating that SBRT is a viable option for patients who may otherwise be offered no curative treatment.\n\nWhile the primary treatment for early stage lung cancer is surgical removal of the tumor, some patients may not be able to tolerate surgery due to health status, advanced age or other factors. For these patients, the best curative option is SBRT, a specialized type of external beam RT that uses advanced imaging techniques to deliver extremely targeted radiation to a tumor. This high degree of precision makes SBRT particularly effective at sparing surrounding healthy tissue, which is important for tumor sites near essential organs, such as the heart and lungs. Patients complete SBRT treatment in three to five days, compared with several weeks for conventional RT.\n\n“While multiple studies and trials have established the effectiveness of SBRT for inoperable early-stage lung cancer, one of the common reasons for not giving radiation in older patients is concern about tolerating the treatment and potential side effects,” said Richard J. Cassidy III, MD, lead author of the study and a resident in radiation oncology at Emory University’s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta. “The low rates of side effects from SBRT for this elderly population in our study indicate that these concerns should not prevent physicians from considering definitive treatment for their inoperable octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with early stage lung cancer.”\n\nFindings are based on a retrospective analysis of 58 consecutive patients who received definitive lung SBRT across four academic sites within Emory between 2010 and 2015. All patients were age 80 or older at the time of their diagnosis, with a median age of 84.9 years. Forty percent of the tumors were adenocarcinomas, while 29 percent were squamous cell carcinomas and 31 percent did not have a biopsy. Fifty percent of patients who did not have a biopsy had a previous history of lung cancer. Researchers used logistic regression and proportional hazard testing to determine the association of patient, tumor and treatment characteristics to compare rates of survival, recurrence and progression and assess the influence of patient and disease characteristics. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted to determine which patients were most likely to benefit from therapy.\n\nAt two years following definitive SBRT for lung cancer among elderly patients, survival rates were 73 percent for cancer specific survival (CSS) and 57 percent for overall survival (OS). CSS rates were higher for patients who were not active smokers but lower for patients who were older or had a previous lung cancer diagnosis (smoking Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.14, p = 0.03; age HR = 1.19, p = 0.04; cancer HR = 7.75, p = 0.01). OS rates were higher for patients with higher Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), which measures a patient’s functional ability to perform ordinary tasks, such as work and self-care (HR = 0.91; p < 0.01). Researchers determined that this metric should be considered when offering SBRT in this elderly population, with certain performance status criterion (i.e., KPS ≥ 75) associated with significantly improved outcomes. Two-year estimates of local control and regional control were 84.5 percent and 71.7 percent, respectively. Local failure was more common among patients with adenocarcinomas (HR = 6.36, p = 0.01) and less common for patients with T1 tumors (HR = 0.20, p < 0.01). Higher KPS scores were associated with lower rates of both local failure (HR = 0.92, p < 0.01) and regional failure (HR = 0.94, p < 0.01). In terms of toxicity, just over one-third of patients (34.5%) experienced radiation pneumonitis of any grade, with only two patients experiencing grade 3+ pneumonitis. Pneumonitis was more frequent among patients who were not actively using ace-inhibitors (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.49, p = 0.02) and less frequent in smaller tumors (OR = 0.03, p < 0.01).\n\n“Our study, along with other studies, helps to show that SBRT can effectively and safely add years to the lives of elderly patients who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation for it,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Elderly patients, who are otherwise doing well, should not have treatment withheld based solely on concerns about side effects and age.”\n\nThe abstract, “Stereotactic body radiotherapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer in patients 80 years and older: A multi-center analysis,” will be presented in detail during the poster session at the 2017 Multidisciplinary Thoracic Cancers Symposium in San Francisco (full details below).

The release, which summarizes a study of patients 80 or older who underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early stage lung cancer, should have stuck to what the researchers actually studied. In the headline, main text and quotes, the release makes unjustified claims about treatment effectiveness, claiming SBRT can “safely add years to the lives of elderly patients who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation for it.”
However, the study was merely a look back at a few dozen cases that produced results the researchers considered evidence that age, by itself, should not disqualify patients. There was no comparison group that would allow any conclusions about effectiveness, including longer survival. The release does not mention cost nor does it report funding or author disclosures.

Forty-six of the infants had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder, while the other 33 had no family history of autism.\n\nChildren who have a sibling with autism are much more likely to develop autism themselves, explained lead study author William Bosl, a neuroinformatics researcher at Children\'s Hospital Boston. Prior research has shown that about 20 percent of siblings of children with autism will also develop autism and another 40 to 50 percent will have some characteristics of the disorder, such as repetitive behaviors or problems with social interaction, language or communication, but not the full-blown disorder.\n\nWhile the children watched people blowing bubbles, researchers measured the babies\' brain waves and analyzed the results using computer algorithms. The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained.\n\nWhen the babies were nine months old, researchers could predict who was in the high-risk autism group -- that is, they had a sibling with autism -- with nearly 80 percent accuracy.\n\n""In this study, we have taken the first step in showing that there is definitive information in the electrical signals measured by EEG to distinguish normal controls from infants at high risk for developing autism,"" Bosl said.\n\nWhen broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. For example, at nine months they were able to predict which boys were in the high-risk group with near 100 percent accuracy. But accuracy for girls at that age was only 60 percent, not statistically significant.\n\nAt six months of age, however, they could predict the high risk girls with about 80 percent accuracy, though they couldn\'t do the same for boys that young.\n\n""It seems perhaps they are on a slightly different developmental trajectory,"" Bosl said.\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 22 in BMC Medicine.\n\nEEGs measure brain electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp. The technology has been around for awhile -- developed in the late 1920s, it has been used for more than 60 years to detect seizures in epileptics.\n\nBut it\'s the newer, artificial intelligence technology and sophisticated computer algorithms that enabled the researchers to look more deeply into what the EEGs show, Bosl said.\n\n""Artificial intelligence gives us the ability to find patterns we might not find with our own eyes,"" Bosl said. ""One of the difficulties with a disorder like autism is that it\'s very heterogenous. A very high-functioning person with autism might not be so different from a so-called \'normal\' person who is quirky. Defining the differences may be somewhat subtle.""\n\nEEGs are also relatively inexpensive, painless and safe, Bosl said. And unlike MRIs, they require no sedation, so testing could be put to widespread use, he said.\n\n""My hope is we would have a simple way of measuring brain activity in every child and see the patterns emerging that might track autism characteristics,"" Bosl said. ""That would be tremendously useful. We know early intervention is extremely important. Right now, for a lot of children, that means 3 years old. What we don\'t know yet is if you can intervene at 9 or 12 months and how effective that could be.""\n\nDr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated.\n\nAlso, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it\'s unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted.\n\n""If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection,"" Ewen said. ""Early detection continues to be of critical importance, as it opens the door to early intervention, which has been shown to improve outcomes for children with autism.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Neither this story nor a <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3665"" target=""_blank"">competing CNN story</a> on the same topic — a small study promising a new way of reading brain scans to detect risk factors for autism — probed deeply enough to help readers make sense of the study.</span>","This story, though, did a particularly poor job in large part because it allowed the lead author of the study to promote the idea that this might lead to a scan to be used on all children. The story did this despite the fact that it did very little to evaluate the quality of the evidence behind the study, presented no quantification of the potential harms associated with screening and tossed aside the issue of cost by claiming that scans — even for every kid in the country — would be “relatively inexpensive”.

Those who exercised to piano music also showed improvements in balance and the manner or style of walking.\n\n“Each year, one-third of the population 65 years and older experiences at least one fall, and half of those fall repeatedly,” write researcher Andrea Trombetti, MD, of University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine of Geneva, Switzerland, and colleagues in the Archives of Internal Medicine. “Exercise can counteract key risk factors for falls, such as poor balance, and consequently reduce risk of falling in elderly community-dwelling individuals.”\n\nResearchers say a large proportion of falls in elderly people occur while walking, so improving gait and balance can have a major impact on fall prevention.""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">He/she who lives by (and repeats what’s in) the journal news release, repeats the same flaws as the journal news release.</span>","

This story parrots the fundamental error of a journal news release about a trial of an exercise program intended to improve the walking ability and reduce falls among older people. The release and this story claim that “exercising to piano music” appears to reduce falls, but the trial did not actually test that hypothesis. The trial randomized participants to either a series of exercise classes or to continuing their usual activities, so all it can say is that class participation appeared to offer benefits. As the researchers wrote in their journal article, they could “only speculate on the factors responsible.”
 
On a side note, the New York Times may want to claim credit for a huge scoop on reporting about the potential benefits of this type of exercising to music. It published a story on these classes almost 97 years ago.

""We set out to discover whether there were chemical indicators detected in sweat that could complement the gold standard for CF diagnosis: the sweat chloride test.""\n\nThe test is commonly used in universal newborn disease-screening programs and measures the concentrations of salt. Elevated sweat chloride confirms that an infant actually has CF.\n\nBut there are some obstacles that complicate clinical decision-making, explains Britz-McKibbin, because sweat chloride can result in ambiguous diagnoses in some borderline cases and does not reveal how the disease might progress for individual patients.\n\n""Sweat contains lots of information related to human health that researchers have not fully analyzed and we found some unexpected chemicals associated with CF,"" he says.\n\nUsing a specialized technique developed at McMaster, scientists collected and analyzed sweat samples from infants in CF clinics at the McMaster Children\'s Hospital and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.\n\nThey identified several unknown chemicals beyond chloride that were consistently associated with babies who had CF, including two different drug and environmental compounds the infants secreted in sweat at much lower concentration levels.\n\nTesting for these biomarkers could be done in cases in which the chloride sweat test result is unclear, say researchers. The biomarkers also point to other underlying mechanisms that contribute to the progression of CF and could lead to better therapeutic interventions earlier in life.\n\n""The easier it is to detect CF, the earlier it can be diagnosed, and the better people\'s chances are at living a longer, healthier life"", says Joanna Valsamis, Chief Healthcare, Research and Advocacy Officer at Cystic Fibrosis Canada. ""CF Canada invests heavily in research that aims to improve the lives of people living with CF, and findings such as those from Dr. Britz-McKibbin are crucial to our understanding of the disease.""\n\nIn Canada, one in every 3,600 children are diagnosed with CF. But life expectancy rates have risen dramatically in recent decades with the median age of survival now over 50 years, due to better treatments to improve lung function, better nutrition and lung transplants. Further benefits are expected with the advent of newborn screening programs that have resulted in early detection.\n\n###\n\nThe research was funded in part by Cystic Fibrosis Canada. Since 1960, CF Canada has invested more than $244 million in leading CF research and care.']",The release’s headline and some of its language focuses on CF treatment while the study was about new biomarkers for diagnosis.,"This news release focuses on a recent study that found new biomarkers in the sweat of infants that are associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). The news release does a good job of explaining how these biomarkers may be valuable in helping to diagnose borderline cases of CF, in which conventional diagnostic techniques leave some uncertainty about whether an infant has the disease. However, in spite of speculation and a suggestive headline, there is little explanation of how the new findings could possibly affect treatment for CF patients — which is a significant oversight, given that the headline focuses on CF treatment, not diagnosis.

Participants were reassessed annually for three years following their studies. More than 90 percent of the participants displayed a significant increase in cognitive capacity, compared with 56 percent in a control group of 100 participants who didn\'t take any college courses.\n\n""The study findings are exciting because they demonstrate that it\'s never too late to take action to maximize the cognitive capacity of your brain,"" said lead researcher Megan Lenehan, PhD. ""We plan to follow these participants as they age to see if college studies could help delay the onset or reduce the debilitating effects of dementia.""\n\nPrevious studies have examined how exercise, brain games and an active social life may boost cognitive capacity and possibly stem cognitive decline associated with aging. This study is the first to examine similar positive effects from college courses taken by older adults, said Lenehan, of the University of Tasmania.\n\nThe study participants, who were screened to exclude people who had dementia, completed a baseline series of tests to measure cognitive capacity, or an individual\'s ability to use brain networks efficiently in areas such as memory, information processing, decision making and planning. The participants in the college studies group took a wide range of courses, including history, psychology, philosophy and fine art. Most of the students took courses on campus, but some completed online classes. The researchers suspect that campus study may provide greater benefits in boosting cognitive capacity because of social interaction with professors and fellow students, but the study didn\'t analyze any differences between on-campus or online courses.\n\nThe participants completed the same cognitive tests each year during the four-year study, with 92 percent of the college-studies group displaying a significant increase in cognitive capacity, while the remaining 8 percent generally maintained their cognitive capacity. For the control group, 56 percent displayed a significant increase in cognitive capacity, while 44 percent had no change. The participants\' age, gender, feelings of well-being or level of social connectedness didn\'t affect the findings. The research was published online in the journal Neuropsychology.\n\nPrior research has shown that college study earlier in life may increase cognitive capacity, and it appears the same may be true for older adults, Lenehan said.\n\n""It is possible that any mentally stimulating activity later in life may also enhance cognitive capacity, such as other adult-education classes or programs to increase social interaction,"" she said.\n\nThe control group was significantly older than the college studies group, but there were no significant differences in baseline cognitive capacity scores, the study noted. The researchers also didn\'t find any correlation between age and cognitive capacity scores at any point during the study. Some participants in the control group may have been doing crossword puzzles or other mentally stimulating activities that boosted their cognitive capacity, Lenehan said.\n\nThe participants who took college classes volunteered for the study so they probably had a greater interest in continuing education that the general senior population, the journal article noted. The study was too short to reveal any long-term effects so the researchers plan to follow the participants as they age to provide additional evidence of whether college studies may reduce the risk or delay the onset of dementia.\n\n###\n\nArticle: ""Sending Your Grandparents to University Increases Cognitive Reserve: The Tasmanian Healthy Brain Project;"" Megan E.

Did they make a noticeable difference?","Australian researchers report that a greater proportion of a group of older people who participated in university studies for at least 12 months over a four-year period performed better on measures of cognitive capacity, or cognitive reserve, which is associated with reduced risk of dementia, than a control group who didn’t participate in university studies (92% vs. 56%). The authors note that those in the control group likely did their own versions of mentally stimulating activities, as they self-selected by enrolling in a study on the topic. The differences between the groups may have been greater had participants been somehow blinded to the intent of the study.
While this American Psychological Association news release is informative overall and mostly avoids the hyperbole that we often find in descriptions of similar studies, there were some missed opportunities to inform.

He\'s an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia.\n\n""There is a tremendous lack of kidneys for transplant,"" he explained. ""Because of the opioid crisis, there are many people who die from a drug overdose and have HCV and want to donate their organs.""\n\nBut these infected kidneys are discarded, even though they are otherwise healthy. And many are from younger people, Reese said.\n\nOf roughly a half-million patients in the United States who were on dialysis for late-stage kidney disease in 2016, only 19,000 received kidney transplants. This is partly due to organ shortages, researchers have reported. And the average wait time for a non-infected kidney is more than two years, compared to eight months for an HCV-infected kidney.\n\nNew, less toxic treatments for hepatitis C opened the door for transplanting infected kidneys and then successfully treating the infection, Reese said.\n\nIn a study of 20 uninfected patients, researchers found that transplanting infected kidneys and then treating recipients for HCV resulted in a 100 percent cure rate. Half were evaluated six months after their transplant and the others a year after.\n\n""And we found that these kidney transplants were working as well as kidney transplants from uninfected patients,"" Reese said.\n\nThe potential cost savings could be significant, he added. Dialysis can cost more than $88,000 a year, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nThough some patients might not want to take the risk associated with an infected kidney, others might consider it a good option, given the high death rates for dialysis patients awaiting transplants, the researchers suggested.\n\nThe report was published online Aug. 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nDr. Adnan Sharif, a consultant transplant nephrologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, wrote an accompanying editorial.\n\nSharif said the excellent short-term outcomes and 100 percent cure rate of HCV in organ recipients should prompt transplant centers to rethink use of HCV-infected kidneys.\n\n""We must be bold in our approach to utilizing HCV kidneys,"" he said.\n\nSharif acknowledged, however, that using HCV-infected kidneys would represent ""a significant shift in our attitude to risk, procurement of organs and counseling potential recipients appropriately about the risks -- albeit minimal.""\n\nBut the cost effectiveness of using these kidneys versus remaining on dialysis would be significant, he noted.\n\nAnother study, published in the same journal in July, reported similar success in transplants of HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients. About 15 percent of dialysis patients have HCV, the researchers said.\n\nSharif said other organs from HCV-infected donors, such as hearts and lungs, might also be safely transplanted, expanding those organs\' supply, as well.\n\n""Using such donors could lead to many life-saving or enhancing transplants,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about kidney transplants, visit the National Kidney Foundation.']",Conflicts of interest also weren’t mentioned–and they were notable in this case.,"This story reported on a study that showed 20 dialysis patients who were transplanted with kidneys infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and subsequently treated for the virus fared as well as patients who received non-infected kidneys. The study concluded that kidneys from HCV-infected donors “may be a valuable transplant resource.”
The story explained the novelty of using organs that might otherwise get thrown away. But it skipped over questions about availability, potential risks, and study limitations. Conflicts of interest also weren’t mentioned–and they were notable in this case.

But the new finding indicates it could also be a valuable add-on treatment to surgery if the cancer returns.\n\nAndrogens, including testosterone, are thought to contribute to the growth and development of prostate cancer. Among men whose cancer showed signs of coming back after their prostate was surgically removed, adding a drug that blocks androgen receptors to radiation treatments halved their death rate from prostate cancer over the subsequent 12 years.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe findings should trickle down to clinical settings “pretty quickly,” said Dr. William Shipley, chair of the genitourinary oncology unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and one of the researchers behind the study, which was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nProstate cancer recurrence happens in about 30 percent of patients after surgery. In these cases, radiation therapy is usually used.\n\nThe specific ADT drug used in the study, bicalutamide, has since been largely replaced by another kind of drug that decreases the amount of testosterone the body produces. The effect of the newer-generation medications, gonadotropin-releasing hormones, is similar to bicalutamide, according to other trials.\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN), which is one of the makers of bicalutamide, was a sponsor of the study, and one of Shipley’s coauthors has received honoraria and grants from the company.\n\nBecause prostate cancer can progress relatively slowly, the study — which ran from 1998 to 2003 — needed an extended follow-up period to be sure of the effects, Shipley said. The men in the trial received the ADT drugs for two years.\n\nThe study represents an important, if incremental, step for clinicians, noted Dr. William See, chair of the urology department at the Medical College of Wisconsin, who wasn’t involved in the study. “It really builds on some prior data and combines prior findings to ask and answer a new question that is quite relevant for men affected by prostate cancer.”\n\nSome patients benefitted from adding the drugs more than others. The results were especially dramatic for men who had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels above .07 ng/ml when they started the trial. (While that is a relatively low level for most men, PSA levels should be close to zero after a prostatectomy.) Men with medium-grade tumors and those who may not have had their entire cancer removed during surgery also survived significantly longer if they received the drug.\n\nHowever, See and Shipley both noted that looking at those subsets of patients was not what the study was initially designed to do, which limits the statistical power of those conclusions. More research will be needed to confirm which men benefit most from taking the drug.\n\n“You don’t want to treat a patient if he doesn’t need to be treated,” Shipley said.']","But, the story does a good job of succinctly describing what is novel about this study and for which patients it may be relevant.","This story by STAT covers a study of a treatment for prostate cancer that comes back after initial rounds of surgery and radiation. The treatment is hormone blocking, or androgen deprivation therapy, and its side effects are significant. In this review, we’ll occasionally compare the coverage to The New York Times’ story about the same study (see that story review here), since it highlights a few important ways reporters and their outlets deviate in their coverage of important research.
Here, STAT does a good job of succinctly describing what is novel about this study and for which patients it may be relevant. It also was very clear on who funded the research.
Its main shortcoming is that while it does a good job of presenting the results as an incremental step forward, it presents results in relative terms rather than absolute (read here why that matters). It states that the study decreased death rates by half (50%) rather than saying that survival was improved by 5% (76% vs. 71%). This is a clear example of how presenting relative versus absolute outcomes can skew one’s interpretation of a study’s results. The Times (link) handled this better.

Dr. Budoff also has received honoraria from Wakunaga.\n\nAbout LA BioMed']","Just like it did in 2014 when first announced, this release makes over-reaching claims about garlic and heart health, a heavily researched topic.","This release reports on a study looking at the effects of taking daily doses of a readily available garlic supplement on the buildup of so-called soft plaque in coronary arteries. After one year of supplementation the rate of accumulation of this plaque had been reduced by 80%, according to the release. Our greatest concern with the release is its unsubstantiated claims about the benefits and the serious conflicts of interest (plural) at play. The paper discussed in the release was published as a paid supplement to the Journal of Nutrition and presented at a symposium sponsored primarily by commercial interests from the nutrition industry.
[Editor’s note: In this review, we characterize the garlic study as being “not yet available” (see below under “Why This Matters”) because the release described the study as “scheduled to be published.” Our reviewers felt that the release’s description was explicit about the fact that the study was not published — and that if it had been published, the release should have noted this. An official from the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute contacted us to clarify that the study was in fact published and available at the time the release was issued. We are passing this information along to readers.]

When the mothers’ DNA was reanalyzed, researchers said, the anomalies were linked to cancer in each of the women.\n\nResearchers said the report, presented Monday at a meeting of the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis in Washington, D.C., underscores both challenges and opportunities for the tests, which have altered the prenatal testing landscape since they first hit the market in 2011.\n\nRelated JAMA study\n\nThe noninvasive prenatal blood tests can detect evidence of fetal abnormalities in the blood of a pregnant woman. That enables doctors to determine whether a fetus is at risk for such genetic abnormalities as Down syndrome with a blood test rather than with more invasive amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling that can, in rare cases, induce miscarriages.\n\nBut as the new study shows, the unique ability to analyze both maternal and fetal DNA at the same time can lead to surprising results. “When the test first came out we didn’t think about cancer being a possibility,” said Diana Bianchi, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center, Boston. “I’ve been working in this field for 25 years, and it’s something that we never expected to find.”\n\nDr. Bianchi is lead author of the study, which was also published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nWhile the noninvasive tests are considered highly accurate, Dr. Bianchi said the new findings underscore the need to have any positive result confirmed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling diagnostic test before considering whether to terminate a pregnancy or to plan for a child with developmental disabilities.\n\n“Most of the time, the results do confirm the screening test,” she said, but it is possible the initial result “may have nothing to do with the fetus.”\n\nThe tests are recommended only for women considered at high risk of carrying fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities, but they have been rapidly adopted by clinicians and patients. Since they first came on the market in 2011, more than 2 million tests have been performed world-wide, Dr. Bianchi said.\n\nLeading marketers of the tests are Illumina Inc., which funded the study, and Sequenom Inc., both in San Diego.\n\nThe eight cases in the study came from a database of more than 125,000 blood samples submitted to Illumina between 2012 and 2014, of which 3,757, or 3%, were positive for at least one chromosomal abnormality associated with Down syndrome and other conditions. Among the very small number of instances where follow-up tests showed the fetus was normal, doctors later reported 10 cases of cancer.\n\nAmong the eight women studied, three had their cancers diagnosed because of the abnormal findings. “These women said they feel like their babies saved their lives because that was the finding that prompted the additional workup and treatment,” Dr. Bianchi said.\n\nUnanticipated results from genetic tests, known as incidental findings, are the subject of ongoing debate among genetics experts and clinicians about the ethics of whether and how to divulge such information to patients. For instance, if a genetic test for a childhood disease turned up evidence of an elevated risk for breast cancer later in life, there is no consensus on when or how to inform the patient.\n\nIn the case of maternal cancer, “this is a very interesting incidental finding because it’s something that potentially you need to take immediate action about,” Dr. Bianchi said.\n\nThe full implications of the new findings need further study, said Roberto Romero, a perinatology researcher at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and colleagues in an editorial accompanying the study. With the growing popularity of the noninvasive tests, there is increased need “to provide informed advice to potentially affected pregnant women” and to help guide their care, they said.\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com']","Going beyond the individual stories of the women whose cancers were detected by prenatal testing, this WSJ piece explores the underlying study data as well as the ethical and social issues raised by the research.","This Wall Street Journal story offers a thoughtful and thorough summary of a presentation (and related study in JAMA) about the ability of commercial prenatal blood tests to also uncover hidden cancers in pregnant women. The story makes clear that the study’s finding of “rare cases” of cancer “underscores both challenges and opportunities” for the tests, particularly those related to the tests’ potential to reveal elevated risks for future diseases. Other stories, including one from CBS News, focused more viscerally on the handful of mothers whose hidden cancers were detected by the fetal blood work. While stories focusing on such vignettes may pack a significant emotional punch, they also may leave readers with an exaggerated sense of these tests’ cancer-finding ability and the risk that most women face. As demonstrated by the WSJ coverage, there are many ethical and social issues raised by widespread DNA testing that also merit discussion.

Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe study will be published online February 1, 2016 in Pediatrics.\n\n""Previous studies of fiber intake and breast cancer have almost all been non-significant, and none of them examined diet during adolescence or early adulthood, a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,"" said Maryam Farvid, visiting scientist at Harvard Chan School and lead author of the study. ""This work on the role of nutrition in early life and breast cancer incidence suggests one of the very few potentially modifiable risk factors for premenopausal breast cancer.""\n\nThe researchers looked at a group of 90,534 women who participated in the Nurses\' Health Study II, a large long-running investigation of factors that influence women\'s health. In 1991, the women--ages 27-44 at the time--filled out questionnaires about their food intake, and did so every four years after that. They also completed a questionnaire in 1998 about their diet during high school. The researchers analyzed the women\'s fiber intake while adjusting for a number of other factors, such as race, family history of breast cancer, body mass index, weight change over time, menstruation history, alcohol use, and other dietary factors.\n\nBreast cancer risk was 12%-19% lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in early adulthood, depending on how much more they ate. High intake of fiber during adolescence was also associated with 16% lower risk of overall breast cancer and 24% lower risk of breast cancer before menopause. Among all the women, there was a strong inverse association between fiber intake and breast cancer incidence. For each additional 10 grams of fiber intake daily--for example, about one apple and two slices of whole wheat bread, or about half a cup each of cooked kidney beans and cooked cauliflower or squash--during early adulthood, breast cancer risk dropped by 13%. The greatest apparent benefit came from fruit and vegetable fiber.\n\nThe authors speculated that eating more fiber-rich foods may lessen breast cancer risk partly by helping to reduce high estrogen levels in the blood, which are strongly linked with breast cancer development.\n\n""From many other studies we know that breast tissue is particularly influenced by carcinogens and anticarcinogens during childhood and adolescence,"" said Walter Willett, Fredrick John Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition at Harvard Chan School and senior author of the study. ""We now have evidence that what we feed our children during this period of life is also an important factor in future cancer risk.""\n\n###\n\nOther Harvard Chan School researchers involved in the study included Heather Eliassen, associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology, and Xiaomei Liao, research scientist in the Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.\n\nThe study was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01 CA050385 and UM1 CA176726 and a grant from The Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Farvid was supported by the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.\n\n""Dietary Fiber Intake in Young Adults and Breast Cancer Risk,"" Maryam S. Farvid, A.

Those consuming the most fiber were about 20% less likely to develop breast cancer in middle age, according to the release. The data analyzed was drawn from a long-term epidemiological study of factors that affect women’s health (the Nurses’ Health Study II). The release doesn’t note that the findings show a relationship, but not a cause. This study doesn’t provide proof that fiber caused the reduction in cancer risk, and there’s still uncertainty as to if and how fiber might “fight cancer.” Like the CBS and NPR news stories also reviewed by HealthNewsReview.org, the release does not tell us if the lowered risk refers to absolute or relative risk. Maybe those omissions in subsequent news coverage started here, with the news release.

381,story_reviews_01368,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3237/,2010-10-12 13:37:24,Special Report: Life and death in the age of the bionic heart,"[""BOSTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - In September 2007, Verna Schrombeck gathered three of her six children — those who could bear it — to discuss her funeral arrangements. She had been given just months to live and was about to undergo a last-ditch, cutting-edge heart surgery. There was no guarantee she would return home.\n\nGeri Norris poses for a portrait holding the rechargeable batteries for her Heartmate II Left Ventricular Assist System at her home in Marlborough, Massachusetts September 21, 2010. The device, implanted inside the patient's chest and powered by external, rechargable batteries connected by a cable coming out of the patient's side, pumps blood through the circulatory system on a continuous basis, taking over most of the heart's work. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nHad she organized things well enough, she wondered, so that her eldest son, who was in charge of the estate, would not be burdened? Had she taught her handicapped son, an adult, enough life skills to take care of himself? She asked that the Ave Maria be played at her funeral.\n\nA week later, Verna’s sister drove her 8 hours from Lowell, Indiana to Rochester, Minnesota, to the Mayo Clinic, one of the country’s best hospitals for heart surgery. Her daughter flew in from Kansas. By the time Verna arrived at the hospital she could barely walk to the admissions desk. “I leaned over the railing, gasping for breath,” she said. “I told my daughter, “you have to get me a wheelchair.”\n\nVerna, now 78, was suffering from heart failure, a progressive condition that, in its advanced stages, makes walking even a few feet difficult. She had received multiple treatments, including drugs and an implantable heart defibrillator, but nothing was working. In a final Hail Mary, doctors decided to implant an experimental, battery-powered mechanical heart pump known as a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, into a cavity in her abdomen to assist her heart in pumping.\n\nBy the time she returned home, Verna, who received the device as part of a clinical trial, was able to dispense with her oxygen tank and take on household chores. Three years later, she is teaching piano to her five great-grandchildren, cooking meals for her family and driving by herself.\n\n“It has transformed me,” she said.\n\nThe device, called HeartMate II and made by Thoratec Corp, was approved by U.S. health regulators in 2008 to keep patients alive while they waited for a heart transplant. But in January, it was approved for permanent use in patients who are ineligible for a transplant, expanding the number of potential recipients from a few thousand to tens of thousands, and potentially changing the landscape for the treatment of end-stage heart failure.\n\n“There has been a ten-fold increase in the use of these devices since they were approved for permanent use,” said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and director, Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “We are going to know a lot more a year from now but my anticipation is that it will have been the approval of this device in January that will have really set the field in motion.”\n\nTo survive, patients must be connected to a lead called a drive-line that runs from the LVAD out through the skin and to a power source. At night the drive-line is plugged into a base unit with a display screen that provides statistical data, which in turn is plugged into a wall socket. By day patients are powered by a set of rechargeable batteries, weighing six or seven pounds, that can be carried around in a bag, holster or vest. The batteries are connected to a controller the size of a paperback book that can be worn on a belt around the waist.\n\n“We like to say I’m bionic,” said Geri Norris, 63, a native of Bristol, England who now lives with her husband in Marlborough, Massachusetts.\n\nShe is one of the new crop of patients who will live with the device indefinitely. One big drawback, she jokes, is not being able to wear the clothes she likes.\n\n“This is not exactly a fashion statement,” she said ruefully, plucking at the light-blue L.L. Bean fishing vest that carries her equipment.\n\nWhile powered by battery, patients can go about much of their daily lives. But being plugged into the wall at night, albeit with a cord long enough for a trip to the bathroom, takes some getting used to.\n\n“You know how they tether dogs to a clothes line?” said Norris, with a laugh. “That’s what it feels like.”\n\nAN UNNATURAL DEATH\n\nThe rise in use of mechanical heart devices represents a dramatic leap forward in the treatment of heart failure. But it also raises some potentially troubling ethical questions: these machines have the capacity to extend life beyond its natural cycle and beyond what might be desirable.\n\n“This is one of the ways our technology has moved ahead of our humanity,” said Stevenson. “We haven’t had enough experience yet about how to help people die naturally who have a ventricular assist device. And I can tell you, it is difficult to die with one of these things in place. The body does not give up easily when the blood flow is maintained.”\n\nNot that patients don’t die. Infections are a fairly common cause of death, as are bleeding and stroke. But death may not always come naturally. And decisions must be made about turning the device off.\n\n“We have to address what is the meaning of death on one of these pumps,” said Dr. Valluvan Jeevanandam, chief of cardiac and thoracic surgery at the University of Chicago Medical Center and an investigator for Thoratec’s clinical trials.\n\nRoughly 70 percent of patients on the HeartMate II were alive after a year, and nearly 60 percent were alive after two years, according to the latest data.\n\n“It’s not hard to imagine a person who has had severe stroke that has impacted both sides of the brain, the kidneys are shutting down, he is on a respirator, but yet the LVAD just keeps churning along,” said Martin Smith, a clinical ethicist at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nUnder U.S. law, patients are allowed to ask that implanted devices be turned off. But Dr. Diane Meier, a professor in the department of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said cardiologists are particularly bad at preparing patients for death, especially this kind of death.\n\n“The number of consults that the palliative team gets from cardiologists can be measured on one hand,” she said. “We are called upon much more frequently by physicians in other disciplines.”\n\nHOLY GRAIL\n\nStill, LVADs are improving the quality of life for hundreds of patients, including Dick Cheney, the former vice president of the United States and a multiple heart attack survivor. Moreover, the importance of LVAD technology goes beyond its impact on existing patients. It provides a platform for research into stem cell and other therapies designed to regenerate a patient’s own heart.\n\n“The Holy Grail is for a sick patient to get a pump, which immediately helps,” said Dr. Randall Starling, Head of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplant Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. “Then we inject his own stem cells — maybe in one shot or over the course of a year — then he improves and his heart recovers, and then he has the pump removed.”\n\nLVADs have made regenerative therapy research — the new science that uses stem cells to generate new organs and tissue — much easier, since the risk of hurting a patient is minimal. The LVAD carries out the heart’s main pumping function, no matter what research is conducted on the patient’s own heart. Once the patient undergoes a transplant, the treated native heart, with its cells and its genes, can be examined and studied.\n\n“In five years, we will have some fairly substantial number of patients treated and followed for a couple of years,” said Dr. Leslie W. Miller, director of the University of South Florida’s Cardiovascular Clinical and Research Integrated Strategic Program.\n\nThese advances may never materialize, or they could be years down the road. Even so, early data have proved promising and young patients who are scheduled to receive a transplant might consider postponing the procedure, which is irreversible, Miller said.\n\n“Maybe a mechanical pump is a better five to 10 year solution for these people because we hope to be in a better place by that time with stem cell technology and other regenerative models,” he said. “Transplant survival at one year is 85 to 88 percent, and 60 to 65 percent at five years, and I think we can have these kind of figures with these devices.”\n\nCRAZY ROBOTIC HEART\n\nDaniel Roth, who just turned 23, is one of the young people faced with such a decision. Since receiving his LVAD a year and a half ago, he has lived an active life. He works in a hospital, exercises and plays in a rock band — Teamwork. He is determined to get a transplant.\n\n“I could wait five years and hope stem cell therapy will work but by then I’m nearly 30 and I have things I want to do,” he said. “I want to be a musician, and go on tour. I would sacrifice some years off the end of my life — not too many — for the years left to be as awesome as they can be.”\n\nRoth says he has been told transplant patients can expect to live 20 to 25 years, but Dr. Mark Slaughter, professor and chief of the division of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the University of Louisville is not so sanguine.\n\n“The survival rate at one year is more than 80 percent,” he said, “but after that there is a 4 percent decline every year, so that in 20 years everyone is dead. You have a very finite timeline.”\n\nRoth, who lives with his parents in Norwood, Massachusetts, became ill in late 2006 with stomach pains and shortness of breath, while studying marine biology at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. In January, 2007, he had a stroke. He was diagnosed with an enlarged heart and placed on the list for a transplant.\n\nFor the next two years he returned repeatedly to the hospital with symptoms such as vomiting, fluid retention and shortness of breath. A defibrillator was implanted.\n\n“I became very depressed and docile,” said Roth, who these days brims with optimism and energy. “Playing in my band took every last ounce of strength.”\n\nHe struggled on, with medications, but in early 2009 he caught a stomach bug that he could not shake. He returned to the hospital. While there, his heart stopped.\n\n“He coded for about six minutes,” said his mother, Ellen, tearfully.\n\nEmergency workers revived him, but by that time he was too ill for transplant surgery.\n\nEven if he had been physically fitter, there is no guarantee a donor heart would have been available. It is estimated that some 50,000 people around the world are candidates for heart transplant, but only 5,000 patients per year get them.\n\n“The only option for me was this crazy robotic heart,” he said. It was implanted in April 2009.\n\n“That summer was amazing,” he said. “I traveled with my band, I did everything. I didn’t realize how sick I was until I got this thing.”\n\nNow he is eligible once again for a transplant. And he wants one. He wants to be free of the encumbrances of the LVAD, the endless changing of the batteries, the fear that the wiring might “crap out,” that a power outage might hit. He remembers vividly a fourth of July weekend away with friends in Maine. A fuse in the old house they were staying in blew and cut all power. “It was like a bad movie, where the clock starts ticking on your life,” he said.\n\nA flurry of calls to doctors and nearby hospitals led him to Maine Medical Center in Portland, which had an extra base unit. But he fears that if he is on tour in a remote part of the country, or overseas, he may not be so lucky.\n\nTo get his heart transplant, Roth needs to manage his weight — one of his biggest challenges — since one of the criteria for matching a donor heart with a recipient is weight class. A heart donated by a 150-pound woman won’t support a 280-pound man.\n\n“I’m doing well now, I’ve lost 25 pounds, and after the transplant I’ll be an angel,” he said ebulliently.\n\nEXPANDING MARKET\n\nIn addition to regenerative medicine coming down the pike, new generations of LVADs are also in development.\n\nThe HeartMate II is a third-generation device and a vast improvement over its predecessor, the HeartMate XVE, which was so large it could not be used in small women, and noisy enough to be disconcerting both to the patient and those around him.\n\nDan Mooney, who had a long history of heart attacks and had several bypass surgeries by the time he was 53, received a prior generation LVAD in early 2002 — shortly after 9/11 — and survived on it for about 14 months, according to his widow, Cathy. But people found him scary.\n\n“He would get into an elevator, with his fishing vest and all these wires coming out, and he was ticking,” she said. “In public he scared people half to death.”\n\nThe HeartMate II, by contrast, is quiet. It pumps blood on a continuous basis, which eliminates the pulse.\n\nCurrently, the HeartMate II dominates the market. But a rival company, HeartWare International Inc, of Framingham, Massachusetts, is developing a smaller device that some experts believe could, if approved as expected by early 2012, gain significant market share and possibly eclipse the HeartMate II.\n\n“I think the market overall is going to be very substantial, but I do think that ultimately HeartWare has a better product, so if that’s the case, why not try and bet on the best in class technology,” said Kris Jenner, a portfolio manager at T-Rowe Price Healthcare Sciences Fund. Jenner expects the market for ventricular assist devices to be worth as much as $1 billion in five years time.\n\nStill, HeartWare CEO Douglas Godshall is cautious about building expectations too high.\n\n“We have certain advantages over Thoratec — our device is smaller and can be placed in the chest rather than a pocket in the abdomen, which physicians like, and it’s a faster procedure,” he said. “But it is not an insignificant advantage to already have approval and be on the market and have had a chance to work out a lot of your kinks. We are just finding out what our kinks are.”\n\nLarry Feinberg, who runs Oracle Investment Management and holds shares in Thoratec, said he believes both companies will be winners over the long term.\n\n“I don’t think there will be one dominant player and the other falls by the wayside,” he said. “I see it more as being a pretty close horse race, with each technological advance causing each to leapfrog the other. There are very high expectations for HeartWare. If their data isn’t perfect the stock could get really slammed.”\n\nResults of HeartWare’s pivotal ADVANCE Bridge-to-Transplant Trial will be presented at this year’s annual American Heart Association meeting in November and both physicians and Wall Street analysts expect positive results.\n\nEstimates vary as to the ultimate number of people who could benefit from the device, with some predicting 30,000 and others more than 100,000.\n\nHow far the market expands will likely depend on whether the device is used to treat patients at an earlier stage of their disease, in the hope of staving off a worsening of symptoms. Stevenson, the Harvard professor, said there is a “spirited” debate occurring in the medical community about the merits of this.\n\n“Risks that seem very reasonable for somebody who has a miserable quality of life at home may be less reasonable if we have somebody who doesn’t feel all that bad at home,” said Stevenson. “We don’t really have much data at all beyond two years. And we’re already finding some surprises that are not such happy news.”\n\nIn particular, she said, physicians are finding that there is more bleeding and a different kind of bleeding — much of it in the colon, stomach and nose — than seen with Thoratec’s earlier device, the HeartMate XVE.\n\n“Right now we’re all waiting to see how much more that’s going to be,” she said.\n\nThoratec Chief Executive Gary Burbach said the company is studying the problem, which appears with the continuous flow pump technology and is thought to somehow cause a disruption in the complex blood clotting process. Thoratec will continue to develop its pumps based on the current technology, he said, and doctors can manage the bleeding with medication.\n\nBREAKING FREE FROM THE WIRE\n\nExperts agree that there will be an advantage to whichever company can dispense with the external drive-line so that the entire system, including batteries and controller, are beneath the skin and power is transmitted across the skin.\n\n“I’m a believer that the percutaneous drive-line ultimately needs to go away,” said Slaughter, the University of Louisville professor who is co-principal investigator on HeartWare’s bridge-to-transplant trial.\n\nTotally implantable LVAD technology — known as transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) — are not new. But before being clinically useful the technology and battery life need to be improved, said Slaughter.\n\n“If you wanted a TET system from which you could disconnect for 15 to 20 minutes a day, you could have one in six months,” he said.\n\nThat might give a patient the chance to jump in a shower but probably would not be worth the more complicated surgery. If a patient could be disconnected for two hours a day — enough to swim, relax in a hot tub, or be intimate with a partner — that could significantly increase their quality of life.\n\n“If you want to be disconnected for one hour twice a day, I think that could be doable within the next two years,” Slaughter said.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nThoratec has its sights set on developing a totally implantable device, with no drive-line and longer-running batteries within five years, Burbach said.\n\nIt is still unclear how long the devices will keep patients alive. Experts say they could last as long as 10 years.\n\nVerna Schrombeck, for one, has come to terms with the uncertainty. “There is a tranquility that one has,” she said. “You’ve fought your battles, and you’ve learned to accept life as it is now — lightning bugs, the fireflies, the deer that come up and stand on their hind legs as they grab the apples. We don’t know where this is going to lead. But that’s true of everyone’s life.” (Reporting by Toni Clarke and Debra Sherman; Editing by Jim Impoco and Claudia Parsons)""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was an interesting story of unusual length (3,155 words) that touched on important ethical issues.  But it was a flawed story – with no discussion of treatment costs, no numbers given for the frequency of harms, and no rigorous evaluation of company claims. </span>"," This is a story about some of the new medical devices either on the market or in development to help people with serious heart conditions live longer.  The story included several personal vignettes of individuals whose lives have been markedly improved with the technology.   The story did a good job providing an interesting description of technology, but it failed to included any quantitative information that readers could use for insight about the likelihood of benefit or of harm from the use of the devices.

Program, researchers in Madrid implemented a three-year healthy lifestyle intervention for 3 to 5 year olds that used their school, teachers and families to promote cardiovascular health through healthy diet, increased physical activity, understanding of the human body and managing emotions.\n\nOver 2,000 children in 24 Madrid public schools were followed during the program and exposed to the lifestyle intervention for three years, two years or one year depending on their age when the program began. Intervention materials included classrooms materials, take-home activities to do with their families and activities organized within the school\'s annual health fair. Students were assessed by pediatric psychologists at the start of the program and again annually for three years with a questionnaire to determine their knowledge, attitude and habits toward diet, physical activity and the human body.\n\n""There is a need for a complete change in the timing of when we deliver care,"" said Valentin Fuster, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the paper. ""Until now, the clinical community has focused on cardiovascular disease, which typically manifests in the later stages of life. Now, we need to focus our care in the opposite stage of life--we need start promoting health at the earliest years, as early as 3 to 5 years old, in order to prevent cardiovascular disease.""\n\nChildren in the intervention group scored 5.5 percent higher on their knowledge, attitude and habits score than students not receiving intervention after the first year, 7.7 percent higher after the second year and 4.9 percent higher after the third year. Overall scores were influenced by the level of parental education and income, with the highest impact seen in families with at least a high school education and higher income. There was no difference in score based on parental age, but a higher impact in score was seen for children whose parents were of European origin.\n\nBody weight, height, waist circumference, skinfold thickness and BMI were also measured. The prevalence of obesity among children at the end of three years was 1.1 percent in the group receiving intervention compared to 1.3 percent in the control group. The total of overweight children was 7 percent in the intervention group and 7.4 percent in the control group. The largest positive changes in body fat were seen in the 3-year-old group that received three years of interventions. Interventions less than two years were not successful at reducing body fat.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Deepak L. Bhatt, M.D., M.P.H., executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the program is groundbreaking, and follow-up studies to further pinpoint the exact mechanisms by which the program achieved positive effects on young children\'s health will be vital for implementing the program in other areas and informing the design of future global programs.\n\n""It may not only be the cardiovascular health information from the program that is helpful but also the cognitive stimulation from and exposure to positive adult role models, which in turn influence personality traits critical for health behavior and habits,"" Bhatt said. ""This pioneering study represents a very important step in exploring the intersection of child development, cardiovascular health promotion and primordial prevention. We eagerly await longitudinal follow-up, data from other age-groups, and outcomes related to families and schools from the SI! Program.""\n\nThe study and editorial are part of a comprehensive Population Health Promotion issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology focusing on issues that broadly impact public health and the prevention of cardiovascular disease and related conditions. Population health is a strategic priority of the American College of Cardiology, which recently brought together experts from around the world to address issues such as smoking and nutrition in the context of developing public health strategies for improving population health.\n\n###\n\nThe Journal of the American College of Cardiology, which publishes peer-reviewed research on all aspects of cardiovascular disease, is the most widely read cardiovascular journal worldwide. JACC is ranked No. 1 among cardiovascular journals worldwide for its scientific impact.\n\nThe American College of Cardiology is a 49,000-member medical society that is the professional home for the entire cardiovascular care team. The mission of the College is to transform cardiovascular care and to improve heart health. The ACC leads in the formation of health policy, standards and guidelines. The College operates national registries to measure and improve care, provides professional medical education, disseminates cardiovascular research and bestows credentials upon cardiovascular specialists who meet stringent qualifications.

The release goes too far in describing the impact of these changes.,"A study in Madrid of 2,000 preschoolers compared those who received special education in heart-healthy living with those who didn’t – and showed a modest improvement for children who received the lessons.

The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions.\n\nHemophilia B is caused by a defect in the gene for Factor IX. Fatal if untreated, the disease occurs almost only in men because the Factor IX gene lies on the X chromosome, of which men have only a single copy.\n\nWomen who carry a defective gene on one X chromosome can compensate with the good copy on their other X chromosome, but they bequeath the defective copy to half their children. About one in 30,000 of newborn boys have the disease, with about 3,000 patients in the United States.\n\nDr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The virus homes in on the cells of the liver, and the gene it carries then churns out correct copies of Factor IX. A single injection enabled the patients to produce small amounts of Factor IX, enough that four of the six could stop the usual treatment, injections of Factor IX concentrate prepared from donated blood. The other two patients continued to need concentrate, but less frequently.\n\nPhoto\n\nTreating a patient with concentrate costs $300,000 a year, with a possible lifetime cost of $20 million, but the single required injection of the new delivery virus costs just $30,000, Dr. Katherine P. Ponder of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis notes in her commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, calling the trial “a landmark study.”\n\nThe patients have continued to produce their own Factor IX for up to 22 months, said Dr. Edward G. D. Tuddenham, director of the Hemophilia Center at the Royal Free Hospital in London. One patient, a geologist, had a good response at first, but his level of Factor IX has declined to 1 percent of normal, the level at which the disease kicks in.\n\n“We attribute this to the fact that he had an inflammation, and although we treated it promptly, we should have been quicker off the mark,” Dr. Tuddenham said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If all goes well, a genetic treatment for hemophilia B “could be available for widespread use in a couple of years.”\n\nIn a trial in 2006, a patient injected with a corrective gene produced his own Factor IX but only for 10 weeks. The designer of that treatment, Dr. Katherine A. High of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.\n\n“I think it’s incredibly exciting, and I say that even though these people are my competitors,” she said. Dr. High is listed as a co-author of the report because her laboratory helped monitor the patients and provided proof for regulators that the virus would not insert its human gene into the patients’ sperm and make the change hereditary.\n\nA serious problem with other delivery viruses is that they insert themselves randomly into chromosomes, sometimes disrupting a gene. The virus used by Dr. Nathwani’s team, known as adeno-associated virus-8, generally stays outside the chromosomes, so it should not present this problem. Still, patients will need to be monitored for liver cancer, a small possibility that has been observed in mice.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a showstopper, but it’s a critical safety issue that has to be assessed,” Dr. High said.\n\nPatients have little or no immunity to the adeno-associated virus, which infects rhesus monkeys. The virus has a propensity for making liver cells its target, which is good for the therapy because these cells are the natural producers of Factor IX. However, liver cells do not live forever and slowly replenish themselves, possibly limiting how long the therapy will last.\n\nAbout 80 percent of hemophilia cases are of the type known as hemophilia A, which is caused by defects in a different blood-clotting agent, Factor VIII. Researchers have focused on hemophilia B, in part, because the Factor IX gene is much smaller and easier to work with.""]","Overall, this story provided a clear, contextual explanation of what was done in this research and what its impact may be.","We were struck by how well the story was organized, structured and written.  Very easy to follow.

That’s why doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will test deep brain stimulation (DBS)—a procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain to provide small electric pulses as a way to help people recover control of their movements.\n\nThe hospital recently received the green light from federal authorities to start the first ever human trial of DBS for stroke, and plans to announce Tuesday that it will perform the procedure as soon as an initial patient is identified.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nClose to 800,000 Americans have a stroke each year and estimates suggest about half of those people will be disabled from it. With physical therapy, many people regain some motor function, but the brain damage cannot be reversed and many still have profound movement problems.\n\n“Despite advances in physical therapy and acute treatment of stroke there are still too many people who live with long term disabilities, and new technologies are needed,” said Dr. Andre Machado, the chairman of the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute who is leading the trial and will perform the procedures.\n\nDBS has been used to treat tremors associated with Parkinson’s disease, but Machado said the new approach, if successful, will achieve something novel. “The big difference is that when we are treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, we’re trying to make the symptom, like a tremor, go away,” he said. “When we are treating stroke, we are really trying to make movement come back. There is something inherently different about that.”\n\nAnd inherently harder. DBS has never been used on humans as a way to regain a function. And experts aren’t even entirely sure why it works for Parkinson’s in the first place. But for 10 years, Machado and his team have been studying the effects of DBS on rats. They found that rats with strokes who received DBS had more proteins in the brain that are associated with brain plasticity—and twice as many synapses or connections between nerve cells compared to rats with strokes who did not undergo DBS.\n\nIf all goes as planned, Machado will insert the electrodes in the brain of someone severely disabled by stroke who has exhausted all other options without improvement. The electrodes will be placed on parts of the brain that communicate with the damaged region and surrounding areas. The electrodes will be attached to a wire that connects them to a battery pack located under the skin in the chest—the pack looks similar to a pacemaker. The stimulation will hopefully jump-start the brain’s recovery process and help them gain more control while undergoing standard therapy.\n\nGet The Brief.

About 87% of all strokes are this type.\n\nDBS is a type of brain surgery, and comes with risks like bleeding, infection and need for more surgeries. Since the procedure is experimental, there may be some unknown risks as well. Depending on how the first procedure goes, the hospital will enroll more people into its trial. If ultimately successful, DBS could become a treatment used in tandem with physical rehabilitation. “The goal of this therapy is not to replace physical training, but rather to boost the effects,” Machado said. “The proposition here is to make that recovery greater.”\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]","We question why a national news outlet would consider it newsworthy to report on an approach before human trials begin, and then call it an “exclusive” and “groundbreaking.”","This story explains that researchers at the Cleveland Clinic are searching for a first patient for a trial testing whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) might be helpful in improving the outcome of physical therapy in disabled stroke patients.
It provides little solid evidence that such a procedure would lead to a positive clinical outcome.  Nevertheless, the story suggests that this serious invasive brain surgery might work and the headline describes it as potentially “groundbreaking.” The story also overlooks that the costs per patient would seem prohibitive for the volume of people who might seek it out.
Later in the story, things get a little less breathless: We find out there are harms associated with this surgery, including some that might not yet be known.

Spencer Green/AP M. Spencer Green/AP\n\nTammy Wade knew she had to try something else to lose weight when she stepped on the scale and saw the number: 203 pounds.\n\nWade, 50, of McCalla, Ala., is only 5 feet 3 inches tall. She had tried everything. Nothing worked.\n\n""I had problems with my feet and ankles, and they were saying I was borderline diabetic,"" Wade says. ""I\'m like, well, I gotta do something, you know. So, I needed, really did need to lose the weight.""\n\nSo Wade volunteered to help test Qnexa, an experimental drug pending before the Food and Drug Administration. She quickly noticed a big difference.\n\n""I didn\'t feel ravenous, and I didn\'t want to snack all day long,"" she says.\n\nOver the next year, Qnexa helped Wade slowly drop about 40 pounds, and keep it off for another year. ""It makes you feel so much better,"" Wade says. ""Your back don\'t hurt, your feet don\'t hurt.""\n\nBut the FDA rejected Qnexa in 2010 because of concerns about side effects, especially possible heart problems and birth defects.\n\nFDA Briefing Documents Released Update Feb. 17, 10:30 a.m.: The FDA posted a 200-page review of the possible risks and benefits of Qnexa on the agency\'s website. The review noted continued concerns that Qnexa can increase the risk for several possible side effects, including increased heart rate, birth defects and thinking problems such as memory lapses and confusion. But the agency also noted Qnexa does appear to help many people lose at 5 percent of their body weight, In addition, it was ""somewhat reassuring"" that the drug also appears to produce some health benefits beyond weight loss, including lower blood pressure. Among the questions the agency plans to ask an advisory committee meeting Feb. 22 to review the drug, is whether Vivus Inc., which makes Qnexa, should conduct a study better assessing the drug\'s affect on the heart before the drug is approved. In its own 166-page review, Vivus called Qnexa a ""significant advancement in the medical treatment of obesity"" and detailed the potential benefits of the drug. The company also outlined a plan to minimize the chances that women of childbearing age would take it.\n\nQnexa\'s rejection came amid a flurry of failed attempts by drug companies to win approvals of new weight-loss drugs. The setbacks put a spotlight on how the FDA handles these drugs.\n\nEven though obesity is at epidemic levels, the FDA hasn\'t approved any new weight-loss medicines since 1999.\n\n""We have two-thirds of all Americans who are overweight or obese, and the costs are nearing $150 billion a year,"" says Christine Ferguson, a health policy professor at George Washington University. ""The sheer magnitude of the problem really requires us to address it more aggressively and thoughtfully than we have.""\n\nFerguson has been helping to organize a series of meetings involving public health experts, anti-obesity advocates, government officials and others to try to figure out what the FDA should do.\n\n""We actually have this huge gap,"" says Joe Nadglowski of the Obesity Action Coalition, who has been participating in the meetings. ""We go from Weight Watchers to bariatric surgery. And the fact that there isn\'t ... medical treatments for obesity, including pharmaceuticals, really is a challenge, considering how big the problem is in this country.""\n\nPart of what\'s going on is that the FDA has gotten a lot more cautious about approving new drugs in general after some serious drug-safety problems, such as heart problems linked to the painkiller Vioxx.\n\nThe FDA has been especially tough on weight-loss drugs because of previous problems with those drugs, such as the diet drug cocktail fen-phen.\n\n""There\'s been a long history with obesity drugs that we\'ve had to take off the market. You recall the fen-phen episode where a significant number of people got heart-valve defects,"" says Janet Woodcock, a top FDA official.\n\nWoodcock argues that the agency has to be extra-careful with weight-loss drugs, because chances are it won\'t just be obese people taking them.\n\n""When you\'re talking about a drug where it could go into literally tens of millions of Americans, there has to be attention to safety,"" Woodcock says.\n\nWhat might look like a rare problem now could turn into another public health disaster, she says.\n\nBut some say the agency\'s aversion to accepting any risks is outdated. They say the FDA wrongly still tends to view weight-loss drugs as diet pills — something frivolous and used primarily for cosmetic purposes.\n\n""We are not talking about medications to help someone lose five pounds to fit into their prom dress or wedding dress. We\'re talking about medications to help those who are struggling with the health impact of obesity,"" Nadglowski says.\n\nSo Nadglowski and others are pushing the FDA to take into consideration whether the risks of new drugs may be outweighed by their benefits beyond weight loss, such as reducing the risk for heart disease, diabetes and other complications of obesity.\n\nWoodcock says officials realize they may have to think about things differently.\n\nAs the FDA works through this, many are watching how the agency handles Qnexa. An FDA advisory panel is scheduled to review Qnexa again on Feb. 22.\n\nBarbara Troupin of Vivus, the company that is developing Qnexa, says the drug appears to do a lot more than just help people lose weight.\n\n""We see decreases in blood pressure. We see decreased rates of progression to diabetes. We see improvements in sleep apnea. We see improvements in quality of life. Pretty much all of our data shows significant benefits,"" she says.\n\nVivus hopes the FDA will agree that those benefits will outweigh some of the risks, including the concerns about birth defects. The company is submitting new data it says show that the risk is lower than had been feared. Vivus also has a plan to minimize the chances that pregnant women will take it.\n\nSome see Qnexa as a test of the FDA trying to recalibrate how it weighs risks and benefits for weight-loss drugs.\n\nFor her part, Wade just wants to be able to start taking it again. She\'s gained back half of the weight she lost.\n\n""I need to lose 20 more pounds again,"" she says. ""And I need the help.""']","On the eve of an FDA meeting about the Qnexa drug, this NPR blog post did a reasonable job capturing the tradeoffs and the review/approval dilemma for the FDA.","We like how the blog post linked to the FDA briefing documents, allowing interested readers to do more homework if they wished. That’s a little addition – that can be a big help for readers – and for the completeness of the overall reporting effort.
However, the story could have directly included – even at a high level – some of the data from the clinical trials so that readers could have an appreciation for the magnitude of the weight loss seen. The one line – “Qnexa does appear to help many people lose at 5 percent of their body weight” – wasn’t sufficient in our view.

Enzyme capsules taken before a meal can relieve discomfort by helping the body to break down problem foods, say companies that sell the pills. Doctors say some enzyme supplements work well, but others need more human studies.\n\nDigestive enzymes are proteins that work like scissors to break down foods. The pancreas, where many of these enzymes are made, can slow down as we age, which can result in bloating and other gastrointestinal discomfort, says Steven Lamm, clinical assistant professor at New York University School of Medicine and a paid consultant to Enzymedica Inc., a Venice, Fla., company that sells enzyme capsules. Gastroenterologists say it is true the pancreas can slow down with age, but gastrointestinal upsets can be from many causes.\n\nPrescription enzymes are often given to patients who have ""pancreatic insufficiency,"" in which the pancreas doesn\'t make enough enzymes to digest food, doctors say. But many people with milder gastrointestinal problems—such as gas and bloating—are turning to enzymatic dietary supplements for relief. Sales of over-the-counter digestive enzymes in the U.S. hit $136 million in the past 12 months, up 4% from two years ago, according to Spins LLC, a Schaumburg, Ill., market-research firm.\n\nThe concept of an over-the-counter enzyme blend seems ""reasonable"" but ""there are not high-quality, well-designed studies"" that prove they work in humans, says Lin Chang, director of the digestive health and nutrition clinic at the University of California in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso, says David Whitcomb, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, many over-the-counter enzymes are made in fungi—resulting in proteins that digest food efficiently but haven\'t been tested for humans.\n\nThe first over-the-counter enzymes to hit the U.S. market had narrow applications. Lactase, an enzyme that digests a sugar in milk and is lacking in lactose-intolerant people, went on sale in pill form in the 1980s. In 1991, alpha-galactosidase, which aids in digesting beans, cabbage and broccoli, appeared under the brand name Beano, now sold by Medtech Products Inc., Tarrytown, N.Y. Lactase works well, doctors say, and at least four small, published human trials have found the main ingredient in Beano can reduce gas after a meal of beans.\n\nMany newer products aimed at a broader spectrum of foods and digestive concerns are now on the market, but they haven\'t been tested in human trials. Enzymedica\'s Digest Gold is a blend of enzymes, including proteases for digesting protein; amylase, for starches and lipase, for fat. Mega-Zyme, sold by a North American unit of Germany\'s Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. in Green Bay, Wis., contains a powerful enzyme blend the company\'s website says can ""help relieve occasional gas and bloating.""\n\nNeither company has done clinical trials on its enzyme products, though Enzymedica says it is planning human trials. Both companies say lab tests show their enzymes do what they are expected to do. For example, says Jeremy Appleton, a naturopathic doctor at Schwabe, proteases are tested to make sure they efficiently break down proteins. He says Schwabe doesn\'t know of any side effects but adds people with fungal allergies should use the products with caution.\n\nA number of products, such Enzymedica\'s Gluten Ease 2x, which hit the market last year, are aimed at people who get sick from eating gluten. Humans haven\'t evolved with the ability to fully digest gluten, says Alessio Fasano, director of the Center for Celiac Research at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In most people, gluten doesn\'t cause problems, but in people with celiac disease, it causes an autoimmune reaction, Dr. Fasano says. People with ""gluten sensitivity"" can have symptoms such as stomach aches, joint pain, fatigue and headaches, he adds.\n\nEnzymedica\'s website notes the product isn\'t for celiac patients, who need to avoid even trace amounts of gluten. Dr. Fasano agrees, but says patients with gluten sensitivity could try the enzymes. But since the enzymes can work slowly, he says he is skeptical the capsules will work fast enough for many patients, who experience symptoms in minutes or hours.\n\nEnzymedica founder Tom Bohager says lab tests show the product works quickly—with an average of 60% large gluten molecules broken down in a half-hour and 75% at 90 minutes. The company says customers have reported only occasional side effects—such as stomach cramping. In the case of cramps, the company recommends reducing the dose.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com']","This story had excellent sourcing, but journalistic legwork isn’t enough to ensure a quality piece.","The major problem is that it’s not clear which of the story’s sources we should trust: the independent experts pointing out the lack of human studies, or the company spokesmen touting their products’ effectiveness in the lab. Both are given about equal time, and there’s no clear indication that one view should trump the other.

The study involved people who had a first episode that was suggestive of MS, such as numbness, vision problems or problems with balance, and an MRI that showed signs of possible MS. Up to 85 percent of people in this situation, which is called clinically isolated syndrome, will in time be diagnosed with MS. “Not much research has been done on how starting treatment this early affects the long-term course of the disease,” said study author Ludwig Kappos, MD, of University Hospital Basel in Basel, Switzerland, and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. “Our study adds to the evidence supporting treatment at the earliest sign of the disease and indicates that early treatment has a long-lasting effect on disease activity.” The study started with 468 people randomly assigned to receive either early treatment with interferon beta-1b or a placebo. After participants were diagnosed with MS or after two years, the participants on the placebo could switch to interferon beta-1b or another drug. After 11 years, researchers reevaluated the 278 people who were still participating in the study, which included 167 people in the early group and 111 people in the delayed group. Those who received the early treatment were 33 percent less likely to be diagnosed with MS than those who received the delayed treatment. People in the early group also had more time before their first relapse of the disease than people in the delayed group, with 1,888 days compared to 931 days. The early group also had a lower overall yearly relapse rate of 0.21 compared to 0.26 for the delayed group, which is 19 percent lower. There was no difference between the two groups in the tests that measure overall disability or in MRI scans measuring the amount of damage caused by the disease. “Overall, early treatment appears to have a benefit on relapses, especially early in the disease, but limited effects on other outcome measures, including outcomes reported by patients,” said Brian C. Healy, PhD, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a member of the American Academy of Neurology, who wrote an accompanying editorial. Limitations of the study include that participants and researchers learned after the fifth-year tests which participants received the drug and which received the placebo and that after the placebo-control phase of the study, all of the participants received treatment, so there was no untreated control group after that point.

All of the patients had experienced a first episode suggestive of MS, called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), and a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan suggesting MS. Up to 85 percent of people with CIS go on to develop MS.
The two patient groups were randomized to either receive interferon beta-1 by injection immediately or receive a placebo for two years. After two years, the placebo group could receive their treatment of choice.
The patients who received the drug immediately appeared to have fewer relapses over the 11 years of study, according to the lead author, but no advantages were observed in other patient outcomes such as overall disability and MRI scans. The release would have been stronger if it provided more context for judging the reduced number of relapses, especially in light of the two groups showing no difference in disability. The release also omitted mention of significant potential conflicts of interest, the high annual cost of interferon beta-1 and the drug’s side effects.

421,story_reviews_00513,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/will-drinking-coffee-extend-life/,2015-11-16 05:00:00,Will drinking coffee extend your life? ,"['Gut Check is a periodic look at health claims made by studies and by newsmakers. We ask: Should you believe this?\n\nThe Claim: If you drink coffee you’ll live forever! Well, almost: nurses and other health professionals who drink coffee (regular or decaf) had a lower risk of premature death than coffee abstainers.\n\nThe Backstory: . . . is enough to make STAT cross-eyed. Decades of studies have examined links between coffee drinking and health outcomes. Overall, the conclusions have been pro-coffee. Lots of research has linked coffee drinking to a lower risk of dying early, including this, this, and this. Other studies have found associations with lower risk of specific conditions, like this on cardiovascular disease (by many of the same authors as the new study), this on stroke, this on heart failure, and this on diabetes. Most research has found the greatest benefits with daily consumption of around three or four cups — usually 6 to 8 ounces, and without distinguishing regular from decaf. Fewer studies link coffee to a higher likelihood of dying prematurely, but this classic found a link between 6-plus cups a day and dying of cardiovascular disease, while this 2013 paper, on 43,727 people followed for a median of 17 years, concluded that adults under 55 who averaged more than 4 cups a week had a 56 percent (men) or 130 percent (women) higher risk of dying over the study period than non-coffee drinkers.\n\nFirst Take: The new research, published in Circulation on Monday and funded by the National Institutes of Health, mined three large, ongoing epidemiological studies (74,890 women in the Nurses’ Health Study, 93,054 women in the Nurses’ Health Study 2, and 40,557 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), following them for at least 20 years. Overall, the heaviest coffee-drinkers (more than five cups a day, regular or decaf) had a tiny 2 percent additional risk of dying compared with coffee abstainers. Those drinking 1.1 to 3 cups, and 3.1 to 5 cups, had slightly (9 percent and 7 percent) lower risks of dying.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThen the researchers, led by Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, did something clever: they ran the analysis on nonsmokers only. That eliminated the stereotypical coffee-swilling, cigarette-sucking types. Result: people drinking 1.1 to 3 cups a day had an 8 percent lower mortality risk, while the 3.1-5-cup crowd had a 15 percent lower mortality risk, mostly due to lower risk of deaths from cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, type 2 diabetes, and suicide. Even the 5-plus’s had 12 percent lower mortality.\n\nA co-author of the 2013 study linking heavy coffee drinking to higher mortality called the new one “very good,” especially since it controlled for the deadly effects of smoking, which the earlier one did not. It “supports the safety and efficacy of even high doses of coffee in non-smokers,” said Dr. Carl Lavie, a cardiologist at Ochsner Health System. But given the 2013 research suggesting “toxicity of high coffee doses” in some people, he said, “to me the most reasonable approach would be to keep coffee intake to two to three cups most days.”\n\nSecond Take: STAT knows better than to get between coffee lovers and their cup o’ joe, so if you want to take this study as permission to keep beating a path to your Keurig, we’re not going to slow you down.\n\nBut…\n\nThis is another observational study, where researchers look for associations between people’s freely-chosen diet and other lifestyle decisions and subsequent health outcomes. Correlations do not establish causation: a link between Behavior A and Health Outcome B might or might not mean that A caused B. It might mean instead that a third factor — another behavior, socioeconomic status, even personality or genetics — might go hand in hand with Behavior A and be the true cause of Outcome B. Maybe people who drink coffee have some genetic, psychological, or behavioral trait (drinking fewer sugary beverages? eating less junk food?) that causes the observed benefit.\n\nBut surely the population in this study is so huge and socioeconomically similar (all health professionals) that correlation is more likely to reflect causation?\n\nMore likely, yes, but don’t count on it. This same Nurses Health Study, for instance, infamously found a correlation between post-menopausal hormone therapy and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, here and here. That turned out to be wrong. The definitive, randomized Women’s Health Initiative study showed that hormone therapy raised the risk of cardiovascular disease, contradicting the NHS and shocking nearly everyone.\n\nTakeaway: Observational studies that associate coffee drinking with health benefits are strongly suggestive but not definitive. If you do want to infer causation from this latest study, know that drinking coffee reduced the absolute mortality risk from 6.8 deaths a year per 1,000 people to, at best, 5.8. That is, each year, coffee would be keeping 1 person in 1,000 from dying.']","This story on the latest coffee study delivers an appropriate evidence-based message, and manages to do so while keeping readers engaged and entertained.","This STAT story does an exemplary job of describing, and putting into context, yet another observational study of the possible links between coffee consumption and health, this one concluding that overall, whether decaf or regular, coffee is associated with reduced risk of death from heart disease, diabetes, and neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, although not cancer. The great strengths of the story include links to notable previous studies that explain the confusing “backstory” of the coffee consumption/health risk debate among researchers and consumers, along with one of the best definitions of the limitations of observational studies this reviewer has read in a news article. The STAT story gets the quantification and qualification issues down, but also goes the extra mile in noting a strong example of how observational studies can fail consumers and professionals (post-menopausal hormone safety), and in entertainingly giving readers a useful take-home message — drink up, but  but understand that while the health benefits are “strongly suggestive,” they are “not definitive.” Extra credits goes to STAT for noting the absolute mortality risk reduction this way: “coffee would [keep] 1 person in 1000 from dying” each year — something a competing CNN story on the same study lacked.

Spencer Green/AP\n\nYogurts and supplements loaded with ""friendly"" bacteria may be able to fight the nefarious ones and soothe fickle bowels, according to a new study.\n\nA Cochrane Library review of 63 studies found that probiotics can shorten the time a person has acute diarrhea -- with no negative side effects. On average, using probiotics reduced a bout of diarrhea by more than a day, and reduced the risk of a prolonged diarrhea episode -- four days or more -- by 59 percent.\n\nStephen Allen, a pediatrician at Swansea University in the United Kingdom who lead the review, tells Shots that probiotics were effective in almost all the studies, which had more than 8,000 participants total, his team evaluated. Among the different bacteria tested were L. acidophilus, S. boulardii, and L. casei, which occur naturally or are added to products like supplements, yogurt, miso, soy milk and some juices.\n\n""Surprising thing was it didn\'t really matter what type of probiotic was used or in which setting,"" Allen says. However, the impact of the probiotics varied greatly from study to study, researcher found.\n\nAuthors of the review note that probiotics can work in several ways, including robbing the offending bacteria, viruses or parasites of nutrients.\n\nThe review confirms the findings of another review in 2004, which also showed that probiotics had some effect against diarrhea. Allen says that since the original review, there\'s been increasing interest in probiotics and, therefore, more research.\n\n""The conclusions we can draw [now] are much stronger,"" Allen says.\n\nScientists are also optimistic about using probiotics in developing countries where diarrhea is a big problem and can even be fatal. Even so, Allen says more research is needed to determine the specific strains of bacteria that are most effective. And, he says, researchers need to take a look at probiotic regimes that could best target different cases of acute diarrhea in both developed and developing countries.']",The study on which the story was based was really only about acute diarrhea – not about “soothing the stomach” or “fickle bowels” – vague descriptions that many people may feel they have.  So in that sense the story was a bit misleading.,"There’s been a lot of news coverage and a lot of marketing claims about the alleged benefits from products containing probiotics. The study reported on is from the well respected Cochrane organization.   A Cochrane review is comprehensive and rigorous, meaning that the conclusions are important and can change medical practice.
But this story included only the perspective of the lead author of the study with no independent perspective. And, in including a claim about possibly soothing stomachs (in the headline) and soothing “fickle bowels” (in the lead), it stepped outside the boundaries of evidence.

Franks Jr., MD, of the NYU Langone Medical Center, says thalidomide is very effective for treating people with lupus skin conditions who do not respond to standard treatments such as steroids and antimalarial drugs.\n\nHe says about 75% of patients with affected skin will go into remission with these standard treatments.\n\n“The question has been, ‘What do you do with the rest?’” he says.\n\nFranks says thalidomide can help an additional 75% of patients achieve remission. But side effects are common and some, including nerve damage in the hands and feet, can be permanent.\n\nLenalidomide Highly Effective in Small Study\n\nThe lenalidomide study included 15 women with lupus skin conditions; six had lupus in other areas of the body, too. They all were followed for seven to 30 months.\n\nAll had received standard treatments, and 14 had been treated with thalidomide previously.\n\nThe majority of the patients (60%) had the most common subtype of lupus-related skin disease, known as discoid lupus erythematosus, which is characterized by red, scaly patches that can scar.\n\nOne patient withdrew from the study after one week due to digestive system side effects. All the other patients showed improvement, and the rash cleared up in 86%.\n\nThe researchers note that the study dose was “generally well-tolerated.” No new nerve symptoms were reported.\n\nSimilar to treatment with thalidomide, most of the patients had a relapse of their skin problems within weeks of stopping the drug.\n\nNo Progression to Full Disease\n\nSeveral earlier small studies raised concerns that treatment with lenalidomide may be linked to an increased risk of progression to full-blown lupus, not just lupus limited to the skin.\n\nJosep Ordi-Ros, who led the Spanish study, says this was not seen in the latest study, which was published Dec. 6 in the journal Arthritis Research & Therapy.\n\nBut Cynthia Aranow, MD, of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y., says larger studies will be needed to determine if the drug is truly safe and effective for patients who do not respond to other treatments.\n\nShe adds that the drug appears to have a similar risk for birth defects as thalidomide, so it will need to be monitored just as carefully.\n\n“There are many questions that remain,” she says.\n\nLenalidomide is available as Revlimid to treat people with multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. According to the manufacturer’s site, the cost of Revlimid at the doses used in this study would be about $440 a pill.']",This story about research on an experimental approach for lupus skin conditions raises more questions than answers regarding effectiveness.,"A drug related to thalidomide (which is commonly used to treat lupus skin conditions), showed positive effects in a very small trial. But it may be too soon to start touting the benefits of the treatment without a more comprehensive clinical trial.  The story seemed more interested in highlighting thalidomide’s past than in explaining the very limited evidence for a new drug – the use of which may also be very limited.

It really is big news,” said Dr. Bernard Zinman, director of the Diabetes Centre at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who led the three-year study of 7,000 people.\n\nBecause about one-half of the deaths in people with type 2 diabetes are caused by cardiovascular disease, reducing cardiovascular risk is considered essential to diabetes care. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and is linked to obesity.\n\nJardiance, a once-a-day pill which won U.S. approval last year, belongs to a new family of treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors that include Johnson & Johnson’s Invokana and AstraZeneca Plc’s Farxiga. They lower blood sugar by inhibiting reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys.\n\nJardiance was developed jointly with Germany’s privately held Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\nZinman, in an interview, predicted the new study would prompt medical societies to recommend that Jardiance be used by type 2 diabetics who have a history of heart disease or who are at risk of cardiovascular events.\n\nAbout 26 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, according to federal data for 2014. The vast majority of those patients could be candidates for Jardiance, which costs over $4,000 per year, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.\n\n“The big news here is that the drug reduced cardiovascular stuff. That has not been the case with all things in diabetes,” said David Marrero, president of health care and education at the American Diabetes Association. “It is probably going to be a more popular drug because of that.”\n\nJARDIANCE COULD BOOST EARNINGS\n\nSanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson more than tripled his annual sales forecast for Jardiance and combination drugs containing it to $2.7 billion by 2020. He cut his 2020 sales forecast for Merck & Co Inc’s Januvia, the leading member of a competing class of oral diabetes drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors, to $6 billion from $7.8 billion.\n\nAnderson estimates Jardiance could boost Lilly’s earnings per share by 8 percent on average across 2016 to 2020.\n\nIn the study, patients taking Jardiance had a 38 percent reduction in cardiovascular death, including from heart attacks and strokes. There was no significant difference in non-fatal heart attacks or non-fatal strokes.\n\nThose taking Jardiance had a 32 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 35 percent lower rate of hospitalizations from heart failure.\n\nThe benefits were especially impressive because they added to protection that patients received from taking cholesterol fighters and other life-saving heart drugs, Zinman said.\n\n“This is a wonderful thing,” said Dr. Jerome Tolbert of Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York. He has not prescribed Jardiance and similar drugs as frequently as treatments like Januvia, but expects that may change based on the new data.\n\nZinman noted that Jardiance, like other SGLT2 drugs, causes weight loss and reduced blood pressure, besides lowering both blood sugar levels and body fat, and also reduces swelling, which all help the cardiovascular system.\n\nLilly and Boehringer last month disclosed that Jardiance met its primary study goal, becoming the first diabetes drug to show heart-protective results in a large cardiovascular trial. But they did not unveil detailed data until Thursday at the medical meeting.\n\nShares of Lily closed up 6.5 percent at $89.98 on Thursday, after rising as high as $92.83.\n\nIn calculating the combined number of cardiac deaths, non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal strokes, 14 percent fewer events were seen in patients taking Jardiance in combination with standard treatments, compared with patients who took standard treatments alone, meeting the study’s main goal.\n\nStandard treatments included statins, which lower cholesterol, and blood pressure drugs.']","Our reviewers had concerns about this story’s reliance on relative risk estimates. The more informative absolute numbers were easy enough to find in the abstract of the study being reported on, but they didn’t make it into the story.","This Reuters story summarizes new findings about Jardiance (empaglifozin), a diabetes drug developed by Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim and approved by the FDA last year. Following a recently published study, Jardiance is now being positioned as an add-on to standard care and a preventative therapy that reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, as well as risk of death from any cause, in patients with type 2 diabetes. The story capably lays out the basics of the study, but its reliance on relative risk figures (which may tend to inflate the magnitude of the effect), as well as the lack of any comment on potential harms, were considered significant drawbacks by our reviewers.
Editor’s note: We learned that Reuters made updates to the initial version of this story, including the headline, after our review was complete.

Sales last year were $1.7 billion.\n\nAn independent Nordic study, published at ESMO on Sunday, revealed 566 patients who were given Erbitux plus a three-drug chemotherapy regimen called FLOX, in first-line treatment for bowel cancer, did not live longer or gain any significant extra benefit to those on chemotherapy alone.\n\nBREAST CANCER BREAKTHROUGH\n\nIt is the first time researchers have shown that a drug like Erbitux, which targets a protein called epidermal growth factor involved in cancer cell growth, can provide substantial benefit in difficult-to-treat “triple negative” breast cancer.\n\nWomen with triple negative breast cancer have tumors that do not respond to two types of hormonal therapy, or drugs that target a protein called HER-2.\n\nThe disease tends to spread through the body rapidly and there are few treatment options, though Sanofi-Aventis has a promising drug in late-stage development.\n\nThe Phase II study included 173 women whose cancer had spread and who had received other treatments. The best overall tumor response rate, of 20 percent, was in those given Erbitux. This compared with 10 percent among those on cisplatin alone.\n\nErbitux, known generically as cetuximab, also more than doubled the median time before the patients’ disease worsened, to 3.7 months from 1.5 months.\n\nBaselga said that level of improvement was rarely seen in this advanced-disease population and was highly promising.\n\n“This study clearly opens the field ... I am convinced that cetuximab or other anti-EGFR agents have a role in triple negative breast cancer. No question,” he said.\n\nMISSED TARGET\n\nStill, further studies will be needed to build the case, including testing Erbitux alongside other types of chemotherapy, he added, noting the Phase II study did not meet its primary objective of proving a greater than 20 percent response rate.\n\nDr. Fabrice Andre from Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, France, who was not involved in the research, said the results were “extremely important” but echoed the view that the findings now had to be confirmed in larger-scale clinical tests.\n\nIn practice, experts suspect triple negative breast cancer represents a number of different disease sub-groups and that analyzing patients according to the molecular profile of their tumors may help identify a sub-group that could benefit most.\n\nWolfgang Wein, head of oncology at German drugmaker Merck, welcomed the latest findings, which could broaden the market for the company’s key medicine.\n\nMerck suffered a setback last year when its attempts to win marketing approval to sell Erbitux in lung cancer were rebuffed by regulators.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story could have been much more clear on the real take-home point: <span style=""font-family: Arial;"">Women in this trial only lived an additional two months without the disease getting worse but </span>without a discussion of potential harms associated with Erbitux, it is difficult to determine if the benefits of living an additional two months without the disease getting worse would outweigh the potential side effects.  </span>","Results from a Phase II clinical trial presented at a medical meeting suggest that the drug Erbitux may be useful for treating a type of breast cancer that does not respond to hormone therapy or other targeted treatments. The fact that these data were presented at a medical meeting suggests that the results have not been published in a journal and therefore, have not undergone a rigourous review process. Additionally, a Phase II trial only enrolls a small number of participants to evaluate the efficacy and safey of a treatment before initiating a more robust Phase III trial. Unfortunately, the story did not report any of the safety data.

Paresthesia-based therapy provides pain relief with a light tingling sensation while sub-perception therapy works without that sensation. With the Spectra WaveWriter System, patients can choose to combine both of these therapies to target one specific area of pain or use each therapy as needed to best manage multiple areas of pain. Patients provide real-time feedback using the system\'s remote control. Together, these features benefit patients by addressing each individual\'s unique pain relief needs.\n\n""Patients suffering with chronic pain experience pain differently, and pain also evolves over time, sometimes causing a patient to become less responsive as the body becomes accustomed to treatment,"" said Dr. Giancarlo Barolat, neurosurgeon, Barolat Neuroscience, Denver, Colorado. ""Until now, the medical community has had limited options to offer personalized pain relief therapy to patients. The main advantage of the Spectra WaveWriter System is that it integrates multiple therapies into a single device so that treatment can more easily be tailored to individual needs.""\n\nThe Spectra WaveWriter System was developed with more than a decade of clinical research focused on optimizing sub-perception and delivering multiple therapies intended for more effective, long-term pain relief.

Millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain. The primary non-opioid strategy for treating that problem are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), like aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen and celecoxib. 
The alternative described here — electrical nerve stimulation —  uses a small generator to send electrical pulses to relevant nerves in an effort to interfere with the nerve impulses that create feelings of pain. The device, Spectra WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulator, has just received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and this news release portrays it as the beginning of a new day. But the release lacks specifics, and readers have no way of judging whether this optimistic framing is justified. We worry that the release misses on a number of our evaluation criteria, including information about cost and details of both risks and benefits stemming from the small studies conducted to date.

HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS A new study out this week suggests a dietary supplement from a Chinese plant may create changes on the ends of our chromosomes that help keep DNA intact, possibly boosting the immune system. The research, published in the scientific journal Rejuvenation Research, reports on a year-long study on a dietary supplement called Telomerase Activator TA-65, which researchers believe may help reverse the aging process by lengthening telomeres — the caps on the ends of chromosomes that keep DNA intact as cells divide. Shortened telomeres are linked with aging and a lowered immune response. But some aging and telomere experts are skeptical. The study raises more questions than answers, says Janko Nikolich-{Zcaron}ugich, chairman of the Department of Immunobiology and co-director of the Arizona Center on Aging at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. ""This study may be the basis for a fully controlled clinical trial,"" he says. But he says the study shouldn\'t be used to promote the supplement because it was not designed to test the body\'s immune response to it. But the study\'s authors believe the results are a positive reflection on the supplement\'s potential as an anti-aging compound. ""The key message in this study is that in individuals taking the novel telomerase activator supplement, after a one-year period, there was a reduction in production of cells with short telomeres,"" says study author Calvin Harley, CEO of Telome Health Inc., in Menlo Park, Calif., who says the study is funded by the product\'s maker, TA Sciences. The ongoing observational study included 114 people who took 5 to 10 mg a day of the supplement, derived from a dried Chinese root, Harley says. Some upped their dose to 25 or 50 mg a day over time without signs of adverse effects, Harley says. At the beginning of the study and at three-month intervals through the year, blood samples were drawn and dozens of tests were conducted on telomerase activation. ""Those data showed TA-65 activates telomerase roughly 2- to 3-fold,"" Harley says. He says the percentage of immune cells with short telomeres declined about 10% to 50% in most of the individuals tested, and there was a decrease in the number of aged immune cells of roughly 10% to 20%. ""The basic principle they put forward is if you activate telomerase — an enzyme — you\'ll have more telomeres and have longer function by protecting chromosomes. They show their activating compound had some effect on telomerase activity, but it wasn\'t great,"" says John Pascal, assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Thomas Jefferson University. But Pascal says telomere maintenance and research is certainly a valid area of scientific study. ""It\'s definitely a very pertinent topic because it seems to play a role in regulating how long the cell can continue to replicate and function normally,"" Pascal says. Frederick Vagnini, medical director of Heart, Diabetes and Weight Loss Centers of New York, says he has had as many as 20 patients on the supplement, including himself. ""I look at it as a cellular protectant and boosting immunity,"" says Vagnini, who says a drawback is that it can carry up to an $8,000 annual price tag, depending on daily dose. But others, including Alzheimer\'s disease expert Nilufer Ertekin-Taner, an assistant professor of neurology and neuroscience at the Mayo Clinic, suggest caution with studies of this type and note that the study should be considered preliminary. ""It could get peoples\' hopes up and yet we have so little to work off of,"" Ertekin-Taner says. Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Siliq is administered as an injection.\n\nSiliq is intended for patients who are candidates for systemic therapy (treatment using substances that travel through the bloodstream, after being taken by mouth or injected) or phototherapy (ultraviolet light treatment) and have failed to respond, or have stopped responding to other systemic therapies.\n\n""Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis can cause significant skin irritation and discomfort for patients, and today’s approval provides patients with another treatment option for their psoriasis,"" said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""Patients and their health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of Siliq before considering treatment.""\n\nPsoriasis is a skin condition that causes patches of skin redness and flaking. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that occurs more commonly in patients with a family history of the disease, and most often begins in people between the ages of 15 and 35. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, in which patients develop thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white scales.\n\nSiliq’s active ingredient (brodalumab) binds to a protein that causes inflammation, inhibiting the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of plaque psoriasis.\n\nSiliq’s safety and efficacy were established in three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 4,373 adult participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. More patients treated with Siliq compared to placebo had skin that was clear or almost clear, as assessed by scoring of the extent, nature and severity of psoriatic changes of the skin.\n\nSuicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicides, have occurred in patients treated with Siliq during clinical trials. Siliq users with a history of suicidality or depression had an increased incidence of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to users without this history. A causal association between treatment with Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established.\n\nBecause of the observed risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, the labeling for Siliq includes a Boxed Warning and the drug is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Siliq REMS Program. Notable requirements of the Siliq REMS Program include the following:\n\nPrescribers must be certified with the program and counsel patients about this risk. Patients with new or worsening symptoms of depression or suicidality should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate.\n\nPatients must sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement Form and be made aware of the need to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening suicidal thoughts or behavior, feelings of depression, anxiety or other mood changes.\n\nPharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Siliq.\n\nSiliq is also approved with a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, and that because Siliq is a medication that affects the immune system, patients may have a greater risk of getting an infection, or an allergic or autoimmune condition. Patients with Crohn’s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq. Health care providers should not administer Siliq to patients with active TB infection, and should avoid immunizations with live vaccines in patients being treated with Siliq.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions reported with the use of Siliq include joint pain (arthralgia), headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), nausea, muscle pain (myalgia), injection site reactions, influenza, low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fungal (tinea) infections.\n\nSiliq is marketed by Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The Agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###\n\nInquiries Media: Andrea Fischer 301-796-0393 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA\n\nRelated Information']","News release on a new injectable biologic drug for psoriasis comes with strong cautions about side effects, but incomplete description of the evidence.","
The US Food and Drug Administration just approved a new drug to treat psoriasis, a common skin condition that can form thick, silvery scales and itchy, dry, red patches. Siliq (brodalumab) is mainly intended for patients who don’t respond to other forms of treatment, like anti-inflammatory topical medications and light therapies. The “last resort” recommendation may be due to the four completed suicides that took place during the clinical trial, leading the FDA to believe that Siliq may be correlated to an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior — especially in patients with a history of depression. As a result, the FDA is requiring Siliq to be sold with a “boxed warning” (the strictest warning put in the labeling of prescription drugs) and only through a restricted program.
The FDA news release devotes a significant chunk to the drug’s potential harms and makes clear who should or shouldn’t be taking Siliq. What’s mainly missing from the release are any numbers to give a sense of the scope of potential benefits and harms.  Regarding the drug’s potential benefits, the release uses only vague, comparative wording (“more patients… had skin that was clear or almost clear.”).  We don’t know how the participants were selected, how long they were followed up and how their improvement was assessed.
Furthermore, a clinical trial was stopped for a period of time due to safety concerns, which was then continued by another drug manufacturer. Although not explicitly stated, it is fair to assume that drug manufacturers also funded these clinical trials. These are study limitations that were never disclosed by the news release.
We did find a 90-page FDA briefing document online from 2016, which includes some efficacy data. Curiously, this document mentions five clinical trials instead of three. We’re not sure why the FDA release didn’t include the two other clinical trials that compared Siliq (brodalumab) to ustekinumab.
We also reviewed TIME.com’s coverage of this new drug.

The results may help family members who are trying to get pregnant make decisions as well.']","This brief story overlooks costs and harms to the procedure, and doesn’t discuss the evidence supporting preimplantation genetic screening.","
The story is a brief overview of preimplantation genetic screening, in which couples who are using in vitro fertilization (IVF) to become pregnant have embryos tested for genetic disorders before proceeding with implantation.
The story does not address cost or risks in any way. But what is most puzzling is why this story was written now. There does not appear to be a news hook, and preimplantation genetic screening has been around for decades. It’s also not made clear enough that this information applies to couples undergoing IVF only.

Corticosteroids have traditionally been the only FDA-approved treatment for these diseases, although some doctors had prescribed adalimumab off-label.\n\nThe FDA’s approval is limited to treatment of the three types of noninfectious uveitis that pose the greatest threat of vision loss. Glenn Jaffe, M.D., a professor in the Department of Ophthalmology at Duke University School of Medicine, said adalimumab works to treat uveitis by targeting a protein that is thought to promote inflammation. Jaffe led one of two clinical studies that formed the basis of the FDA’s approval and was senior author of the study appearing Sept. 8 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\n“Patients may have many unwanted side effects when taking steroids long-term, as many uveitis patients do,” Jaffe said. “The goal of these studies was to determine whether there was an alternative that could replace or minimize the use of steroids. The studies also looked at whether an alternative would be better tolerated or more effective, yet still safe.”\n\nThe study consisted of 217 adults who had active, non-infectious intermediate or posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. Participants were randomly assigned to a group that received either adalimumab or a placebo at the start of the trial and every two weeks thereafter. All participants also initially received standard doses of the corticosteroid prednisone, and continued to receive it in diminishing doses over the course of 15 weeks.\n\nJaffe and colleagues then analyzed patients’ time to treatment failure, or how soon they saw a recurrence or worsening of one or more of four signs of inflammation: new areas of inflammation in the back of the eye, reduced visual clarity, more inflammatory cells in the front of the eye, or more cloudiness of the gel that fills the eye. Jaffe said the study focused on time to treatment failure because delaying or preventing inflammation is the key to successful treatment.\n\n“It is the active inflammation, caused by the body’s immune system reacting against itself, that can potentially permanently decrease the patient’s vision and cause unwanted symptoms, such as eye pain and floaters in the field of vision,” he said. “The hope is that by delaying or eliminating recurrences, the symptoms will be minimized or eliminated.”\n\nThe researchers found that median time to treatment failure was 24 weeks in the adalimumab group and 13 weeks in the placebo group. Patients in the adalimumab group were also significantly less likely to experience treatment failure during the duration of the study (80 weeks) and they were at lower risk of treatment failure due to each of the four signs.\n\nJaffe said the study’s results are significant not only because they indicate adalimumab delays treatment failure, but also because the investigation considered several signs as causes for treatment failure.\n\n“Using these multiple, possible endpoints was something unique to this study,” Jaffe said. “Since each of these signs can be associated with different types of uveitis, the study’s results broaden the applicability of treatment for patients.”\n\nThe study authors note, however, that patients in the adalimumab group reported serious adverse effects, such as respiratory tract infections and allergic reactions, more frequently than those in the placebo group.\n\nIn addition to Jaffe, co-authors include Andrew D. Dick, Antoine P. Brézin, Quan Dong Nguyen, Jennifer E. Thorne, Philippe Kestelyn, Talin Barisani-Asenbauer, Pablo Franco, Arnd Heiligenhaus, David Scales, David S. Chu, Anne Camez, Nisha V. Kwatra, Alexandra P. Song, Martina Kron, Samir Tari, and Eric B. Suhler.\n\nAbbVie, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures and markets adalimumab as Humira, sponsored the study. Dr. Jaffe served as a consultant for AbbVie, and other study authors also report financial relationships with the company. Further author disclosures are available in the study’s manuscript.']","This news release earns praise for a very forthright disclosure, and solid reporting on the benefits and evidence, but it could have done more to inform readers about associated harms and the price tag for this expensive biologic drug.","A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy “biologic” drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in “severe adverse events” and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented.
The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company.
The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well.

The story needed more caution–there are plenty of unknowns here. For example, even if a person knows their score, there’s no proof that having that number will improve health outcomes.

There has been a good amount of research into AA and the 12 steps over the years, broadly finding that about a third of people maintain recovery from alcohol addiction due to 12-step treatment, another third get something out of the treatment but not enough for full recovery, and another third get nothing at all.\n\nResearchers have long suspected, though, that the benefits found in 12-step treatment programs are not exclusive to the 12 steps. As Zemore told me, “The benefits of 12-step groups are not driven by the 12 steps’ specific philosophy or adherence to the 12 steps. It’s really more about general mechanisms like abstinence motivation and social support for abstinence. Presumably, you could get those by participating in alternatives to AA.”\n\nIn other words, these alternatives could help the one-third to two-thirds of people who don’t get anything or much out of AA. That would help deal with a big public health issue: Based on federal data, more than 20 million people in the US have a substance use disorder, and within that group, more than 15 million have an alcohol use disorder. Excessive drinking alone is linked to 88,000 deaths each year. So finding the right solutions for this problem is literally a matter of life or death.\n\nWhat the study found\n\nThe study, conducted by the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute in California and published last month in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, surveyed more than 600 people with alcohol use disorder (AUD), who were divided by which mutual help group they primarily participated in. Researchers followed up at six months then 12 months, measuring involvement in the groups and various substance use outcomes, including abstinence from drinking and alcohol-related problems.\n\nAfter controlling for several factors, the researchers concluded that “[Women for Sobriety], LifeRing, and SMART are as effective as 12-step groups for those with AUDs.”\n\n“Essentially, that’s the story,” Zemore said. “We were really interested in whether the effects of involvement on recovery outcomes depended on which group [participants] were in. And we found that they did not.”\n\nThere were some differences in the data. People who reported SMART as their primary group seemed to have worse substance use outcomes, and there were lower odds of total abstinence among LifeRing members.\n\nThat might have something to do with differences in recovery goals. For example, AA really emphasizes total abstinence from drinking as the solution to alcohol addiction. Groups like SMART and LifeRing, meanwhile, can be friendlier to the idea of members moderating their drinking but not quitting altogether. That could affect substance use outcomes — and especially abstinence outcomes.\n\nThe study’s survey data suggests this is in fact what was going on: When researchers controlled for people’s recovery goals — meaning, whether they wanted to commit to lifetime total abstinence or not — the differences between the 12-step groups, SMART, and LifeRing went away.\n\n“That suggests that people with less commitment to lifetime total abstinence are more likely to participate in SMART and LifeRing than they are to participate in 12-step groups,” Zemore said. “That’s why you’re seeing these associations between SMART and LifeRing affiliation at baseline and worse recovery outcomes when you control for involvement.” She added, “But I want to emphasize that these go away when you control for recovery goals.”\n\nAgain, the study is not the final word. John Kelly, an addiction researcher at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study, told me that the study is “good news, in general,” but pointed out that it’s limited by its methodology: It’s based on an online survey, not the kind of randomized trial that’s typically the gold standard in research. That may have led to some potentially biased results — perhaps participants in specific groups were less likely to report bad outcomes, for instance.\n\nAnd since it’s only one study, it’s possible that the results were biased in some other way. So it’s up to future research to verify the findings.\n\nOne tricky thing with this line of research is you can’t really force people to participate in certain groups — so studies that randomly assign participants to AA, SMART, LifeRing, or Women for Sobriety may not be easy to do. But there are ways that researchers could get around these problems, such as only using participants who are willing to try different groups and actively following up with them to make sure they are actually participating.\n\nAnother big research question: figuring out why, exactly, these groups might work to help people stay alcohol- or drug-free. There’s good research into how AA works, but it’d be good to figure out if SMART, LifeRing, and Women for Sobriety work in a similar way. That, Zemore said, will be one of her goals in future studies.\n\nWhy we need alternatives\n\nIn discussions about addiction treatment, AA and the 12 steps tend to prompt polarizing reactions — some people swear by the programs, others absolutely hate them.\n\nThere’s a good explanation for that: While the research shows that 12-step treatment can be as effective as professional treatment modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy, the research also shows that the 12 steps don’t work for everyone.\n\nAs one example, a prominent complaint about 12-step programs is the spiritual aspect. This is a big part of the 12 steps, with the final step even invoking “a spiritual awakening.” For people who aren’t religious or spiritual, this can be a big turn-off; that’s one reason SMART and LifeRing exist to begin with — they’re meant to be secular alternatives to the 12 steps.\n\nThe good news is that the research suggests the spiritual aspect doesn’t fully explain why the 12 steps are effective for some people. Instead, it seems other traits are just as, if not more, important — such as the social support that AA meetings provide and the lessons that participants can pick up at meetings.\n\nThat’s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. If so, that would let some people go to AA meetings if they prefer the 12 steps, while others could find SMART, LifeRing, Women for Sobriety, or something else that works for them. Basically, everyone could find a workable solution.\n\nProviding these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. As Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University, previously told me, “We don’t have anything that works for everybody. There’s very few places in medicine where you do.” So there need to be as many alternatives as possible.\n\nThe US is far from that at the moment. Most treatment facilities in America are, according to the survey data and research, at least partly based on the 12 steps — making it the only option for many people. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they’re not nearly as available as AA — and they certainly aren’t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.\n\nAs Albert, a pseudonym for an AA member in Georgia, previously told me, “There’s just not a lot of widely advertised options available.” AA and 12-step treatment are “the most well-known and most recommended option, so that’s kind of where you tend to go.”\n\nZemore’s study begins to peel away at this problem. By showing that there really might be other effective options out there, the research provides hope that there may be a better — or at least more complete — solution out there for alcohol addiction.\n\nFor more on the research into AA and the 12 steps, read Vox’s explainer.']","But do these programs have any downsides and what do they cost? Readers would have benefited from hearing those specifics, but the omissions are relatively minor considering the broad scope of the coverage.","This is excellent coverage of a study suggesting that Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and similar 12-step programs aren’t the only worthwhile support groups for those recovering from alcohol use disorders. Alternative programs that (unlike AA) aren’t based on a spiritual philosophy may be just as effective, the results show.
The story earns high marks for thoroughly describing the evidence that forms the basis for the coverage and explaining its key limitations. It also features perspective from an independent expert and notes the big gap in availability between AA and its less established counterparts.
But do these programs have any downsides and what do they cost? Readers would have benefited from hearing those specifics, but the omissions are relatively minor considering the broad scope of the coverage.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends bone-density testing every two years. But that\'s just a guess. No one really knows how often screenings should occur.\n\n\n\nResearch presented Sunday suggested that women 67 and older with normal bone-mineral-density scores may not need to be screened for another 10 years -- a finding that could release thousands of women from the costs and inconvenience of repeated bone-mineral scans over the course of several decades.\n\n\n\nDr. Margaret L. Gourlay of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, looked at data from 5,035 women age 67 and older who were part of the long-running osteoporosis study called the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. Women 65 and older who did not have osteoporosis at the time were enrolled in the study from 1986 to 1988 and had bone-mineral-density testing at least twice during the study. The researchers calculated the estimated times for women to develop osteoporosis based on their T scores, the measure of bone density. They found that low-risk women -- those who had normal T scores -- did not develop osteoporosis for a very long time.\n\n\n\n""If a woman\'s bone density at age 67 is very good, then she doesn\'t need to be re-screened in two or three years because we\'re not likely to see much change,"" Gourlay said in a news release. ""Our study found it would take about 16 years for 10 percent of women in the highest bone density ranges to develop osteoporosis.""\n\n\n\nOverall, the study found that screening should be conducted every year for older postmenopausal women with T scores greater than or equal to -2 (osteoporosis is diagnosed when the T score is -2.5 or lower). Screening can take place at five-year intervals for older postmenopausal women whose T scores are above a -2 and every 10 years for women with normal bone density (above -1).\n\n\n\nThe study was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bone Mineral Research in Toronto.\n\n\n\n-- Shari Roan / Los Angeles Times\n\n\n\nReturn to Booster Shots blog.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">It’s hard to get beyond the insulting, inaccurate comment in the story’s lead that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on bone-density testing is ""just a guess."" </span>","Blog posts tend to be breezy, but they should still be rooted in the facts. This post took too much liberty with the findings from a recent study on bone density screening and left readers with the impression that regular screenings don’t offer much benefit. There is a case to be made for this impression, but the story does not make it. Compounding the problem is a significant factual error at the top of the story. The U.S. Preventive Screening Task Force does not recommend screening every two years. It recommends ""routine screening"" without specifying the interval for testing: a wise choice in the absence of much data. The task force simply cautions that testing more frequently than every two years is not supported by data: ""No studies have evaluated the optimal intervals for repeated screening. Because of limitations in the precision of testing, a minimum of 2 years may be needed to reliably measure a change in bone mineral density; however, longer intervals may be adequate for repeated screening to identify new cases of osteoporosis.""

A hot bath may help improve inflammation, metabolism, study suggests","['Rockville, Md. (November 15, 2018)--Hot water treatment may help improve inflammation and blood sugar (glucose) levels in people who are unable to exercise, according to a new study. The findings are published ahead of print in the Journal of Applied Physiology.\n\nPhysical stress such as exercise can cause the short-term elevation of inflammatory markers. After exercise, the level of an inflammatory chemical (IL-6) rises. In a process called the inflammatory response, this activates the release of anti-inflammatory substances to combat unhealthily high levels of inflammation, known as chronic low-grade inflammation. Recent research has shown that raising body temperature augments the inflammatory response and provides a rationale for identifying exercise alternatives that reduce low-grade inflammation in the body. Previous studies have also found a connection between a spike in body temperature and nitric oxide production, a substance that aids blood flow and helps carry glucose throughout the body.\n\nResearchers studied markers of inflammation and blood sugar and insulin levels in a group of sedentary, overweight men. The volunteers participated in both hot-water immersion and ambient room temperature (control) trials separated by at least three days. The researchers took blood samples before and after the participants rested in an 80-degree F room for 15 minutes. After the rest period, the participants either remained seated in the room or entered a hot-water bath for 60 minutes. In the hot water trial, the volunteers sat immersed up to their necks in 102-degree F water. The research team measured the men\'s heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature every 15 minutes throughout both the control and immersion conditions. Blood samples were taken again two hours after each session.\n\nThe researchers found that a single hot-water immersion session causes the elevation of Il-6 levels in the blood and increased nitric oxide production, but did not change the expression of heat shock protein 72--another protein suggested to be important for health. However, a two-week treatment period in which the men participated in daily hot-water baths showed a reduction of fasting blood sugar and insulin levels as well as improved low-grade inflammation at rest.\n\nThe men reported a level of discomfort during the hot water immersion trial, which could be due to the high temperature of the water or the length of time they were required to remain immersed. The researchers acknowledge that these conditions may make it difficult for people to commit to this type of alternative treatment. However, the positive results of decreased inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity suggest that hot-water immersion may ""improve aspects of the inflammatory profile and enhance glucose metabolism in sedentary, overweight males and might have implications for improving metabolic health in populations unable to meet the current physical activity recommendations,"" the researchers wrote.\n\n###\n\nRead the full article, ""The acute and chronic effects of hot water immersion on inflammation and metabolism in sedentary, overweight adults,"" published ahead of print in the Journal of Applied Physiology.\n\nNOTE TO JOURNALISTS: To schedule an interview with a member of the research team, please contact the communications@the-aps.org"">APS Communications Office or 301-634-7314.

The subheading is a fairly good summary of the study.
But the “Can’t exercise? …” headline promises much more than this small study can support.

Half of all patients are children. Epilepsy can result from brain injury, but in most cases the cause is unknown and may be genetic. Refractory epilepsy, its intractable form, and the medications with which doctors attempt to treat it can cause lifelong problems with learning, memory and behavior.\n\nAn epileptic seizure occurs when large groups of neurons in the brain begin firing uncontrollably, disrupting the balance of electrical activity and causing changes in mental function, motor function and behavior. It’s not known what sets off a seizure, but lately scientists like Dr. Devinsky have been gathering evidence that inflammation, the immune system’s response to injuries or foreign organisms, plays a pivotal role.\n\nScientists have known since the 1950s that inflammation is involved in a particularly vicious brain disorder called Rasmussen’s encephalitis, which starts seizures and usually affects children. Inflammation inflicts such severe damage to the brain that the standard treatment for the condition is hemispherectomy — the surgical removal of one of the brain’s hemispheres. Some researchers also suspect an inflammatory link to another form of epilepsy, infantile spasms, because children with the disease respond to ACTH, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland with strong anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nEleonora Aronica, a neuropathologist at the University of Amsterdam, has found signs of inflammation in autopsy specimens and surgical resections from patients with a wide range of epilepsies. Annamaria Vezzani, a neuroscientist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, has induced epilepsy in mice and rats by injecting kainic acid into their brains, and has observed the activation of a cellular pathway linked to inflammation before and during seizures.\n\nThe amount of inflammation in the brain correlates with the frequency of seizures, she also has found. “This is a novel finding,” Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. “It was not known that inflammation was a common feature of different types of epilepsy.”\n\nPhoto\n\nNormal brain function is regulated by the glial cells, which protect neurons and induce an inflammatory response if the brain is injured. But this response also can contribute to seizures, some experts believe, either because components of the immune system stimulate neurons or because the glial cells’ capacity to regulate the brain is diminished when they become “distracted” by an injury. As Dr. Devinsky noted, seizures in turn may produce further inflammation, perpetuating the cycle.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow Dr. Vezzani and colleagues are testing a molecule called VX-765 that disrupts the inflammatory process she discovered. In one study, high doses of the drug reduced the number of seizures by about two-thirds in mice with treatment-resistant epilepsy.\n\nSixty patients enrolled in a subsequent trial did not experience a statistically significant improvement after taking VX-765 for six weeks, but they did begin to experience fewer seizures at the end of the trial.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Comprehensive Epilepsy Center who is leading the new trial.\n\nReplacing anticonvulsants is not merely an end in itself. Although they give many epileptics a better quality of life, they do not affect the course of the disease, only its symptoms. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy’s underlying causes. “Giving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,” Dr. French said.\n\nBut there are dangers to this approach. Steroids — potent anti-inflammatories that some doctors are using for experimental treatments — can have harmful long-term side effects. And it remains unclear whether inflammation might be implicated in all forms of epilepsy or which patients might benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.\n\n“Like any new field, there’s a lot of enthusiasm and almost a bit of religion involved,” said Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, an epilepsy expert at the University of California, Irvine. “The challenge for the next few years is to find out the limitations, the boundaries, the real mechanisms.”\n\nStill, whatever the role of inflammation in epilepsy, Elisa Moller says that anti-inflammatories were a miracle intervention for her son. At William’s worst point, a night in July 2010, he had a seizure every time he fell asleep, suffering 23 grand mals between midnight and 6 a.m.\n\nDr. Devinsky had prescribed weekly doses of prednisone, a steroid, and in desperation Ms. Moller decided to administer a mega dose.\n\n“I was taking his life into my hands, I know,” she said. “But the way I looked at it, he was going to die anyway.”\n\nSince that night William has not had another seizure. He continues with the steroids and also follows the ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate regimen that has proved beneficial for many with intractable epilepsy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSteroids are “the one thing I refuse to take him off of,” Ms. Moller said. “The past year has been the best time of his life.”""]",The story is dominated by the profile of a mom believing that her epileptic son benefits from a “miracle intervention” of steroids.,"There are a lot of scientific questions mentioned in this story, but the bulk of the “proof” offered rests on the small shoulders of one 10-year-old child with epilepsy: one patient showing improvement over one year with drug treatments that have yet to prove their efficacy in large, randomized trials but are known to have significant side effects when used long term.

While it may reduce the risk of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern because of the potential for delayed diagnoses of important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment, according to investigators reporting in The Journal of Urology®.\n\nProstate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the U.S., with nearly 30,000 deaths annually. Deaths from prostate cancer have declined by about 40% since the advent of PSA screening in the late 1980s, and 40-70% of that decline may be attributable to screening. However, radiation therapy and surgery have a negative impact on quality of life. The uncertain benefit of PSA based screening, combined with the complications associated with treatment, led the USPSTF to conclude in October 2011 that the harms of PSA based screening outweighed the benefits, leading it to recommend against regular screening.\n\n""Our study was designed to assess the impact of the USPSTF recommendation on screening practices among urologists and primary care providers and the incidence of prostate cancer,"" explained lead investigator Daniel A. Barocas, MD, MPH, of the Department of Urologic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee. ""We know there is decreased utilization of PSA testing in some institutions and health systems, but has the number of incident cases per month changed substantially since the draft guideline was issued?""\n\nInvestigators evaluated the effect of the USPSTF guideline on the number and distribution of new prostate cancer diagnoses in the U.S. They identified incident cancers diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2012 in the National Cancer Database and assessed the trend of new prostate cancers diagnosed each month before and after the draft guideline was issued, comparing their findings with colon cancer.\n\nThis study helped quantify the potential benefits (reduced harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment of low risk disease and disease found in elderly men) and potential harms (missed opportunities to diagnose important cancers in men who may benefit from treatment).\n\nThe number of prostate cancer diagnoses dropped by more than 12% (1363 cases) in the month after the USPSTF draft guideline was issued and the number continued to drop, resulting in an overall decline of 28% in incident prostate cancer diagnoses in the year after the draft guideline was issued. By contrast, the number of monthly colon cancer diagnoses remained stable. Diagnoses of low, intermediate, and high risk prostate cancers all decreased significantly, but new diagnoses of non-localized disease did not change. The decreases were similar across all subgroups of age, comorbidity, race, income, and insurance.\n\nThe study showed that 12 months after the draft guidelines were published diagnoses of new low risk cancers had fallen by 37.9%, and continued to fall more rapidly than other disease risk strata, suggesting that, in this regard, the USPSTF recommendation had its intended effect,. Similarly, new diagnoses had fallen by 23.0-29.3% among men over age 70 and by 26.0% among infirm men, populations at risk for harms of treatment but unlikely to live long enough to benefit from early detection.\n\nHowever, the study also identified a drop of 28.1% in diagnoses of intermediate risk disease and 23.1% in high risk prostate cancer one year after the draft guideline, which could result in missing important opportunities to spare men with higher risk cancers from progressive disease and cancer death.\n\n""While some of the effects of this guideline may be beneficial in terms of reducing harms of over diagnosis and overtreatment, the reduction in intermediate and high risk cancer diagnoses raises concern for delayed diagnoses of important cancers associated with inferior cancer outcomes,"" noted Dr. Barocas. ""Future research should focus on prostate cancer screening paradigms that both minimize harms and maximize the potential benefits of screening, as well as accounting for individual patient risk factors and preferences.""\n\n###']",This news release seems imbalanced to us — it downplays the benefits and emphasizes the potential harms of guidelines that advocate less frequent screening.,"This news release reports on an attempt to measure the impact of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on PSA testing. A main point of emphasis in the release is the fact that diagnoses of intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer were reduced after the draft guideline was changed due to the USPSTF “thumbs down” on the PSA test. While the release contends based on that finding that the USPSTF guidelines may lead to “missing important opportunities to spare men with higher risk cancers from progressive disease and cancer death,” the larger question of whether more or fewer men will get advanced prostate cancer and die from it isn’t addressed by the study — and the release should have been clearer about that fact, rather than headlining the release, “More men at risk of prostate cancer…” Perhaps just as important — but given less air time in the release — is the fact that there are fewer cases of low-risk cancers being diagnosed. This finding suggests that the USPSTF guideline seems to be effective in reducing overdiagnosis.

It depends on whether you have dense breast tissue, experts say","['For women older than 50 who have been confused by conflicting advice on how frequently to get a mammogram, some new science is here to guide their decisions.\n\nAn ambitious research effort published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine set out to tailor women’s breast cancer screening practices to match their actual risk of breast cancer. It concludes that a woman’s breast density should influence the frequency with which she is screened for breast cancer, in addition to such long-recognized breast cancer risk factors as age, ethnicity, personal history of abnormal breast findings and a family history of breast cancer.\n\nFor a small slice of those women, that makes a once-a-year mammogram — twice as often as the current standard — the best bet.\n\nUnderwritten by the National Cancer Institute, the new study combined the data-collection efforts of breast-cancer epidemiologists with three separate teams of cancer modelers. In the study, women were separated into subcategories based on four levels each of individual risk and breast density.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe research recommends that women older than 50 with dense breast tissue who have higher-than-normal risk of developing breast cancer should get annual mammograms. These women, however, represent a small minority of women in that age group — less than 1% of all women between 50 and 74.\n\nMany women, however, could go as long as three years between mammograms without increasing their risk of death from breast cancer, the study found. For women with average risk and low breast density, the models showed that there was no difference in deaths averted from breast cancer whether they were screened every two years or every three years. Women who had a mammogram every three years, however, had fewer unnecessary follow-up procedures, including biopsies.\n\nAccepted clinical guidelines recommend that women 50 to 74 get a mammogram every two years. These recommendations, first proposed in 2009 by a federal task force, urged women to discuss with their physicians whether more frequent screening might be in order. But they have continued to be controversial with some activist and medical groups that believe additional lives could be saved if more women got an annual mammogram.\n\nThe latest study largely validates the controversial recommendations made by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009. But it also clarifies which women should or could depart safely from its recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly in the last decade or so have radiologists, oncologists and women’s health specialists begun to appreciate the role of breast density in a woman’s breast cancer risk. While radiologists have long warned that dense breast tissue made cancerous masses harder to spot, mounting evidence has found that cancer is also more likely to gain a foothold in dense breast tissue.\n\nThe latest effort is the first to produce a risk calculator that takes that into account, and asks for a radiologist’s standardized assessment of breast density in its six-point questionnaire. Many states now require radiologists reading mammograms to assign and communicate to a woman and her physician this density measure, called a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, or BI-RADS, score.\n\nOverall, the risk measure calculates a woman’s likelihood of developing breast cancer over five and 10 years, and compares it to normal risk.\n\nIn devising their models, the researchers updated assumptions that have cast doubt on the relevance of existing breast-cancer risk calculators, which relied on the experiences of women who got an earlier generation of screening mammograms and were more likely to die of breast cancer than is currently the case. Here, teams of modelers from Erasmus University in the Netherlands, Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare assumed that women were getting digital mammograms, which offer improved cancer detection rates at lower radiation dosages than earlier mammographic methods. They took into account improved rates of breast cancer treatment effectiveness, and changing causes of mortality for women older than 50. They also took account of the fact that breast density decreases in older women.\n\n“These models are very applicable to the populations we screen,” said UC San Francisco breast-cancer specialist Dr. Karla Kerlikowske, one of the lead authors of the new study.\n\nThe practice of tailoring screening intervals to a woman’s breast cancer risk is already widespread in some European countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands and Spain. A Spanish study, similar to the latest modeling effort, found that implementing a general three-year screening interval, with yearly screening for high-risk women, reduced overdiagnosis and caught more missed cancers.\n\n“Some lesions detected in screening will never grow to become clinically significant and will not impact a woman’s life,” Kerlikowske said.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow me on Twitter @LATMelissaHealy and “like” Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.\n\nMORE IN SCIENCE\n\nScientists unlock a secret to Latinos’ longevity, with hopes of slowing aging for everyone\n\nHow to track poverty from space\n\nScientists design a drug that relieves pain like an opioid without some dangerous side effects']",Outside commentary would have made this story much stronger.,"This news story reports on a study, described in the Annals of Internal Medicine, that was designed to clarify the role of breast tissue density in calculating the risk of breast cancer mortality, and thus help physicians and women over 50 make better informed choices about how frequently to have mammograms.
The story overall does a fair job of summarizing the main points about the study’s conclusions, and about the ongoing confusion, contradictions, and controversy surrounding best practices for “breast screening intervals.” It could have been clearer at the outset that the key conclusions related to triennial screening should apply solely to women over 50 at average or low risk of breast cancer. It could also have done a better job of bringing in outside commentary and interpretation from those not directly involved in the study, noting the weaknesses of “modeling” systems in general, and offering more detail about the potential physical and psychological harms unnecessary biopsies and treatments.
Most worrisome, though, was that the news story used direct passages from the news release, without attribution. This, paired with the lack of outside commentary, is not what we consider rigorous journalism.

535,story_reviews_01513,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/2983/,2010-07-05 05:16:46,“Mind-body” therapy shows promise for fibromyalgia,"['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A form of ‘mind-body’ therapy that focuses on the role of emotions in physical pain may offer some relief to people with fibromyalgia, a small clinical trial suggests.\n\nThe study, of 45 women with fibromyalgia, found that those who learned a technique called “affective self-awareness” were more likely to show a significant reduction in their pain over six months.\n\nOverall, 46 percent of the women had a 30-percent or greater reduction in their pain severity, as measured by a standard pain-rating scale. In contrast, of study participants who were assigned to a wait-list for therapy, none showed a similar decline in pain.\n\nFibromyalgia is a syndrome marked by widespread pain — including discomfort at specific “tender points” in the body — along with symptoms such as fatigue, irritable bowel and sleep problems. It is estimated to affect up to 5 million U.S. adults, most commonly middle-aged women.\n\nThe precise cause of fibromyalgia is unknown — there are no physical signs, such as inflammation and tissue damage in the painful area — but some researchers believe the disorder involves problems in how the brain processes pain signals.\n\nStandard treatments include painkillers, antidepressants, cognitive- behavioral therapy and exercise therapy. However, many people with fibromyalgia find that their symptoms — pain, in particular — persist despite treatment.\n\nPart of that, according to the researchers on the new study, may be because standard treatments do not specifically address the role psychological stress and emotions can play in triggering people’s pain.\n\nThat is not to say that the pain people with fibromyalgia feel is “all in their head,” stressed Dr. Howard Schubiner, of St. John Health/ Providence Hospital and Medical Centers in Southfield, Michigan.\n\n“The pain is very real,” Schubiner said in an interview. But, he explained, pain and emotions are “connected in the brain,” and emotional factors may act to trigger “learned nerve pathways” that give rise to pain.\n\nPast studies have found that compared with people without fibromyalgia, those with the disorder have higher rates of stressful life events, such as childhood abuse, marital problems and high levels of job stress. There is also evidence that they are relatively less aware of their own emotions and more reluctant to express their feelings, particularly anger.\n\nFor the new study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, Schubiner and his colleagues tested the effects of affective self-awareness — a technique Schubiner developed and uses in treating certain chronic-pain conditions — on fibromyalgia.\n\nThey randomly assigned 45 women with the condition to either undergo the therapy or go on a wait-list for treatment, serving as a control group. Women in the treatment group each had a one-on-one consultation, then attended three group meetings to learn the affective self-awareness techniques so that they could carry them out on their own.\n\nThe therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. They learn specific techniques — including mindfulness meditation and “expressive” writing — for recognizing and dealing with the emotions that may be contributing to their pain. Patients are also encouraged to get back to any exercise or other activities that they have been avoiding due to pain.\n\nSchubiner’s team found that six months later, 46 percent of the treatment group had at least a 30-percent reduction in their pain ratings compared with scores at the outset. And 21 percent had a 50-percent or greater reduction.\n\nNone of the women in the control group had a comparable improvement.\n\nThe study is only the first clinical trial to test affective self-awareness for fibromyalgia, and it had a number of limitations, including its small size. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison.\n\nThat is important because it is possible for patients to benefit from simply receiving attention from a healthcare provider, or being part of small-group sessions with other people suffering from the same condition, for example.\n\nSchubiner also acknowledged that this general “model” for understanding and addressing fibromyalgia pain is controversial.\n\nHe said that he and his colleagues have applied for funding to conduct a larger clinical trial comparing affective self-awareness with standard cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nAffective self-awareness and cognitive-behavioral therapy have similarities, according to Schubiner. Both, for example, try to show patients that they have the power to improve their own health.\n\nA key difference, Schubiner said, is that affective self-awareness asks people to “directly engage” the emotions that may be helping to drive their symptoms.\n\nAnother difference is that, right now, only a small number of healthcare providers practice affective self-awareness, according to Schubiner.\n\nSome components of the technique, such as teachings in mindfulness meditation, are more widely available. But whether those practices in isolation would help fibromyalgia patients’ pain is not clear.\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/bes55m\n\nJournal of General Internal Medicine, online June 8, 2010.']",This was a thorough and well balanced review of an emerging psychotherapy technique known as affective self-awareness therapy that is used to treat fibromyalgia pain.,"The story gets high marks for its evaluation of the evidence and especially for pointing out the limitations of psychotherapy studies that use a waiting list as a control group. The story would have been improved by the inclusion of some truly independent expert sources to comment on the research. Such experts may have emphasized that this ""new"" therapy may not differ very dramatically from existing psychotherapeutic approaches.

Tan, a member of the UCLA Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research in the Department of Neurology.\n\nThe study was published Tuesday in the print edition of the journal Neurology.\n\nTan and his colleagues compared blood levels of two nutrients in omega-3 fatty acids with MRI brain scans and cognitive tests. They found people in the bottom 25% scored lower on such mental tests as problem solving, multi-tasking and abstract thinking.\n\nTan said the MRI images showed those with lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids were also more likely to have minute but significant structural changes in the brain. The MRIs showed higher white matter hyperintensity volume, tiny lesions in the brain, raising the risk for death, stroke and dementia for the low omega-3 fatty acids group.\n\nTan said the results were consistent with signs of damage to the intricate network of blood vessels in the brain. A third of the brain by volume is composed of blood vessels.\n\nTan’s team studied 1,575 people with an average age of 67 who were free of dementia. They controlled for such risk factors as age, smoking, gender, body mass index, physical activity and APOE, the one known gene linked to dementia risk.\n\nTan said the next step in the research is to follow these people to see if the risk factors they observed translates into a higher rate of cognitive deterioration.\n\nFatty fish like salmon offer a concentrated source of the omega-3 fatty acid nutrients Tan and his colleagues looked at eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).\n\nVegetable and canola oils, soybeans, flaxseed, walnuts and vegetables including spinach, kale and salad greens are also a source of omega-3 fatty acids. These contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which the body partially converts to EPA and DHA.\n\nBoth types are thought to be beneficial. The typical American diet doesn't contain enough of either. Choose My Plate, the government’s dietary guidelines, recommends eating seafood twice a week.\n\n“This is an important new finding that supports omega-3 for brain health and brain size,” said Dr. Majid Fotuhi, chairman of the Neurology Institute for Brain Health and Fitness and assistant professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nFotuhi recommends his patients get 1,000 mg per day of DHA, a nutrient that increases blood flow in the brain, reduces inflammation in the brain, heart and elsewhere, and reduces the toxic aggregation of amyloid in the brain.\n\nDHA has the added benefit of improving mood and reducing symptoms of depression, he said. The only people who should avoid DHA are patients on a blood thinner like Cumadin, he added.\n\nNeurology, published weekly, is the official journal of the American Academy of Neurology.""]",This CNN story lagged behind the competing coverage from ,"The story didn’t include even a word about the limitations of the study, and it didn’t challenge many questionable claims about the benefits of DHA made by an expert source.

Physical therapy can be just as good for a common injury and at far less cost and risk, the most rigorous study to compare these treatments concludes.\n\nTherapy didn\'t always help and some people wound up having surgery for the problem, called a torn meniscus. But those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away, researchers found.\n\n""Both are very good choices. It would be quite reasonable to try physical therapy first because the chances are quite good that you\'ll do quite well,"" said one study leader, Dr. Jeffrey Katz, a joint specialist at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nHe was to discuss the study Tuesday at an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons conference in Chicago. Results were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA meniscus is one of the crescent-shaped cartilage discs that cushion the knee. About one-third of people over 50 have a tear in one, and arthritis makes this more likely. Usually the tear doesn\'t cause symptoms but it can be painful.\n\nWhen that happens, it\'s tough to tell if the pain is from the tear or the arthritis — or whether surgery is needed or will help. Knee surgery for a torn meniscus is done about half a million times each year in the U.S.\n\nThe new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option. Researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the U.S. assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or physical therapy. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success.\n\nAfter six months, both groups had similar rates of functional improvement. Pain scores also were similar.\n\nThirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn\'t helping them. Yet they ended up the same as those who got surgery right away, as well as the rest of the physical therapy group who stuck with it and averted an operation.\n\n""There are patients who would like to get better in a \'fix me\' approach"" and surgery may be best for them, said Elena Losina, another study leader from Brigham and Women\'s Hospital.\n\nHowever, an Australian preventive medicine expert contends that the study\'s results should change practice.

""My knee is virtually normal today."" He still does the recommended exercises several times a week.\n\nRobert Dvorkin had both treatments for injuries on each knee several years apart. Dvorkin, 56, director of operations at the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City, had surgery followed by physical therapy for a tear in his right knee and said it was months before he felt no pain.\n\nThen, several years ago, he hurt his left knee while exercising. ""I had been doing some stretching and doing some push-ups and I just felt it go \'pop.\'"" he recalls. ""I was limping. It was extremely painful.""\n\nAn imaging test showed a less severe tear and a different surgeon recommended physical therapy. Dvorkin said it worked like a charm — he avoided surgery and recovered faster than from his first injury. The treatment involved two to three hour-long sessions a week, including strengthening exercises, balancing and massage. He said the sessions weren\'t that painful and his knee felt better after each one.\n\n""Within a month I was healed,"" Dvorkin said.

It’s a process that’s undeniably inconvenient, yet one we’re told is unquestionably necessary.\n\nThat’s a shame. Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it’s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. And the drawbacks of colonoscopy — including the time commitment, not-so-fun preparation, expense and small chance of harm — are probably keeping some people from participating in colorectal cancer screening.\n\nAccording to public health experts, that’s a bad thing. The United States Preventive Services Task Force says the net benefit for screening adults age 50-75 is “substantial,” adding that colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the country. But as of 2012, just 65 percent of eligible adults were being screened as recommended, and almost 28 percent had never been screened.\n\nAmong those who are screened, colonoscopy is by far the most popular method in the U.S. But there is a menu of options beyond colonoscopies — and they’re not necessarily any better or worse, according to the USPSTF’s recently finalized updated recommendations for screening among average-risk adults. The group said that while some tests are backed by more evidence than others, it found no head-to-head studies suggesting any strategy — including colonoscopy — is better than another. “Choose the one that fits your preferences and lifestyle,” said Douglas Owens, a physician and member of the task force.\n\nIncluded on the list are two cheap, at-home poop tests intended to be done annually: the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and a more sensitive test called the fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. Both look for tiny amounts of blood in the stool that might be shed by cancer or polyps. You get one from your doctor, take a poop sample at home, and then return the sample to the doctor. Only if you get a positive result do you need to have a colonoscopy. (These are different from a new stool-based DNA test, which while on the USPSTF’s list is much more expensive and has been studied less.)\n\nOf the two, Richard Wender, a physician and chief cancer control officer of the American Cancer Society, said the FIT is preferable, both because it’s more accurate and because it requires only one poop sample and no changes in diet. It costs about $25 or less and when done every year, the USPSTF’s models estimate, it will avert 20-23 deaths from colorectal cancer per 1,000 people screened. (Wender doesn’t recommend the OTC tests that are available.)\n\nThat’s comparable to the two “scope” tests on the USPSTF’s list, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, which have the advantage of both detecting and removing precancerous polyps in one procedure. (Flexible sigmoidoscopy, which looks at the lower part of the large intestine, has been shown by randomized trials to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer but isn’t reimbursed as well as colonoscopy and is on the decline in the U.S.)\n\nColonoscopy is the most popular test in the U.S. In addition to its polyp-removing ability, if you have a negative test, you don’t have to come back for another 10 years. There is indirect evidence it reduces colorectal cancer deaths, in the form of a large study following people who did and didn’t get the test over time. And it seems logical that if sigmoidoscopy cuts colorectal cancer deaths, the more extensive colonoscopy must provide a similar benefit. But that’s not yet been proved by randomized controlled trials. Based on the available evidence and its modeling, the USPSTF estimates it reduces deaths from colorectal cancer by 22-24 per 1,000 people screened.\n\nBut that lack of trial data is why the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care earlier this year recommended against using colonoscopy as a first-line screening method. “They were very clear: We’re going to stick to the evidence, and right now we don’t have evidence for colonoscopy,” said Aasma Shaukat, section chief of gastroenterology in the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.\n\nColonoscopy also has plenty of downsides. It’s expensive, running upward of $1,000. (The test is covered without cost sharing as preventive care under the Affordable Care Act.) Most people prefer to have sedation during the procedure, which means time off from work and finding a ride home. There’s variation in the quality of the test, depending on who’s doing it. There’s a small but real risk of harm, such as a perforation.\n\nSo why do so many people prefer it to the poop test? For many, because they’ve been told it’s the best test to get. A 2012 study found primary care physicians overwhelmingly said they thought it was the best colorectal screening option. Katie Couric’s on-air colonoscopy in March 2000 boosted awareness and increased colonoscopy rates. There’s also a “more is better” attitude when it comes to medicine among many people, said Shaukat. And colonoscopies are well-reimbursed for the physicians who perform them. Hospitals have focused on marketing colonoscopies rather than alternative tests.\n\nNo one is arguing colonoscopy is a bad test. It just hasn’t been shown to be better than an annual FIT, said James Allison, a clinical professor of medicine emeritus at the University of California-San Francisco. He said the public health message is slowly changing to reflect that. The 80% by 2018 campaign from the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, for example, which aims to increase the rate of screening, emphasizes a suite of options. “People are very motivated to get screened when they hear colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death and if they know there are tests that are affordable and can be done at home,” said Wender.\n\nSo if you want a colonoscopy after talking with your physician and digging into all its pros and cons — fantastic. But if you prefer something less invasive but more frequent, you can test your poop every year without feeling like you’re opting for, um, No. 2.']","This write-up provided an excellent assessment of the at-home screening options for colon cancer, and why they’re a safe alternative to colonoscopy.","
This story points out that, based on available data, two at-home screening tests appear to be equally effective compared to the more traditional, and more invasive, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy.
We have only minor quibbles with the story–overall, it provided an excellent assessment of the at-home test options, particularly the fecal immunochemical test. However, for any story about screening methods, particularly blood tests, we think it’s important to include the risks of false-positive and false-negative results, which carry harm. The story didn’t go there.

But a new study suggests an existing medication may help.\n\nThe drug is oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), long used to treat urinary incontinence.\n\nThe study found that women taking the medicine had an average of five fewer hot flashes a week, compared with three fewer among women taking a placebo.\n\n""Oxybutynin is an option that can control these symptoms and improve quality of life,"" said lead researcher Dr. Roberto Leon-Ferre, an assistant professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons for severe hot flashes after breast cancer. Chemotherapy may induce early menopause, and drugs that reduce estrogen levels may make hot flashes worse, the research team noted.\n\nHormone replacement therapy, which is often recommended for menopausal symptoms, is generally not advised for breast cancer survivors. That\'s left women who can\'t take hormones at a disadvantage.\n\nOxybutynin blocks a substance in the brain, and one of its side effects is decreased sweating, Leon-Ferre noted.\n\n""Because of this, we can take advantage of the \'side effect\' and decrease involuntary sweating associated with hot flashes, and decrease the hot flashes as well,"" he explained.\n\nThe drug could be game-changing for certain women, said Dr. Alice Police, regional director of breast surgery at Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.\n\n""This is a really important advance in survivorship and compassionate cancer care,"" added Police, who wasn\'t involved in the study.\n\nBecause oxybutynin is already available for other conditions, Leon-Ferre said doctors could prescribe it off-label.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that its long-term effects aren\'t known. Drugs in this class -- called anticholinergics -- have been linked with mental decline, he said.\n\nFor example, the drugs may raise the risk for problems with short-term memory, reasoning and confusion, and may also hike the risk for dementia among older patients, studies indicate.\n\nFor the new study, Leon-Ferre and his colleagues randomly assigned 150 women who experienced at least 28 hot flashes a week to oxybutynin or a placebo.\n\nAlmost two-thirds were also taking drugs to prevent a return of breast cancer, either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.\n\nThe women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: low-dose oxybutynin twice a day for six weeks; low-dose oxybutynin for one week followed by an increased dose; or a placebo.\n\nBoth doses appeared to reduce hot flashes better than the placebo.\n\nAnd oxybutynin doesn\'t interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen, Leon-Ferre said, calling that an important consideration for breast cancer survivors.\n\nMost insurance covers oxybutynin, and a month\'s supply can range from $21 to $42. With insurance, copays would be less, he added.\n\nSide effects included constipation, mild diarrhea, dry mouth, dry eyes, episodes of confusion and difficulty urinating, the researchers found.\n\nWomen taking oxybutynin also reported improvement in work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep and overall quality of life.\n\nThese are vital issues, Police said. ""I will never forget the first time a patient said, \'Thank you for curing my breast cancer, but you ruined my life,\' "" she said.\n\nThe patient said endocrine therapy had caused hot flashes so severe that she could not sleep. As a result, she was having trouble at work and in all other aspects of her life, Police recalled.\n\n""Her intimate relationship was also suffering, as nighttime had become a battleground between her and her internal temperature control,"" Police said.\n\nThe patient said she was willing to stop her hormone therapy and risk the return of breast cancer rather than live with her current symptoms, she said.\n\n""This study makes me hopeful that these patients may have a way out of their dilemma,"" Police said. ""Instead of just telling them they should be happy to be alive, we may be able to offer a reliable treatment for some of the debilitating side effects of our treatments for breast cancer.""\n\nThe research was scheduled to be presented Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. Studies presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until peer-reviewed for publication in a medical journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more about hot flashes and cancer survivors.']",Did the study findings really earn a label of “game-changing?”,"The San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium typically generates extensive media coverage of new research studies. However, not all of the studies presented are of the same caliber and some will never undergo the peer review that will lead them to be published in a medical journal. This means reporters needs to be at the top of their game when evaluating the news releases they receive about studies that will be presented at the meeting.
This story from HealthDay does many things right — it covers costs, side effects, study limitations, and more. This earned it five stars from us. However, we do think the story would have been even stronger if it had better emphasized a key fact: The overall reduction in hot flashes was roughly 28 to 23 in the drug group and 28 to 25 in the placebo group.

People taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially those younger than 60, were less likely to develop the neurological disorder than those not using cholesterol drugs, the researchers found.\n\nNearly one million people in the United States have Parkinson\'s disease, a chronic and progressive movement disorder, and no one knows what causes it.\n\nThe researchers can\'t say exactly how -- or even if -- statins reduce the risk of Parkinson\'s. It\'s thought these drugs may have potent anti-inflammatory effects, which could protect the brain.\n\nThe study had some limitations, the authors acknowledged. For example, only about 70 percent of people who were taking drugs to lower cholesterol were actually on statins at the study\'s start.\n\nDr. Roy Alcalay, an assistant professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, said it is way too early to say that statins lower risk for Parkinson\'s disease. ""This is a promising avenue for future research,"" said Alcalay, an advisor for the Parkinson\'s Disease Foundation.\n\nBut there is some good news, he added. The data are compelling evidence that statins are not detrimental for people with or at risk of Parkinson\'s disease, he said. There was a concern that statins could be harmful as they might lower the level of coenzyme Q10 in the blood. Co-Q10, an antioxidant, is thought to have benefits for people with Parkinson\'s disease.\n\n""If you need to be on statins for your heart, it is not going to increase your risk for Parkinson\'s,"" Alcalay said.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about Parkinson\'s disease and its symptoms at the Parkinson\'s Disease Foundation.']","A cautious, concise piece that could have been improved with a little number crunching.","This story gave readers the essential information about the study’s design, its limitations and its implications for patients.

The children were given food and drinks totaling the same number of calories, fat, protein and carbohydrates as their typical diets.\n\nThe only change was their sugar intake: The researchers swapped foods high in added sugars, like pastries and sweetened yogurts, for options like bagels and pizza. This lowered dietary sugar from 28 percent to 10 percent, and fructose from 12 percent to 4 percent of total calories.\n\nAfter nine days, the researchers found a 33 percent drop in triglycerides, a type of fat tied to heart disease; a 49 percent reduction in a protein called apoC-III that is tied to high triglyceride levels; and large reductions in small, dense LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease.\n\nThough this study is small and short-term, it builds on this group’s previous research implicating added sugars as a contributor to metabolic disorders and heart disease.\n\n“Sugar calories are not like other carbohydrate calories,” said Dr. Robert Lustig, a co-author of the study and professor of pediatrics at Benioff Children’s Hospital at the University of California, San Francisco. “Without changing total carbohydrate, or fat, or protein, we were able to accomplish this enormous improvement in their cardiovascular risk factors,” unrelated to weight loss, he said.']","This brief blog post accurately conveys the findings of a study, but not much context is provided to help readers know what to do with the information.","Reducing sugar—but not calories—in the diets of a small group of children who have obesity led to substantial reductions in heart disease risk factors in only nine days, a new study shows. This brief New York Times Well blog post does a good job explaining these details, including the cautionary information that the study was small and of short duration.
But the cost of brevity is that it fails to offer readers the kinds of methodological and explanatory details that would have helped them judge the relatively cursory nature of the research. Instead, it encourages readers to view the study as part of a growing body of research by referring them to a longer and more detailed 2015 post about a study conducted by some of the same scientists.  Alas, a quick look at the methodological details suggests that both studies stem from the same group of child participants. It is not unusual for a single study to generate several research articles.  But one could make the argument here that holding such small studies in abeyance and waiting for the bigger picture would serve readers better. Including commentary from an independent expert also would have strengthened the post.

Evidence is evaporating,"['Kim Painter\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThe idea that alcohol might be good for our hearts and blood vessels is a popular one, right up there with the notion that chocolate is a health food.\n\nBut before you pour your next cocktail, beer or glass of wine, you should know this: the science suggesting a benefit has never been conclusive. And some experts believe the evidence is getting thinner all the time.\n\n""In health as elsewhere, if something looks too good to be true, it should be treated with great caution,"" says an editorial published this week in the medical journal BMJ. Mike Daube, professor of health policy at Curtin University in Australia, writes that the once-touted benefits of moderate drinking ""are now evaporating.""\n\nHis editorial accompanies a British study that finds death rates among moderate drinkers and non-drinkers are not different enough to suggest any real health benefits for drinkers. The only possible exception: women over age 65.\n\nAlso, a recent Swedish study found that middle-aged people having more than two drinks a day – just above the moderate level for men — had a markedly increased stroke risk.\n\nStudies will continue, and not everyone has given up the idea that moderate drinking — up to two drinks a day for men and one day for women — might have some cardiovascular benefits.\n\nHere\'s what U.S. experts say you need to know for now:\n\n• Any benefits are unclear. ""I cannot prove and I don\'t think anyone can prove that alcohol consumption can prevent anyone from dying or prevent heart attacks,"" says Kenneth Mukamal, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston. But he says some studies show moderate drinking can boost levels of ""good"" HDL cholesterol and a hormone key to blood sugar control. Some studies following moderate drinkers and non-drinkers for decades find lower death rates and fewer heart attacks and strokes in the drinkers, he says. But those studies do not prove alcohol is the reason for the differences. One theory, backed by the new British study: the results are skewed by the fact that some non-drinkers are former drinkers with health problems.\n\n• The risks are real. For some people, even moderate drinking is clearly risky. Those include people taking blood-thinning medicines and those with uncontrolled high blood pressure, says Curtis Rimmerman, a cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. Alcohol raises blood pressure and thins blood, he say. It\'s also a source of ""non-essential liquid calories,"" a big concern in an overweight nation, he says. And heavy drinking is not good for anyone: It has long been linked with stroke, heart failure and many non-cardiovascular hazards, including car crashes.\n\n• Gender matters. Women are advised to drink less than men, partly because they tend to be smaller. But that\'s not the only reason, says Lori Mosca, a professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical Center and a spokesperson for the American Heart Association. ""Our blood vessels have a different hormonal milieu,"" she says and women are more vulnerable to the anti-clotting effects of alcohol – something that could raise the risk of bleeding strokes. Another consideration: even light drinking is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, according the National Cancer Institute.\n\n• Age matters too. There\'s no evidence drinking in your 20s or 30s has any health benefits. ""At those ages, any benefit we get from moderate drinking is only to the extent that someone who is moderately drinking is not heavily drinking,"" Mukamal says.\n\n• There\'s probably nothing special about wine. ""About a decade ago, there was this myth that red wine was better than white wine and wine was better than beer and spirits,"" Mosca says. Studies have failed to prove any difference.\n\n""I don\'t want to be a killjoy,"" Mosca says. ""But I would never recommend alcohol as a preventative intervention.""\n\n""There may be some evidence that perhaps one glass with a meal is OK,"" says Demetrius Lopes, a neurological surgeon at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, and another spokesperson the heart association. ""But it\'s a slippery slope to saying \'OK, maybe two is better.\' I do think people don\'t know the dangers.""\n\nAlcohol guidelines:\n\nNo health agency or major medical group recommends drinking for health. But, if you do drink, groups including the American Heart Association and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend:\n\n• No more than two drinks a day for men.\n\n• No more than one drink a day for women (and none for pregnant women).\n\nA drink is:\n\n• 12 ounces of beer\n\n• 5 ounces of wine\n\n• 1.5 ounces of 80-proof spirits or 1 ounce of 100-proof spirits.']","A new study has cast doubt on the proposed benefits of moderate alcohol consumption. Using the results as a jumping off point, this story skeptically assesses the evidence and explores concerns about the alcohol/heart health hypothesis.","This reader-friendly piece successfully conveyed the main point of a new study: science linking alcohol consumption to heart health is inconclusive. Featuring plenty of independent sources and bolded bullet points addressing key caveats about alcohol-related research, the piece smartly counters the narrative that alcohol is unquestionably heart healthy. While the overall story is solid, a bit more detail about the new study’s design, findings, and limitations would have been helpful.

""Patients have painful and inflamed joints. They are also at increased cardiovascular risk, particularly if their rheumatoid arthritis is not controlled.""\n\nProfessor Babaeva\'s previous research showed that treatment with anticytokine drugs can decrease the activity of rheumatoid arthritis. Extra-low dose anti-TNFα reduced levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines including C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, TNF, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The effect was more apparent and developed earlier when patients were treated with a combination of anti-TNFα and anti-IFN?, both at extra-low doses.\n\nThe current study investigated the impact of the combination of drugs on cardiovascular events. It included 68 patients who had suffered from active rheumatoid arthritis for at least five years. Patients were randomised to receive the combination of anti-TNFα and anti-IFN? plus standard disease-modifying therapy (38 patients) or placebo plus standard therapy (30 patients). During the three year follow up period the investigators monitored rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and cardiovascular events.\n\nPatients taking the combination of anticytokines had a lower rheumatoid arthritis disease activity score, as measured by the DAS28,2 and more dramatic decreases in IL-1, IL-6 and TNFα than the group on standard therapy alone.\n\nThe incidence of cardiovascular events (unstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure) was more than double in the group on conventional disease-modifying drugs alone (37%) compared to those also taking the combination of anticytokines (13%).\n\nProfessor Babaeva said: ""Our findings suggest that the decreased rheumatoid arthritis disease activity with the combination of anticytokines translates into decreased cardiovascular risk. Rheumatoid arthritis promotes the development of cardiovascular disease in a number of ways. Therefore, decreasing disease activity may also reduce cardiovascular risk by slowing down or halting these processes.""\n\nFor example, rheumatoid arthritis is associated with dysfunction of the blood vessel lining (called endothelium), which leads to lipid accumulation in the artery wall, plaque formation and atherosclerosis. Increased disease activity is also linked with a pro-coagulant state in which patients are more prone to blood clots and thrombosis. Patients with active disease have an increase in molecules that promote inflammation, which has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn patients with hypertension, target blood pressure was reached in 71% of those taking the combination of anticytokines compared to just 32% of patients on standard therapy alone. Professor Babaeva said: ""This doesn\'t mean that the two drugs directly impact on blood pressure. But the combination can improve endothelial function and it could be that blood pressure is more stable when disease activity is low.""\n\n""We found that the combination of two anticytokines containing extra-low doses of antibodies against TNFα and IFN? can improve the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk,"" said Professor Babaeva.\n\nShe concluded: ""We do not think that all patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with this combination. In patients with highly active disease, the standard biologics are better at preventing severe complications such as progressive joint destruction and/or systemic manifestations (vasculitis, uveitis, involvement of internal organs). We recommend this new approach for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with moderate disease activity who are not receiving the standard biologics and who do not have severe complications.""\n\n###']",Release on immunotherapy benefits in reducing cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis more optimistic than warranted in preliminary study.,"This news release asserts that a study found that combining two biologic drugs which contain extra-low doses of antibodies against tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and interferon (IFN) can “improve the efficacy of standard rheumatoid arthritis therapy and decrease cardiovascular risk.” But the accuracy of that statement depends on what your definition of “cardiovascular risk” is. If your definition includes the risk of heart attacks and strokes (as it surely does for most people), then the statement is questionable at best. The release does not mention any of those outcomes and instead focuses on “unstable angina, severe hypertensive crisis, and deterioration of chronic heart failure.”
The news release is rich in mechanistic details, ie: how the treatments’ processes may help reduce markers of cardiovascular risk, but poor in important details of interest such as potential harms, costs and impacts on heart attacks or strokes.
Granted, it was a small study, but it would have benefited from appropriate caveats around the actual outcomes observed, the potential for harms, and an overall sense of context.

NEW STUDY SHOWS CANNABIS CAN REVERSE COGNITIVE DECLINE IN MICE,"['Marijuana appears to improve the memory and learning abilities of old mice. Scientists discovered low doses of its main psychoactive ingredient—cannabinoid THC—can reverse the age-related decline in cognitive abilities, a finding that could lead to scientists figuring out a way of slowing brain aging in humans.\n\nResearchers are increasingly examining THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) for its potential medical benefits. In the U.K., Oxford University recently launched a £10 million ($13 million) program to “identify new medical therapies through research into the molecular, cellular and systems mechanisms of cannabinoids.” Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has now approved several medications derived from THC.\n\nMany scientists are currently looking at its potential use as a treatment for neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.\n\nSubscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week\n\nIn a study published in Nature Medicine on Monday, researchers led by Andreas Zimmer, from the University of Bonn, Germany, have shown how THC can provide significant benefits to mice when it comes to age-related cognitive decline.\n\nTHC interacts with receptors in the brain’s endocannabinoid system, which is involved in many physiological functions, including pain, mood, memory and appetite. Previous research has also shown activity in the endocannabinoid system declines as we get older, indicating it plays a role in the progression of aging.\n\nTo study what effect THC has on the aging brain, scientists gave low doses of THC to mice at three different life stages—two months, 12 months and 18 months. The latter two groups represented mature and old age.\n\nThe team carried out three experiments. The first involved a water maze, where mice have to learn and then remember how to navigate their way to the end. In a control group, mature and old mice performed worse than the young group. However, when treated with THC, the older groups improved at the task, while the young mice fared far worse. (The study’s authors noted that this was in “good agreement with the known detrimental effects of THC on cognition in young animals and humans.”\n\nNext, they created a task where mice had to locate a specific object. Older mice treated with THC performed to the same standard as young mice that had not been given the drug. A third test relating to partner recognition also showed THC led to improved memory in mature and older mice. “Together, these results reveal a profound, long-lasting improvement of cognitive performance resulting from a low dose of THC treatment in mature and old animals,” the scientists write.\n\nJohn Vizcaino/Reuters\n\nFurther research showed what might cause the improvement, with THC appearing to restore hippocampal gene transcription patterns—activity in the brain relating to memory and learning—to a similar state seen in young mice.\n\nThe team argues that while they do not yet know if these findings would be same in humans, it could lead to new treatments to prevent cognitive decline in older people: “Cannabis preparations and THC are used for medicinal purposes,” they write. “They have an excellent safety record and do not produce adverse side-effects when administered at a low dose to older individuals. Thus, chronic, low-dose treatment with THC or cannabis extracts could be a potential strategy to slow down or even to reverse cognitive decline in the elderly.”\n\nZameel Cader, associate professor in clinical neurosciences at Oxford University, is involved in the institution’s $13 million cannabis research project. Commenting on the Nature Medicine study, he tells Newsweek the paper is “very interesting on a number of levels.”\n\n“First of all there’s clearly growing interest in the potential therapeutic role of cannabinoids and in this particular case THC on various human conditions,” he says. “This paper is addressing a possible role for that compound in memory and cognition, which is relevant to disorders such as Alzheimer’s and other dementias.”\n\nHe said that while it is important to remember the study was carried out on mouse models, the differences in the effect of the drug on younger animals versus older animals tells us a lot about our understanding of the differences between old and young brains.\n\nMoving this research forward, however, will be problematic: “Testing in humans is going to be difficult. This is a challenge faced by anyone wanting to develop a therapy for a human disorder such as dementia. Human lifespan is very extensive. So the question would be, when would be the most appropriate time to give these kinds of medications? Over what period of time do you need to evaluate the effects? In humans it could be years before an effect is noticed.”\n\n“Finally, there is the issue surrounding safety. With a cannabinoid like THC, which does have adverse effects in certain individuals, there would be worries about the chronic dosing of this kind of medicine. We would need to assess the safety first before going into seeing whether it would improve cognition.""']","The story goes into some detail about the substantial barriers to studying similar effects in people and offers explicit, attributed cautionary statements about marijuana’s potential adverse effects.","This Newsweek article describes a study designed to find and measure the effects of marijuana’s active chemical ingredient on learning and memory in mammals. In this case, it’s mice fed an indeterminate (from the story itself) amount of cannabinoid THC while young, middle-aged, and elderly, then tested at each stage on a trio of measures of rodent cognition.

To complicate matters, many migraine sufferers can also experience severe bouts of nausea and vomiting.\n\nAnother expert described the problem this way.\n\n""I\'ve had some patients where the nausea and vomiting was so bad they couldn\'t even swallow a pill,"" said Nancy Waltman, a nurse practitioner with the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Nursing, Lincoln Division.\n\nA nasal spray is available, as is an injection, but many patients aren\'t comfortable with these options, Khan and Waltman noted.\n\nKhan said the Zecuity patch is ""simple, efficient and can deliver the exact amount of dosage with minimal variability.""\n\nThe patch is attached to the upper arm or thigh, and when the patient pushes a button the drug is delivered through the skin. Zecuity, which is battery-operated, delivers 6.5 milligrams of sumatriptan over the course of about five hours and can relieve nausea, as well as reduce sensitivity to light and sound.\n\nNuPathe Inc., which makes Zecuity, hopes to have the patch on the market later this year.\n\nResearch involving 800 patients ultimately led to the approval of Zecuity.

Exactly how sleep apnea results in bedwetting is not fully understood, but hormonal changes may play a role.\n\nHowever, half of the 417 children in this latest study who had sleep apnea and were bedwetters stopped wetting the bed after they had their tonsils or adenoids removed. Children in the study were aged 5 to 18, and were followed for just under one year after their surgery, on average.\n\nThose who did not stop wetting the bed after the surgery were more likely to be born prematurely, be male, be obese or have a family history of bedwetting, the investigators noted. Premature birth was the greatest predictor of continued bedwetting after surgery.\n\n""If they haven\'t seen an ear, nose and throat specialist, see one to see if the child who wets the bed has OSA that can be cured by tonsil or adenoid removal,"" said study author Dr. Yegappan Lakshmanan, chief of pediatric urology at Children\'s Hospital of Michigan, in Detroit.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association (AUA), in Washington, D.C. Research presented at medical meetings should be viewed as preliminary until it has been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nThere are many other causes of bedwetting, Lakshmanan said. ""About 5 to 7 million children are bedwetters, and the causes fall into three main groups: bladder issues, sleep-related problems and the kidneys,"" he explained. ""The children in this study wet the bed due to sleep-related problems.""\n\nSo why weren\'t they all cured? ""Bedwetting is multifactorial even within these groups, and eventually we should be able to pinpoint the cause for every single child,"" Lakshmanan said.\n\n""There are several potential causes of bedwetting, and sleep apnea is clearly one of them,"" said Dr. Lane S. Palmer, chief of pediatric urology at the Cohen Children\'s Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.\n\n""There are secondary positive effects of this tonsil- or adenoid-removing surgery, but I don\'t know that I would jump to have my child\'s tonsils or adenoids out as a primary treatment for bedwetting,"" he said. ""Children with sleep apnea and bedwetting should see an otolaryngologist first.""\n\n""This study really underscores the fact that children who have other issues with sleep should be looked at for bedwetting because anything that depresses sleep at night can lead to bedwetting,"" said AUA spokesman Dr. Anthony Atala, a urologist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\n""If a child has bedwetting, pay close attention to their sleep patterns, and observe them while they are asleep and you can see whether they are breathing at a regular pace, and if not, seek additional help,"" Atala said.\n\nChildren with sleep apnea can be difficult to rouse, which may cause the bedwetting, said Dr. Dennis Kitsko, an otolaryngologist at the Children\'s Hospital of Pittsburgh. ""But not every child with sleep apnea will wet the bed, and not every bedwetter will have sleep apnea.""\n\nStill, ""snoring in children is abnormal,"" said Dr. Linda Dahl, an ear, nose and throat doctor at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""Children snore because their tonsils and adenoids are enlarged, and they end up getting other behaviors that go along with sleep apnea, including bedwetting,"" she explained.\n\n""There are many ancillary benefits that you may not attribute to removing large tonsil and adenoids, such as putting an end to bedwetting,"" Dahl added.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about bedwetting and its treatment at the Nemours Foundation.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This carefully and responsibly written story hit many of our marks and stands out especially for its ample use of independent sources to help readers sort through the evidence.</span>","The story also pointed out clearly that research presented at meetings has not yet been rigorously peer-reviewed and must be viewed in that light.

Symptoms including serious memory loss, confusion and mood changes develop gradually and worsen with time. Recently, many strides have been made in diagnosing Alzheimer\'s disease earlier, but doctors have been stymied by a lack of effective treatments to stop or slow the course of the disease.\n\nIt\'s long been known that a protein fragment called beta-amyloid builds up in the spaces between nerve cells in the brains of people with Alzheimer\'s disease. The new drug, gantenerumab, targets these amyloid proteins by priming the body\'s immune system to recognize them as invaders.\n\nOf 16 people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\'s disease, those who received two to seven infusions of the experimental drug every four weeks showed marked reductions in the amount of plaque in their brains via imaging tests that were conducted several months after their treatments.\n\nBy contrast, amyloid load increased among people who were randomized to receive the placebo. The new drug was given at either 60 or 200 milligrams (mg) doses. The higher dose yielded greater reductions in amyloid levels, the study showed. People who were given the 60 mg doses saw a nearly 16 percent reduction in the amount of amyloid, and those given the 200 mg doses saw a 36 percent reduction. The new study was conducted and funded by the drug\'s manufacturer, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe big question is whether or not reducing amyloid levels has any effect on the symptoms or progression of Alzheimer\'s disease, said Dr. Patrick Lyden, chief of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. ""There is a growing concern that amyloid is a guilty bystander, but not the actual culprit in the brains of people with Alzheimer\'s disease, and taking away the bystander may not help the patient,"" he said.\n\nThere are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer\'s disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. ""They are all extremely exciting and promising in animals,"" he said. ""This is the first one to show a preliminary result in people, but we have a huge way to go to make sure it is safe and improves symptoms.""\n\nMany in the Alzheimer\'s research community are awaiting these drugs with bated breath, but ""none are ready for prime time,"" he said.\n\nThe leading theory of Alzheimer\'s disease is that an imbalance in the production or clearance of the amyloid plaque in the brain initiates a cascade of events that lead to dementia, explained Dr. Neelum Aggarwal, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush Alzheimer\'s Disease Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\n""Accumulation of the plaques cause a variety of cellular responses: inflammation, neuronal death, and thus any potential treatment that can alter these processes would be beneficial,"" she said. The hope is that gantenerumab or other drugs like it will not only prevent amyloid from accumulating in the brain, but also slow down the cognitive impairment that occurs in people with Alzheimer\'s disease, she added.\n\nThat said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. ""The main issue that remains for this type of drug development is managing the immune response,"" Aggarwal said. Other side effects include a potentially fatal fluid build-up in certain areas of the brain. ""This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer\'s disease population,"" she said.\n\nIf any of these drugs make it through the pipeline, it also needs to be determined who will get them, including whether the drugs will be given to prevent Alzheimer\'s in patients at high-risk of the disease or to treat it once it\'s started.\n\nThe need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer\'s disease can\'t be underestimated, Aggrawal said. In the United States alone, there are 5.4 million people with Alzheimer\'s disease, and the numbers are expected to increase to 13 million by 2050, when approximately three of every five people over the age of 85 will have Alzheimer\'s disease, she said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information about Alzheimer\'s disease signs, symptoms and treatments, visit the Alzheimer\'s Association.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Although this story barely outscores its <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=4349"" target=""_blank"">WebMD competition</a>, we wish that both stories would learn from competitors’ different strong points. </span>","Overall, a solid job of reporting.

It kills 500,000 people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to 1.3 million people around the world.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">It’s difficult to understand how you can report on new research questioning the report of the US Preventive Services Task Force without including any reaction from anyone on the Task Force. </span>","This story reports on a new analysis of the scientific evidence used by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to make its 2009 recommendations regarding mammography screening.  The authors of the analysis, published online by the American Journal of Roentgenology, arrived at different conclusions than the Task Force’s recommendations.

So far there haven’t been any scientific publications detailing lives saved with the LifeVac or another device, from Dechoker LLC, of Salisbury, N.C.\n\nBoth the Dechoker, $89.95, and the LifeVac, $69.95, have a plastic mask that provides a seal over the mouth and nose while suction is provided. The Dechoker looks like a large syringe, while the LifeVac’s plunger is shaped like a small accordion. In both devices, one-way valves allow air to only travel out of the mask and not into it, which avoids pushing the object deeper in, says LifeVac Chief Executive Arthur Lih.\n\nWhile the devices “theoretically” could work, there isn’t enough evidence for them, says New Orleans physician Jay Kaplan, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians. There are a number of potential pitfalls, including whether a panicking choking victim would let a rescuer put a mask on the mouth, he adds.\n\nThe Dechoker looks like a large syringe. Photo: DECHOKER\n\nEarly adopters of the devices include people with chronic diseases at high risk for choking. “This is a very simple device which people can have on hand,” says Port Charlotte, Fla., neurologist William Holt. He says he recommends the LifeVac to his multiple-sclerosis patients, as the disease interferes with the muscular coordination involved in swallowing. Dr. Holt says he works as a volunteer adviser to LifeVac but has no financial link to the company.\n\nSkeptics include Dr. Heimlich, now 96. Such a device may not be handy in the “unexpected instance that a person chokes,” Dr. Heimlich, a retired thoracic surgeon from Cincinnati, says in a statement released by his son, Phil Heimlich. “Any action that delays use of the Heimlich maneuver or complicates the rescue can be deadly.”\n\nIf a person is choking and isn’t able to cough out the obstruction, the American Heart Association recommends a rapid sequence of abdominal thrusts. If that doesn’t work, or if you can’t get your arms around the victim, due to obesity or pregnancy, another option is thrusting around the chest area, adds Clifton Callaway, chairman of the AHA’s Emergency Cardiovascular Care committee. The American Red Cross recommends using five back blows, followed by five abdominal thrusts, repeating as needed.\n\nThe LifeVac and the Dechoker are both intended to be used if standard rescue treatments fail, the companies say. One person can get the device while another person starts the Heimlich maneuver, suggests Sean Pittman, Dechoker’s director of strategic development.\n\nThe American Heart Association, which last updated its guidelines on choking rescue in 2010, looks for published reports in scientific journals that a technique has a record of successful uses before recommending it, the group says.\n\nA recently published study showed that the LifeVac dislodged simulated obstructions. Photo: Lifevac\n\nOn the market less than two years, neither LifeVac nor Dechoker has published evidence of successful uses in humans. Two users have told Dechoker that the device successfully dislodged an obstruction, says Mr. Pittman. In a recent case of an elderly woman in Wales, the LifeVac removed an obstruction after standard treatments failed, says Mr. Lih. The company doesn’t yet have full details on the case, he adds.\n\nIn a study published online in March in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine, the LifeVac successfully removed test obstructions made of clay from the upper airway of a cadaver. “It worked 49 out of 50 times on the first try,” says study co-author Mimi Juliano, a Farmingdale, N.Y., speech pathologist who specializes in swallowing disorders. The one time the device failed on the first try, researchers didn’t have a good seal around the mouth, she says; it worked the second time.']","While the story doesn’t fully answer the question posed by its own headline, it makes an admirable presentation that is clear and balanced, checking off all of our criteria.","This is a story that looks at two devices that purport to be alternatives to the Heimlich maneuver for choking victims.
While the story doesn’t fully answer the question posed by its own headline, it makes an admirable presentation that is clear and balanced, checking off all of our criteria. In particular, the story establishes the cost and availability of the devices and interviews several independent sources.
However, since the devices might be offered as an alternative to the Heimlich maneuver, some discussion on their ease-of-use would have been nice, but is missing from the discussion, as well as what kind of safety testing these devices do or do not have to undergo compared to other emergency medical devices.

The results showed no differences in IQ.\n\n""There is growing evidence from a number of studies that all infants, those born at term and those born early, benefit from receiving extra blood from the placenta at birth,"" said Dr. Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom. Rabe\'s editorial accompanied the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nDelaying the clamping of the cord allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the infant, sometimes increasing the infant\'s blood volume by up to a third. The iron in the blood increases infants\' iron storage, and iron is essential for healthy brain development.\n\n""The extra blood at birth helps the baby to cope better with the transition from life in the womb, where everything is provided for them by the placenta and the mother, to the outside world,"" Rabe said. ""Their lungs get more blood so that the exchange of oxygen into the blood can take place smoothly.""\n\nPast studies have shown higher levels of iron and other positive effects later in infancy among babies whose cords were clamped after several minutes, but few studies have looked at results past infancy.\n\nIn this study, researchers randomly assigned half of 263 healthy Swedish full-term newborns to have their cords clamped more than three minutes after birth. The other half were clamped less than 10 seconds after birth.\n\nFour years later, the children underwent a series of assessments for IQ, motor skills, social skills, problem-solving, communication skills and behavior. Those with delayed cord clamping showed modestly higher scores in social skills and fine motor skills. When separated by sex, only the boys showed statistically significant improvement.\n\n""We don\'t know exactly why, but speculate that girls receive extra protection through higher estrogen levels whilst being in the womb,"" Rabe said. ""The results in term infants are consistent with those of follow-up in preterm infants.""\n\nDelayed cord clamping has garnered more attention in the past few years for its potential benefits to the newborn. Until recently, clinicians believed early clamping reduced the risk of hemorrhaging in the mother, but research hasn\'t borne that out.\n\nMuch of the research has focused on preterm infants, who appear to benefit most from delayed cord clamping, Rabe said. Preemies who have delayed cord clamping tend to have better blood pressure in the days immediately after birth, need fewer drugs to support blood pressure, need fewer blood transfusions, have less bleeding into the brain and have a lower risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, a life-threatening bowel injury, she said.\n\nThis study is among the few looking at healthy, full-term infants in a country high in resources, as opposed to developing countries where iron deficiency may be more likely.\n\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has not yet endorsed the practice, citing insufficient evidence for full-term infants. The World Health Organization recommends delayed cord clamping of not less than one minute.\n\nIt is unclear whether the practice could harm infants\' health. Some studies have found a higher risk of jaundice, a buildup of bilirubin in the blood from the breakdown of red blood cells. Jaundice is treated with blue light therapy and rarely has serious complications.\n\nAnother potential risk is a condition called polycythemia, a very high red blood cell count, said Dr. Scott Lorch, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and director of the Center for Perinatal and Pediatric Health Disparities Research at Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n""Polycythemia can have medical consequences for the infant, including blood clots, respiratory distress and even strokes in the worst-case scenario,"" Lorch said. Some studies have found higher levels of red blood cells in babies with delayed cord clamping, but there were no complications.\n\nLorch also pointed out that this study involved a mostly homogenous population in a country outside the U.S.\n\n""We should see whether similar effects are seen in higher-risk populations, such as the low socioeconomic population, racial and ethnic minorities and those at higher risk for neurodevelopmental delay,"" Lorch said.\n\nSo far, studies on delayed cord clamping have excluded infants born in distress, such as those with breathing difficulties or other problems. But Rabe said these infants may actually benefit most from the practice.\n\nThese babies often need more blood volume to help with blood pressure, breathing and circulation problems, Rabe said. ""Also, the placental blood is rich with stem cells, which could help to repair any brain damage the baby might have suffered during a difficult birth,"" she added. ""Milking of the cord would be the easiest way to get the extra blood into the baby quickly in an emergency situation.""']",Inclusion of potential harms and more expert context elevate this story above the competing ,"This story does a better job than a competing USA Today story at explaining why a delay in cutting the umbilical cord between newborn and Mom might give a modest boost to a child’s development four years later. Both stories describe a journal article that showed small improvements in fine-motor skills for children whose cords were left attached for three minutes compared to just ten seconds. This story provides more context and includes some limitations of the study on only 263 children, and discusses potential harms of waiting vs. immediate clamping. We’d like to have seen more numbers included in the description of benefits, and a discussion of why the high dropout rate in this study might have biased the results.

But are they receiving it?\n\nWhen it comes to learning about the differences in risk among certain types of nicotine products, many government websites are actually misleading or under-informing the public, according to two researchers who analyzed the content of numerous health websites.\n\nThis ""information quarantine"" in turn helps explain the woeful lack of public knowledge about relative risks, violating basic consumer rights as well as the public health principles of individual rights and health literacy, the researchers say.\n\n\n\nWriting in the International Journal of Drug Policy, Lynn Kozlowski of the University at Buffalo and David Sweanor of the University of Ottawa point out that many websites omit information showing that products such as e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and snus are far less harmful than traditional cigarettes.\n\n“Public health ethics always has a concern to avoid any net harm to population health,” explains Kozlowski, professor of community health and health behavior at UB and the paper’s lead author.\n\n“The fear has been that much safer tobacco and nicotine products like snus, smokeless tobacco and vape will possibly cause a net loss to public health because more people will use these products and these products may lead to cigarette use. This fear, however, is not based on actual evidence and cannot be used to suppress or otherwise keep the public uninformed of what is clearly known about the lower risks of these products,” adds Kozlowski, PhD, one of the world’s leading researchers on smoking behavior.\n\nAn information quarantine functions similarly to a medical quarantine – think of your favorite zombie movie or television show in which the infected person is secluded from everyone else to protect the overall public. In order to justify a quarantine, there has to be clear evidence that the need to protect population health should overrule personal autonomy.\n\nIn the case of providing information on differential health risks of nicotine products, “The evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources,” Kozlowski says.\n\nKozlowski and Sweanor reviewed several major health websites — including the CDC, Mayo Clinic, American Cancer Society, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Cancer Institute — and found three types of examples of information on smokeless tobacco, “but no-to-modest efforts to inform consumers of the significantly lower risks compared to cigarettes for lifelong users,” the researchers write.\n\nIn fact, they found that the Mayo Clinic perpetuated a misrepresentation discovered in 2003 — erroneously informing visitors that smokeless tobacco was as dangerous as cigarettes. The day after the article was released, the Mayo Clinic removed the headline, replacing it with the still misleading statement that smokeless tobacco was “not a safe product.”\n\n“People can only make as good a decision as the information available to them allows,” said Sweanor, an adjunct professor in the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of Law who has spearheaded the development of world-leading tobacco control initiatives in Canada since the early 1980s.\n\n“The public is dramatically misinformed about the relative risks of substitutable tobacco and nicotine products. The risk differentials are huge, but this is simply not known by a vast majority of those whose lives are at risk,” adds Sweanor.\n\nEngland has an example of a website — Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) — that gets it right on vaping, the researchers said. A briefing posted on the site specifically states: “Compared to tobacco products, electronic cigarettes are significantly safer.”\n\nIn their paper, the researchers note that information on comparative risks is common for other products and activities, like over-the-counter medicines and even safety ratings of vehicles.\n\nThey argue that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates the sale of tobacco products, isn’t doing its part to inform consumers of important differences in harm among tobacco products.\n\nTo illustrate their point, Kozlowski and Sweanor use the example that if one type of alcoholic beverage caused 3 in 5 regular users to die prematurely — as is the case with smoking traditional cigarettes — while another caused massively fewer deaths, consumers would want to know which product was the safer alternative.\n\n“It would be scandalous, even criminal, to keep such facts from consumers,” the researchers write. “Yet, such facts are being kept from adult consumers of legal tobacco/nicotine products, either by not informing or actively misinforming consumers. It is as if tobacco consumers were blindfolded and not allowed to see dramatic differences in harm from different products.”']",This news release states that the public isn’t getting all available health information on smokeless tobacco products. Giving us some examples would have been a better service than scolding those accused of withholding information.,"This news release raises important and fair questions about how forthcoming agencies purporting to serve the public health should be in detailing relative risk when comparing one perceived societal ill against another. In this case, we are talking about smoking versus smokeless tobacco products including snus, smokeless tobacco and vape.
The source study, which includes a brief content analysis component, is less a traditional medical study and more a philosophy or ethics discussion of the principles involved in withholding or disclosing information to the public that has implications about health benefits and risks.
But the news release fails to be as even-handed as it might be. For example, it points an accusing finger at the American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Mayo Clinic, but fails to get a response from any of them (even though the study itself does include a response from CDC as well as an acknowledgment by ACS that smoking tobacco is more dangerous than using smokeless products).
And it fails to quantify what is known — and not known — about the relative risk of using cigarettes versus smokeless tobacco.

Currently, no drug medications can successfully treat chronic neurodegenerative disease, but certain medicines can help alleviate symptoms or slow down the progression.\n\nResearchers, who conducted the study on mice, found that mefenamic acid — a common Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) used to relieve menstrual pain — can completely reverse memory loss and brain inflammation that are hallmark changes of Alzheimer’s, which currently affects over five million Americans.\n\nFor the study, researchers used 20 transgenic mice that develop symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The research was conducted when mice had developed memory problems. They were divided in groups of 10. First group was given mefenamic acid dose and the other group was given placebo for one month through a mini-pump implanted under the skin.\n\nResearchers observed that memory loss was fully reversed to the levels seen in mice without Alzheimer’s.\n\n“There is experimental evidence now to strongly suggest that inflammation in the brain makes Alzheimer’s disease worse. Our research shows for the first time that mefenamic acid, a simple [NSAID] can target an important inflammatory pathway called the NLRP3 inflammasome, which damages brain cells,” David Brough, lead author of the study said, in a statement.\n\nBrough, however, cautioned that further research is required to identify its impact on humans and the long-term implications.\n\n“However, much more work needs to be done until we can say with certainty that it will tackle the disease in humans as mouse models don't always faithfully replicate the human disease. Because this drug is already available and the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the drug is known, the time for it to reach patients should, in theory, be shorter than if we were developing completely new drugs,” Brough said.\n\nResearchers said that the lab results identify a class of existing drugs that are likely to treat Alzheimer’s by blocking a particular part of the immune response. But, they also warned that these “drugs are not without side effects and should not be taken for Alzheimer’s disease at this stage - studies in people are needed first.”\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Communications on Thursday.""]",Story framing takes mice evidence too far into “cure” territory.,"
This is a story about a potential new treatment for Alzheimer’s disease–although the story sensationalizes mouse research to a degree we don’t see often at HealthNewsReview.org.
These errors seem to stem from an over-reliance on a news release and a lack of critical thinking about the qualify of the evidence from a University of Manchester study. The story could lead readers to think that a cure for Alzheimer’s is imminent, saying in the first sentence, “Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, can be fully cured with an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for period pain.”
The facts show that the truth is far from what is described. The research was highly experimental, only a proof-of concept, and performed on a tiny number of genetically altered mice.

Naloxone is a prescription drug that can reverse the effects of prescription opioid and heroin overdose, and can be life-saving if administered in time.\n\nAccording to the study findings, advanced EMS staff were more likely than basic EMS staff to administer naloxone. A majority of states have adopted national guidelines that prohibit basic EMS staff from administering the drug as an injection. As of 2014, only 12 states allowed basic EMS staff to administer naloxone for a suspected opioid overdose; all 50 states allow advanced EMS staff to administer the overdose reversal treatment.\n\n“Opioid overdose deaths are devastating families and communities, especially in rural areas,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. “Many of these deaths can be prevented by improving prescribing practices to prevent opioid addiction, expanding the use of medication-assisted treatment, and increasing use of naloxone for suspected overdoses. Having trained EMS staff to administer naloxone in rural areas will save lives.”\n\nTo reduce opioid overdose deaths, particularly in rural areas, CDC recommends expanding training on the administration of naloxone to all emergency service staff, and helping basic EMS personnel meet the advanced certification requirements.\n\n“Naloxone can be given nasally to a person suspected of overdose, allowing basic EMS staff to administer the drug without injection,” said CDC Senior Health Scientist Mark Faul, Ph.D., M.A. “Naloxone is non-addictive, and expanding training on how to administer the drug can help basic emergency medical service staff reverse an opioid overdose and save more lives.”\n\nNational Emergency Medicine Service Information System data for 2012 were reviewed to better understand factors associated with naloxone administration, including demographic data, 911 call information, and details about the scene of an injury or illness as reported by EMS staff.\n\nThe findings indicate naloxone was most likely to be administered to women, people between the ages of 20 and 29, and people living in suburban areas.\n\nIn general, the rate of opioid overdose death was 45 percent higher in rural areas compared with urban areas. The use of naloxone by rural EMS staff, however, was only 22.5 percent higher when compared with urban EMS naloxone use.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell has made addressing opioid abuse, dependence, and overdose a priority and work is underway at multiple HHS agencies on this important issue. HHS’ Health Resources Services Administration recently released a grant opportunity aimed at reducing opioid overdose deaths in rural communities through funding for communities to purchase naloxone and train health care professionals and emergency medical staff on its use.\n\nCDC works with states, communities, and prescribers to prevent opioid misuse and overdose by tracking and monitoring the epidemic and helping states scale up effective programs. CDC also improves patient safety by equipping health care providers with data, tools, and guidance so they can make informed treatment decisions. Learn more at www.cdc.gov/DrugOverdose.\n\n###\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESexternal icon']",This confusing release begs more questions than it answers about why states should allow emergency medical staff with less training to administer a drug that can reverse the effects of prescription opioid and heroin overdose.,"This news release from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocates for wider use of the opioid antidote naloxone (narcan) among basic emergency medical staff to help prevent overdose deaths. But the argument it makes is confusing and not very well supported by the data in the study being reported on. The release tells us that there are “national guidelines that prohibit basic EMS staff from administering the drug as an injection” and that the “majority of states have adopted” these guidelines. But it never says why, which presumably is key to understanding the potential benefit versus the risks of allowing a broader group of EMS staff to administer the drug, even if doing so through nasal spray and not injection.
It can be argued that restrictions on the use of naloxone are based mainly on historical precedent rather than legitimate concerns about harms of wider use. In fact, the drug is increasingly handed out for use by family and friends of substance users at risk of overdose. But the release lacks this crucial context, and the study it describes can’t tell us whether relaxing restrictions on use of naloxone by EMTs would make a difference in health outcomes.
THE BIG ISSUE here is that this is a public health news release about advocacy for the use of naloxone, but the study does not demonstrate efficacy, and is not really about that. The study is important in demonstrating that naloxone is not provided as frequently by lower-level emergency staff, and that there exists potential for more administration if they were trained or otherwise permitted to use the drug. It is a leap to associate this with changing mortality rates; however, there is face validity in the proposition.

The National Institute of Mental Health recently sponsored its first study of neurofeedback for A.D.H.D.: a randomized, controlled trial of 36 subjects.\n\nThe results are to be announced Oct. 26 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. In an interview in the summer, the study’s director, Dr. L. Eugene Arnold, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Ohio State, noted that there had been “quite a bit of improvement” in many of the children’s behavior, as reported by parents and teachers.\n\nDr. Arnold said that if the results bore out that neurofeedback was making the difference, he would seek financing for a broader study, with as many as 100 subjects.\n\nJohn Kounios, a professor of psychology at Drexel University, published a small study in 2007 suggesting that the treatment speeded cognitive processing in elderly people. “There’s no question that neurofeedback works, that people can change brain activity,” he said. “The big questions we still haven’t answered are precisely how it works and how it can be harnessed to treat disorders.”\n\nPhoto\n\nRussell A. Barkley, a professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina and a leading authority on attention problems, has long dismissed claims that neurofeedback can help. But Dr. Barkley says he was persuaded to take another look after Dutch scientists published an analysis of recent international studies finding significant reductions in impulsiveness and inattention.\n\nStill, Dr. Barkley cautioned that he had yet to see credible evidence confirming claims that such benefits can be long lasting, much less permanent.\n\nAnd another mainstream expert is much more disapproving. William E. Pelham Jr., director of the Center for Children and Families at Florida International University, called neurofeedback “crackpot charlatanism.” He warned that exaggerated claims for it might lead parents to favor it over proven options like behavioral therapy and medication.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNeurofeedback was developed in the 1960s and ’70s, with American researchers leading the way. In 1968, M. Barry Sterman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, reported that the training helped cats resist epileptic seizures. Dr. Sterman and others later claimed to have achieved similar benefits with humans.\n\nThe findings prompted a boomlet of interest in which clinicians of varying degrees of respectability jumped into the field, making many unsupported claims about seeming miracle cures and tainting the treatment’s reputation among academic experts. Meanwhile, researchers in Germany and the Netherlands continued to explore neurofeedback’s potential benefits.\n\nA major attraction of the technique is the hope that it can help patients avoid drugs, which often have side effects. Instead, patients practice routines that seem more like exercising a muscle.\n\nBrain cells communicate with one another, in part, through a constant storm of electrical impulses. Their patterns show up on an electroencephalogram, or EEG, as brain waves with different frequencies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These issues, they say, can be represented on a “brain map,” the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Subsequently, a clinician will help a patient learn to slow down or speed up those brain waves, through a process known as operant conditioning. The brain begins by generating fairly random patterns, while the computer software responds with encouragement whenever the activity meets the target.\n\nDr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of “The Brain That Changes Itself” (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback “a powerful stabilizer of the brain.” Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims. Robert Coben, a neuropsychologist in Massapequa Park, N.Y., said he had treated more than 1,000 autistic children over the past seven years and had conducted a clinical study, finding striking reductions in symptoms, as reported by parents.\n\nMaureen and Terrence Magagnos of Lynbrook, N.Y., took their 7-year-old son, Peter, to Dr. Coben after he was given a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder in first grade. “He had classic symptoms of autism,” said Mr. Magagnos. “His speech was terrible, he made very little eye contact and he screamed for attention — literally screamed.”\n\nPhoto\n\nTheir exceptionally generous insurance covered neurofeedback, so they decided to give it a try, with sessions twice a week for the next five years.\n\nAt the start of the treatment, Dr. Coben said, he discovered that Peter had been suffering tiny, asymptomatic seizures. He says neurofeedback helped stabilize the child’s brain activity, eliminating the seizures. And within three months, said Mr. Magagnos, a retired police officer, Peter’s teachers were calling to report remarkable improvements.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Today I’d say he has ‘autism light,’ ” he added. “He still has some symptoms, but he is much more manageable.”\n\nWhether such results can be achieved with other children is a matter of debate. Still, as practitioners lobby for broader acceptance, including insurance recognition, a sure sign of neurofeedback’s increasing popularity is the number of companies selling supposedly mind-altering systems to use at home.\n\nWith names like SmartBrain Technologies and the Learning Curve Inc., they offer equipment purported, respectively, to “pump the neurons” and “make lasting changes in attention, memory, mood, control, pain, sleep and more.”\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration regulates all biofeedback equipment as medical devices. The only approved use, however, is for “relaxation.”\n\nPeter Freer, a former grade-school teacher who is chief executive of a North Carolina firm called Unique Logic and Technology, says that since he began his business in 1994, he has sold several thousand of his “Play Attention” systems, advertised to improve a child’s focus, behavior, academic performance and social behavior.\n\nThe equipment, which costs $1,800, is advertised as “a sophisticated advancement of neurofeedback.” Mr. Freer says his clients include more than 600 school districts. (He adds that his system, as distinct from “clinical” neurofeedback, aims not to change brain waves but rather to put the user in an “attentive state” that makes it easier to learn skills.) Neurofeedback in general is a largely unregulated, with practitioners often devising their own protocols about where on the scalp to place electrodes. Results vary widely, and researchers caution that it is extremely important to choose one’s practitioner with care.\n\nWhen it comes to to the actual devices, Dr. Kerson, at the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, cautioned that they should never be used without experienced supervision.\n\n“Oftentimes what people do is find a way to get one of these machines on eBay and use it at home,” she said, adding that unskilled use could interfere with medications or prompt an anxiety attack or a seizure.\n\n“Neurofeedback is a powerful therapy,” she said, “and should be treated that way.”""]","This story is mostly a ""he-said-she-said"" exchange that gives equal billing to proponents and skeptics of neurofeedback treatment for a dizzying array of ailments. Readers deserve stories that make clear the state of the evidence about medical treatments. ","This is a story about a purported surge in the popularity of neurofeedback to treat a host of neurological ills, despite a chronic lack of large, well-controlled trials to provide reliable evidence about benefits and harms. The existence of a single, small trial sponsored by the NIH (involving a mere 36 children with ADHD) hardly demonstrates that the treatment is ""gaining attention from mainstream researchers."" The story could have done a better job of highlighting that support for this treatment comes primarily from those with a financial interest in its popularity.
This story did provide information suggesting that neurofeedback is not an effective treatment.  It erred in spending too much time suggesting that it might be of benefit when there is a complete absence of data to support such claims. While the headline of this story is slanted, on the plus side, it includes comments from many experts with a variety of perspectives.

Currently many women with a gene mutation choose surgical removal of their breast tissue and ovaries to reduce their chance of developing breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nBy pinpointing the cells that give rise to breast cancers in women who have inherited a faulty version of the BRCA1 gene, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute researchers have identified that the drug denosumab may have potential to prevent breast cancer from developing. If confirmed in clinical studies, this would provide a non-surgical option to prevent breast cancer in women with elevated genetic risk.\n\nUsing samples of breast tissue donated by women carrying a faulty BRCA1 gene, Ms Emma Nolan, Professor Jane Visvader and Professor Geoff Lindeman were able to pinpoint the cells that give rise to breast cancer. The research, which also involved researchers at the Australian familial cancer consortium kConFab and US biotechnology company Amgen was published today in Nature Medicine.\n\nCancer precursor cells in BRCA1-mutant breast tissue had many similarities to aggressive forms of breast cancer, said Ms Nolan, who is a PhD student at the institute enrolled through The University of Melbourne\'s Department of Medical Biology. ""These cells proliferated rapidly, and were susceptible to damage to their DNA - both factors that help them transition towards cancer,"" she said. ""We were excited to discover that these pre-cancerous cells could be identified by a marker protein called RANK.""\n\nProfessor Lindeman, who is also a medical oncologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the discovery of RANK as a marker of cancer precursors was an important breakthrough, because inhibitors of the RANK signalling pathway were already in clinical use. ""An inhibitor called denosumab is already used in the clinic to treat osteoporosis and breast cancer that has spread to the bone,"" he said. ""We therefore investigated what effect RANK inhibition had on the cancer precursor cells in BRCA1-mutant breast tissue.""\n\nThe research team showed that RANK inhibition switched off cell growth in breast tissue from women with a faulty BRCA1 gene and curtailed breast cancer development in laboratory models.\n\n""We think this strategy could delay or prevent breast cancer in women with an inherited BRCA1 gene mutation,"" Professor Lindeman said. ""A clinical trial has already begun to investigate this further.""\n\n""This is potentially a very important discovery for women who carry a faulty BRCA1 gene, who have few other options. Current cancer prevention strategies for these women include surgical removal of the breasts and/or ovaries, which can have serious impacts on people\'s lives. To progress this work, denosumab would need to be formally tested in clinical trials in this setting as it is not approved for breast cancer prevention,"" Professor Lindeman said.\n\nProfessor Visvader said the discovery had its basis in more than a decade of investigations of breast stem cell function. ""By thoroughly dissecting how normal breast tissue develops, we have been able to pinpoint the precise cells that are the culprits in cancer formation,"" she said. ""It is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the \'holy grail\' of cancer research, devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk.""\n\nThe research team worked closely with Mrs Avis Macphee, a patient advocate, through the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute\'s consumer-researcher buddy system. The research was supported by The National Breast Cancer Foundation, The Qualtrough Cancer Research Fund, The Joan Marshall Breast Cancer Research Fund, the Australian Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Council Victoria, the Cancer Therapeutics Cooperative Research Centre, an Amgen Preclinical Research Program Grant, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Victorian Cancer Agency, and the Victorian Government Operational Infrastructure Support Scheme.\n\n###\n\nThe Walter and Eliza Hall Institute is the research powerhouse of the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, an alliance of leading Victorian hospitals and research centres committed to controlling cancer.']",There’s a lost ,"The news release focuses on the potential of a drug called denosumab to prevent breast cancer from developing in women who have a BRCA1 gene mutation that makes them more likely than the general population to develop breast cancer. The relevant research was published in Nature Medicine. However, the release has some significant flaws. For example, it refers to a “holy grail” of breast cancer prevention for high-risk women, only noting much lower in the release that the work has yet to be proven in clinical studies. Further, even if denosumab does prove to be effective in reducing breast cancer risk for women with the BRCA1 mutation, that would not mean that all “high-risk women” would benefit; there are other genetic mutations — such as BRCA2 and other less common mutations — that can increase breast cancer risk. The release also neglects to address well-known health risks associated with denosumab use.

The vaccine has been tested, but never under real-world conditions in regular doctors’ offices.\n\nThe study, led by Hung Fu Tseng, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, compared about 75,000 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente Health plan with about 225,000 similarly aged members who weren’t vaccinated.\n\n“We didn’t know how well the vaccine actually performed in the community setting,” Tseng told Reuters Health.\n\nShingles is a viral disease produced by the chicken pox virus, a common childhood disease, and is characterized by pain and a blistering rash along the nerves that have housed the dormant virus.\n\nMost shingles patients are older adults, but people with a weak immune system or those under stress may also develop it.\n\nEveryone in the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was at least 60 years old, and the researchers didn’t include anybody for whom the live vaccine is not recommended.\n\nUsing electronic health records, researchers tracked patients for up to three years after vaccination.\n\nAbout six out of every 1,000 people vaccinated got shingles each year, compared to 13 of every 1,000 unvaccinated patients.

The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\nThe study, from which headline results were reported in October 2015, showed that the two-dose candidate shingles vaccine had 90% efficacy (95% confidence interval: 84-94%) compared to placebo in people over 70 years old. Vaccine efficacy was maintained across the various age groups included in the study, ranging between 90% in people aged 70-79 years (95% confidence interval: 83-94%) and 89% in those aged 80 years and above1 (95% confidence interval: 74-96%)1.\n\nThe high efficacy is in line with the results of the ZOE-50 trial, a study in people over 50 years old which was presented and published last year showing a 97% efficacy (95% confidence interval: 93-99%)2. A pooled analysis of data from both trials showed the vaccine demonstrated 91% efficacy against shingles (95% confidence interval: 86-95%) in adults aged 70 years and older compared to placebo1. This efficacy was maintained with an 88% reduction in the risk of shingles (95% confidence interval: 73-95%) in the fourth year after vaccination.\n\nThe risk of serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases or deaths observed in ZOE-70 was similar in people receiving Shingrix and placebo. The most commonly reported local adverse reaction was pain at the injection site and the most frequently reported systemic adverse reaction was fatigue. The majority of injection site and systemic reactions occurred within seven days of vaccination, with most lasting 1-3 days, and generally were mild-to-moderate in intensity1.\n\nIn addition, a pooled analysis of data from the ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 trials showed that the candidate vaccine effectively reduced the risk of subsequent chronic neuropathic pain, also known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)1 which is the most common, and often severe, complication of shingles3,4. The candidate vaccine was shown to be 89% (95% confidence interval: 68-97%) efficacious in preventing PHN in people aged 70 years and older and 91% efficacious (95% confidence interval: 75-98%) in people aged 50 years and over1.\n\nDr Emmanuel Hanon, Senior Vice President, Vaccines Research and Development, GSK, said: ""This is the first time that such high efficacy has been demonstrated in a vaccine candidate for older people and it is remarkable, as we know that these people frequently have an age-related weakening of their immune system. If approved, this candidate vaccine could be an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it, which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people.""\n\nAnthony Cunningham, Executive Director of the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Australia and Principal Investigator of the ZOE-70 study said: ""These data show that this investigational vaccine maintains high efficacy against herpes zoster in people over 70 and 80 years of age, the age groups who are most affected by the disease. Importantly, it also prevents a common and feared complication of herpes zoster, prolonged pain, or post herpetic neuralgia in these groups.""\n\nBased on these and the previously reported ZOE-50 data2, GSK expects to start submitting regulatory applications for the candidate vaccine for the prevention of shingles in people 50 years and above later this year.\n\nAbout Shingrix\n\nShingrix is a non-live, adjuvanted, subunit (HZ/su) candidate vaccine to help prevent herpes zoster and its complications. The candidate vaccine combines glycoprotein E, a protein found on the varicella zoster virus (VZV) that causes shingles, with an adjuvant system, AS01 B , which is intended to enhance the immunological response to the antigen5.\n\nAdditional trials to evaluate the ability of Shingrix to help prevent shingles are ongoing in healthy people aged 50 and older and in adults with compromised immune systems. These studies will provide additional information with respect to the efficacy and safety profile of the candidate vaccine as well as its ability to stimulate immune responses in other populations and in specific circumstances.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nThe name Shingrix is not yet approved for use by regulatory authorities in most countries, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n\n\nAbout the ZOE-70 trial\n\nThe ZOE-70 (ZOster Efficacy in adults aged 70 years and over) (NCT01165229) study is a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution) multicentre, multinational (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific) phase III trial involving more than 14,800 adults aged 70 years and older. Two doses were given intramuscularly two months apart. The study, which started in August 2010 in parallel with the ZOE-50 trial, includes subjects in the age ranges 70-79 and ≥80 years. The primary objective of ZOE-70 is overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people 70 years and over, compared to placebo. The co-primary objectives of the pooled analysis over both studies are the assessment of overall vaccine efficacy in reducing the risk of developing shingles and PHN in people aged 70 years and over, using pooled data from both ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 studies.\n\nAbout the ZOE-50 trial\n\nThe ZOE-50 (ZOster Efficacy in adults aged 50 years and over) (NCT01165177) study is a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution) multicentre, multinational (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific) phase III trial involving 16,160 adults aged 50 years and older. The study started in August 2010. Two doses were given intramuscularly two months apart. The primary objective of this study is the overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people aged 50 years or older, compared to placebo. The study includes subjects in the age ranges 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and ≥80 years.\n\nAbout the phase III study programme\n\nInvolving more than 37,000 subjects globally, the phase III programme for GSK\'s candidate shingles vaccine evaluates its efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. In addition to older adults, the candidate vaccine is being evaluated in immunocompromised patient populations, including solid and haematological cancer patients, haematopoietic stem cell and renal transplant recipients and HIV-infected people.\n\n\n\nAbout shingles\n\nShingles typically presents as a painful, itchy rash that develops on one side of the body, as a result of reactivation of latent chickenpox virus (varicella zoster virus, VZV). Anyone who has been infected with VZV is at risk of developing shingles, with age and altered immune system being recognised as the main risk factors3,4. Complications from shingles can include PHN, (the most common complication), scarring, vision complications, secondary infection and nerve palsies3,4.PHN is often defined as a localized pain of significant intensity persisting at least 90 days after the appearance of the acute shingles rash4.\n\nData from many countries indicate that older adults (aged 50 and over) are at highest risk for shingles as more than 90% of older adults have been infected with wild type VZV3. A person\'s risk for shingles increases sharply after 50 years of age3. Risk of complications, including PHN and hospitalisation, also increase with age3. The individual lifetime risk of developing shingles is approximately one in three for people in the USA; however, for individuals aged 85 and over, this risk increases to one in two people3,4.\n\nReferences\n\nCunningham et al., N Engl J Med 2016; 375: 1019-32.

The study, described in a NEJM article, involved 13,900 adults 70 or older from 18 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. The study results showed that the new vaccine reduced the likelihood of developing shingles by nearly 90% and decreased by nearly 89% the likelihood that those who did develop shingles despite the vaccine would experience the lingering, sometimes severe, pain that affects about one-in-five people who have shingles.
The release generally did a good job of quantifying the benefits and acknowledging side effects without using sensational language. It neglected to note that many financial ties exist between numerous researchers involved and GSK . In addition, the release didn’t mention that another vaccine (though less effective) is already in use or that the study excluded individuals with compromised immune systems, who are at the greatest risk of developing shingles.

Currently more than half of people who are treated even at early stages of the disease can expect the cancer to return, and chemotherapy typically leads to only a 5% improvement in people’s chances of living five years — but an up to 70% chance of being exposed to serious toxicities.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThe studies involve a group of immune-based cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to rip away the molecular cloak behind which cancer cells hide from the immune system. The medications target a protein called PD-1, its related PD-L1, or CTLA-4, which protect the body’s cells from being killed by immune cells; because tumors are normal cells growing out of control, they take advantage of this molecular security blanket to avoid getting detected by immune cells. A series of checkpoint inhibitor drugs, first approved in 2011 initially for treating melanoma, expose the tumor cells to the immune system. Based on their success in treating skin cancers, scientists are now studying this group of drugs in a number of other cancers, including tumors in the lung.\n\nIn one study, called CheckMate-227, researchers tested whether a combination of two of these checkpoint inhibitor drugs could keep tumors from growing better than the standard treatment of chemotherapy in people with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nearly 300 people were randomly assigned to receive either the combination of the immune-based drugs or the traditional chemotherapy treatment. After nearly a year, the lung cancer in people taking the immunotherapy was 42% less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy.\n\nWhat’s more, say the study’s authors, doctors may also figure out which people are most likely to respond to the two-drug combination of nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) and which are not. In the study, he and his colleagues found that people whose tumors had more mutations enjoyed the longest time period during which their cancers did not progress.\n\nCurrently, lung cancer treatments rely heavily on chemotherapy, but doctors are shifting toward a more customized and precise way of treating each person’s disease in order to improve their chances of survival. For example, newer targeted therapy drugs home in on specific genetic mutations that are responsible for driving a person’s cancer. Doctors can also determine if a person’s lung cancer is genetically vulnerable to the checkpoint inhibitor drugs tested in the current study. Putting together everything that doctors currently know about lung tumors, “more than half of people with lung cancer can avoid chemotherapy and get more precision-based treatments,” says Dr. Matthew Hellmann of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), lead author of the study. In addition, “a year after treatment, three times more people on immunotherapy were doing well compared to those who just got chemotherapy.”\n\nThe results could play a role in changing standard treatments for people diagnosed with advanced NSCLC, by making a strong case for starting people immediately on the immunotherapy combination rather than giving them chemotherapy first, as many doctors currently do. While nivolumab is approved for treating metastatic NSCLC, for example, that indication calls for using it if the disease continues to progress either during or after chemotherapy. This combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed that the paired drugs could be more effective when begun as the first treatment, instead of chemotherapy.\n\nGet The Brief.

In another study, researchers found that combining standard chemotherapy with another immune-based checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), helped them live nearly four months longer on average than people treated with just chemotherapy. People getting the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy were 51% less likely to die after 10.5 months than people receiving chemotherapy alone. “The magnitude of benefit was unexpected and great to see,” says Dr. Leena Gandhi, associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and co-author of the study. Pembrolizumab is already approved for treating about 25% to 30% of people with advanced NSCLC who have a certain genetic profile that makes their cancer vulnerable to the drug, but this latest study expands that population to many more people who may benefit from the immunotherapy if the medication is combined with chemotherapy.\n\nThe results are even more encouraging for people with early stage lung cancer. In a third, small study of 21 people diagnosed with early stage disease, researchers led by a team at Johns Hopkins and MSKCC found that giving people two doses of nivolumab before surgery to remove lung tumors shrunk those tumors drastically and lowered chances of relapse, thanks to its ability to jump start the immune system to fight the cancer. When the scientists analyzed the tumors they had cut out, they found that in about half of the people treated with nivolumab, the growths showed significant destruction by immune cells, meaning that nivolumab had unmasked the tumors as foreign and allowed the immune system’s killer cells to attack them. And when the scientists studied the blood of the people receiving the immunotherapy, they discovered a close match between the types of immune cells in the blood and certain targets on the tumor cells, suggesting that nivolumab had released the immune system to pump out the appropriate cells it needed to tackle the cancer.\n\n“We expected to see some response, but I don’t think we expected to see a 45% significant response,” says Forde. “To give you some idea of how significant that is, with chemotherapy we normally see the same degree of response around 20% of the time.”\n\nForde says that the strong response seen in people at the beginning of the disease could suggest that immunotherapies might be useful in re-training the immune system to fight cancer for long periods of time — possibly even a lifetime. “The Holy Grail is to have a relatively non-toxic therapy that could potentially use the body’s own immune system to prevent recurrence,” he says. “And while our study is only with 21 patients, the early indications from this study are very positive.”\n\nTaken together, the results could fundamentally change the way lung cancer is treated, significantly improving people’s ability to both hold off lung cancer for longer periods of time, as well as live longer with the disease.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]","When the stakes are this high, it’s critical that news stories give a clear picture of the proven benefits, limitations of the evidence, potential side effects, and costs.","This story is one of two we reviewed about studies of drugs that activate the immune system to fight lung cancer. The studies involving Keytruda, Yervoy and Opdivo — known as checkpoint inhibitors — were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting. We also reviewed the Washington Post’s coverage.
While this story didn’t rely on a news release, it fell short almost everywhere else. Most significantly, it didn’t help readers understand that one of the studies is expected to result in immediate changes to how one common type of lung cancer is treated. It also didn’t give data that would illustrate the scope of the benefits of these drug, study limitations, side effects or costs.

Neoptolemos, of the Cancer Research U.K. Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit at the University of Liverpool in England, and colleagues.\n\nThe study authors noted that, currently, the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is very poor, with a five-year survival rate of less than 5 percent. Surgery to remove cancerous tissue can boost the odds to as much as 10 percent, however, and there is active search underway to improve a patient\'s chances even more by adding in additional chemotherapy following surgery.\n\nThe pool of nearly 1,100 patients that the researchers focused on were part of the large European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer trial that took place across 159 pancreatic cancer centers located in Europe, Canada, Australasia and Japan.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the participants were divided into one of two six-month chemotherapy groups: one receiving fluorouracil and folinic acid post-surgery and the other receiving gemcitabine.\n\nAfter nearly three years of treatment, the researchers found almost no difference between survival rates in the two groups.\n\nThose who received fluorouracil and folinic acid chemotherapy had lived an average of 23 months. At the one- and two-year markers, survival rates for that group was approximately 78.5 and 48 percent, respectively.\n\nAt the three-year mark, patients on the gemcitabine regimen achieved an average survival rate of 23.6 months. One- and two-year survival rates were 80 and 49 percent, respectively, the investigators found.\n\n""In conclusion, gemcitabine did not result in improved overall survival compared with fluorouracil plus folinic acid in patients with [surgically removed] pancreatic cancer,"" the authors concluded in their report.\n\nHowever, the team did observe one appreciable difference: patients on gemcitabine were less likely to experience serious side effects as a result of their chemotherapy treatment than those on the fluorouracil/folinic acid treatment (7.5 percent versus 14 percent).\n\nDr. Michael Choti, a professor of surgery and oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, described the study as ""important,"" but he does not believe it will alter the current approach to post-surgical chemotherapy.\n\n""Really in the scope of things following major surgery, both are fairly tolerable regimens, and this study doesn\'t necessarily change the pattern of use in terms of choosing post-operative therapy,"" Choti said.\n\n""But the point is that pancreatic cancer is a terrible disease, and really just a minority of patients are candidates for surgery. And even for those, unfortunately 75 to 80 percent of those will go on to recur even after the surgery appears to be successful. So, indeed, there has been a strong interest in giving the best additional therapy possible,"" Choti added.\n\n""So this is not a revolutionary finding, but it\'s part of an effort to look at what we have and even to find newer regimens with more combinations of drugs,"" he noted. ""And that\'s exactly what\'s already underway, as we search for more aggressive and more successful treatments.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more information on pancreatic cancer.']","<font size=""3"">It takes trial and error to find appropriate cancer strategies. We are happy to see reporting on a strategy that failed because failures can ultimately lead to successes.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nThey found a series of 45 different compounds linked with metabolism that were different in the women destined to develop the condition, and said that could form the basis of a test.\n\nSuch a “metabolic fingerprint” test could save the lives of thousands of women, Philip Baker of the University of Alberta in Canada, who helped lead the study, said in a statement.\n\n“If we can bring the rates of maternal deaths in undeveloped countries down to the rates in developed countries, by being able to determine which women are at the greatest risk for developing pre-eclampsia, then it has that potential to save thousands of lives,” Baker said.\n\nThere is currently no test to predict which women will develop pre-eclampsia, which is marked by high blood pressure and high protein levels in urine.\n\nIf mothers and their babies survive, the women later have a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. The babies are usually born prematurely and suffer complications all their lives.\n\nThe cost of treating mothers with pre-eclampsia is $45 billion a year in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, the researchers said.\n\nIn undeveloped countries, 75,000 women die from pre-eclampsia each year.\n\nWriting in the journal Hypertension, the researchers said they did a simple study, testing the blood of 60 women who developed pre-eclampsia later in pregnancy and 60 women who did not. They ran the test at about 15 weeks gestation.\n\n“We identified 40 organic molecules to be significantly elevated and 5 that were reduced in plasma at 14 to 16 weeks’ gestation,” they wrote.\n\nFrom this series of compounds they narrowed down a list of 14 sugars, fats and amino acids that were different in the women who developed the condition.\n\nIt detected around 90 percent of the cases, with a false positive rate of about 24 percent, meaning 24 percent of the women flagged in the test as having a risk of pre-eclampsia would never actually develop it.\n\n“A high caliber predictive test would allow women who are identified at high-risk for pre-eclampsia to seek obstetric care by specialists and to be monitored more vigilantly,” Eleni Tsigas, executive director of the Pre-eclampsia Foundation, said in a statement.\n\n“It would also ensure that those women are educated about the warning signs of pre-eclampsia.

694,news_reviews_00445,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/news-release-review/strong-accounting-of-early-study-on-colorectal-cancer-drug-but-was-a-release-really-warranted/,2016-04-29 04:00:00,Experimental drug guadecitabine found safe in patients with colorectal cancer ,"['In a small, phase I clinical trial, Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center researchers say they show for the first time that the experimental drug guadecitabine (SGI-110) is safe in combination with the chemotherapy drug irinotecan and may overcome resistance to irinotecan in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Results of the study are expected to be presented April 17 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2016 in New Orleans (abstract CT017).\n\nGuadecitabine works to reverse a so-called epigenetic change in cancer cells known as methylation, which may alter genetic activity in cells in a way that can block the action of tumor-suppressing genes, pushing cells to become cancerous and resistant to therapy. By reversing this change in cancer cells, the drug restores cancer cells\' vulnerability to drugs such as irinotecan.\n\nThe clinical trial included 22 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had been treated previously with irinotecan and whose disease was progressing. The patients were divided into four groups, each receiving different doses of guadecitabine in combination with irinotecan, over an average period of four months.\n\nDuring the study, 15 patients had at least one imaging scan to retest the extent and location of their cancers -- with 12 patients experiencing stable disease -- for more than the four-month period, on average, and one patient experiencing a partial response to the treatment (measured as at least a 30 percent reduction in the size of the tumors.)\n\nAlthough the study\'s main purpose was to test the safety rather than the effectiveness of guadecitabine doses, ""we were very happy to see some patients who benefited from the combination of the therapies for many months to more than a year,"" says Nilofer Azad, M.D., professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nThe study also showed signs that guadecitabine reduced methylation among the cancer cells. ""We did see that giving a higher dose of the drug seemed to produce a better methylation response among patients,"" says Valerie Lee, M.D., a fellow at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. ""However, it seemed that patients were responding at all levels of the drug.""\n\nAmong the side effects of the combined treatment, 16 patients experienced neutropenia, a low count of the infection-fighting white blood cells called neutrophils; five patients with neutropenia had fevers; three patients became anemic; and two patients developed thrombocytopenia, a lowered count of blood-clotting platelets. Other side effects included diarrhea (three patients), fatigue (two patients) and dehydration (two patients). There was one death during the study, possibly resulting from febrile neutropenia caused by the treatment.\n\nThe current study was based on previous studies in the laboratory of Nita Ahuja, M.D., director of the Sarcoma and Peritoneal Surface Malignancy Program and professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which showed that guadecitabine limited the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines when combined with irinotecan, says Azad.\n\nThe drug combination is being tested in an ongoing phase II clinical trial (NCT01896856) in a larger group of metastatic colorectal cancer patients at multiple institutions to determine the effectiveness of the dual therapy compared with chemotherapy regimens that do not include guadecitabine, says Azad.\n\nScientists leading the new study will also look for biomarkers in patients that could help determine which of them are most likely to benefit from guadecitabine and irinotecan. Lee says the research team will measure the amount of methylation in patients\' cells when they begin their treatment and the presence of genes associated with irinotecan resistance, among other possible biomarkers.\n\nIn 2015, there were more than 130,000 people in the U.S. diagnosed with colon cancers. Five-year survival rates among people with localized colon cancers are more than 90 percent, but they are only 20 percent in those with metastatic cancer.\n\nGuadecitabine is an experimental drug that has not been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It is manufactured by Astex Pharmaceuticals, a supporter of the Johns Hopkins-led study. The research was also supported by the Van Andel Research Institute SU2C/AACR Epigenetics Dream Team.\n\nOther scientists who contributed to the research include Judy Wang, Anup Sharma, Zachary Kerner, Stephen Baylin, Ellen Lilly, and Thomas Brown from Johns Hopkins; Anthony El Khoueiry from the University of Southern California; Henk Verheul and Elske Gootjes from Vrije Universiteit in the Netherlands; and Peter Jones from the Van Andel Research Institute.\n\n###']",This news release portraying a safety trial of a drug for treating colorectal cancer uses a measured tone in explaining the very preliminary nature of the study.,"The news release discusses the findings of a small study that was designed to assess the safety of the experimental drug guadecitabine for use in conjunction with the conventional drug irinotecan to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. Phase 1 studies are designed to evaluate safety, observe side effects and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). As such, the toxicity profile would be expected to be rather high. The study found that guadecitabine did cause some adverse side effects. The most concerning being low white blood cell count (neutropenia) in 73% of the subjects.  One subject died from infection related to the low white blood cell count.  However, the study also reported that there were positive effects with some patients — although the release clearly notes that this study was not designed to assess beneficial outcomes. Calling the drug “safe” in the headline may be a bit of a stretch, but otherwise the release does a good job of explaining the study, describing the fact that the drug is in the earliest stages of clinical testing, potential harms, and the study’s ties to the company that manufactures guadecitabine.

But it puts a greater emphasis on age than the ACC and AHA did in determining who might benefit from the medication in preventing heart attack or stroke. It is also slightly more conservative when it comes to determining the benefits of taking the medications, which include Lipitor, Crestor and Zocor.\n\nThe new guidelines, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that people ages 40 to 75 who have one or more risk factors — such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or smoking that put them at a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years — should be on statins. The group also said that people with a 7.5 percent to 10 percent risk “may also benefit” but did not definitively recommend they take them. “People in this group should make an individual decision with their doctor about whether to start taking statins,” the task force advised.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn contrast, the ACC and AHA recommend that people with a 7.5 percent or greater risk take the drugs.\n\nAnother important difference between the groups is that the task force withheld a recommendation about starting statins in adults who are 76 and older, saying that “the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms.” In a commentary accompanying the recommendations, Philip Greenland and Robert Bonow note that there is “uncertainty and hesitation” in the guidelines regarding older people but said it appears that it is not necessary to stop taking statins at age 76 if you are already on them.\n\nAD\n\nThe task force and AHA groups carry tremendous influence in medical practice and in what insurance companies will cover. Medicare typically follows USPSTF guidelines in determining coverage and the Affordable Care Act specifies that USPSTF recommendations rated at the strongest levels must be used as a floor for coverage for private insurers. In the case of statins, this would apply to the use of the drug by those who are 40 to 75 years old with one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and who have a 10 percent or greater risk — but not those with 7.5 to 10 percent risk.\n\nIndividual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.\n\nThere is a consensus among experts that people at substantial risk for heart disease benefit from statins but considerable disagreement about those at lower risk. Last month, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote in the journal Lancet that “it’s a force for good.” But Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects — which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women — should be taken more seriously.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn an opinion piece Sunday, Redberg and Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, advised everyone to take “a step back” and ask “why this debate is so contentious.” They suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated, that the drugs as an intervention are “weak,” and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete.\n\n“In deciding on any therapy, it is important to understand the risks and benefits, particularly for healthy people,” they wrote.\n\nThe two U.S. guidelines are notably more aggressive in recommending drugs than reports issued by their counterparts in other parts of the world, including the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (which recommends statins in men 40 and older but only after age 50 in women, and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which recommends discussing lifestyle modification before offering statin therapy). The European Society of Cardiology focuses more on managing LDL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStatins are among the best-selling drugs in the United States, with a 2011 study showing at least 32 million Americans were taking them. The 2013 ACC and AHA guidelines recommend an estimated 24 million more people should be on them.\n\nThe task force’s recommendations come on the heels of an important new study, published Saturday, that shows that people who use statins survive heart attacks better than those who do not. They are more likely to not only get to the hospital and survive until they are discharged but also survive in greater numbers a year after their hospitalization than those who do not use statins.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD']","Despite an alarmist headline, this story on statin therapy is relatively thorough, with some notable exceptions.","
Despite an alarmist headline, this report of the USPSTF’s recommendations on statin therapy is relatively thorough, with some notable exceptions. The strength of the evidence underlying the recommendations is not discussed and the actual amount of potential benefit from statin therapy is not mentioned, nor is the potential for harm adequately elaborated upon.
Perhaps what is most missing from this “just-the-facts ma’am” article on the USPSTF’s recommendations is the larger sense of context: major statin trials have all been funded by statin manufacturers where we know that adverse event information is incomplete and sometimes hidden, benefits are typically exaggerated as they are expressed in relative risk reductions, and that most people, physicians and patients included, will likely overestimate the benefit they might derive from statin therapy.
Above all, the medicalizing of cholesterol levels in otherwise healthy people is considered by some to be among the biggest current scandals in medicine. Having said that, it was good to see this article tipping the hat toward those who have put forward very strong arguments against the measuring and altering of our blood cholesterols, mentioning the questionable chance of benefit and the many potential harms. It also was good to see that the article noted that there were at least two sides to this issue and that “Individual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.”

""The benefits of aspirin outweigh the harms for most people in their 50\'s who are at risk of cardiovascular disease but not at increased risk of bleeding. For people in this group, taking low-dose aspirin daily can help reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer.""\n\nAdults in their 60s can also benefit from regular use of low-dose aspirin, but the bleeding risk is higher in this age group, so doctors should help these patients decide whether or not aspirin therapy is right for them on a case-by-case basis.\n\n""The task force recommends that all patients talk to their doctor to evaluate their risk for cardiovascular disease and bleeding before making a decision about aspirin use, but this is particularly important for people in their 60s,"" Bibbins-Domingo said.\n\nHeart disease and colorectal cancer are among the most common causes of death in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 610,000 Americans die of heart disease each year, accounting for 1 in 4 deaths. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women (excluding skin cancers) and a leading cause of cancer death, the American Cancer Society reports.\n\nWhile taking low-dose aspirin daily can help prevent heart troubles, doctors note that it also increases the risk of bleeding in the stomach and intestines, and strokes caused by bleeding in the brain. The task force looked at the most up-to-date research on both the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of both heart disease and colorectal cancer to arrive at their recommendations.\n\nWhen it comes to dosing, experts say sticking to a low-dose baby aspirin is best.\n\n""The evidence shows that there\'s really no incremental benefit of going over 81 milligrams, and in fact, you may increase bleeding risk by going over,"" CBS News medical contributor Dr. Tara Narula, a cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told ""CBS This Morning"" when the draft guidelines were released last September.\n\nAt this time, the task force reports that more research is needed to assess whether taking aspirin is beneficial for people who are younger than 50 or those who are 70 and older.']","Several missed opportunities in this story, including a lack of hard data.","This is a short report on the recent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on the use of aspirin, one of two stories we reviewed on this topic.

The results were presented on May 22 at the annual conference of the Particle Therapy Cooperative Group, held in San Diego.\n\n""This evidence underscores the precision of proton therapy, and how it can really make a difference in cancer patients\' lives,"" said Dr. Chuong.\n\nPatients with esophageal cancer can suffer a range of side effects, including nausea, fatigue, lack of appetite, blood abnormalities and lung and heart problems. Proton therapy did not make a difference in all of these side effects, but had significant effects on several.\n\nThe results have particular relevance for the University of Maryland School of Medicine; this fall the school will open the Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC). The center will provide one of the newest and highly precise forms of radiation therapy available, pencil beam scanning (PBS), which targets tumors while significantly decreasing radiation doses to healthy tissue. This technique can precisely direct radiation to the most difficult-to-reach tumors.\n\nProton therapy is just one of several new methods for treating cancer. Others include:\n\nSelective Internal Radiation Therapy, a precision modality for treating patients with particularly difficult-to-remove tumors involving the liver such as those from colorectal cancers;\n\nGammapod, a new, high-precision, noninvasive method of treating early-stage breast cancer;\n\nThermal Therapies, the use of ""heat"" in treating a broad spectrum of malignancies.\n\nThe treatment works well for many kinds of tumors, including those found in the brain, esophagus, lung, head and neck, prostate, liver, spinal cord and gastrointestinal system. It is also an important option for children with cancer and is expected to become an important option for some types of breast cancer. While most cancer patients are well served with today\'s state-of-the-art radiation therapy technology, up to 30 percent are expected to have a greater benefit from the new form of targeted proton beam therapy.\n\nLocated at the University of Maryland BioPark, the 110,000 square-foot, $200 million center is expected to treat about 2,000 patients a year.\n\n###\n\nAbout the University of Maryland School of Medicine\n\nThe University of Maryland School of Medicine was chartered in 1807 and is the first public medical school in the United States and continues today as an innovative leader in accelerating innovation and discovery in medicine. The School of Medicine is the founding school of the University of Maryland and is an integral part of the 11-campus University System of Maryland. Located on the University of Maryland\'s Baltimore campus, the School of Medicine works closely with the University of Maryland Medical Center and Medical System to provide a research-intensive, academic and clinically based education. With 43 academic departments, centers and institutes and a faculty of more than 3,000 physicians and research scientists plus more than $400 million in extramural funding, the School is regarded as one of the leading biomedical research institutions in the U.S. with top-tier faculty and programs in cancer, brain science, surgery and transplantation, trauma and emergency medicine, vaccine development and human genomics, among other centers of excellence. The School is not only concerned with the health of the citizens of Maryland and the nation, but also has a global presence, with research and treatment facilities in more than 35 countries around the world.\n\nmedschool.umaryland.edu/']","Beyond the claim that proton therapy causes fewer side effects, this promotional-sounding release contains almost no useful information.","Treatment room at the Maryland Proton Treatment Center.
Proton therapy has been shown to be a significant improvement over other forms of radiation therapy for a select group of conditions including: intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs); ocular tumors, including intraocular/uveal melanoma; and skull-based tumors (e.g., chordomas or chondrosarcomas). Its value in other tumor types and conditions has not been demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial. The University of Maryland (UMD) release claims that proton therapy, also known as proton beam therapy, causes fewer toxic side effects when used to treat esophageal cancer patients. However, that’s about all we learn from this news release. The release doesn’t touch on many important questions, such as how many fewer side effects proton beam therapy causes, whether those side effects actually reduce health risk for patients, or whether proton therapy is more effective at treating the cancer. The release also doesn’t address cost or even describe the study that forms the basis for the claims.

She\'s a breast surgery fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston.\n\nHow to navigate differing breast cancer screening guidelines\n\nThe study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods, including breast MRI and genetic testing, Plichta said.\n\n""We believe formal risk assessment is essential for women ages 40 to 44 in order to identify those who require screening mammography to start at the age of 40, and those who would qualify for screening MRIs and genetic testing,"" Plichta said.\n\nPlichta was to present her team\'s findings Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons annual meeting in Dallas. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they\'ve been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Breast Surgeons.\n\nThe cancer society updated its guidelines in 2015, recommending that women could wait until age 45 to start receiving annual mammograms. Previously, the cancer society had recommended yearly screenings starting at age 40.\n\nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) subsequently changed its guidelines to mirror the new cancer society recommendation, Plichta said. However, she noted the ASBS added a few extra conditions:\n\nWomen should start mammograms earlier than 45 if they have a calculated lifetime risk greater than 15 percent.\n\nWomen with a 20 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer also should undergo screening MRIs.\n\nWomen with a 5 percent or greater risk of a breast cancer-related genetic mutation should receive genetic testing.\n\n""Critical to the development and interpretation of both of these new guidelines is formal risk assessment,"" Plichta said. ""Furthermore, risk assessment is needed not only to determine who qualifies for mammography, but also who may require screening MRIs and/or genetic testing.""\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations state that most women begin mammography at age 50. However, they also say that women should talk to their doctors about risk factors that could lead them to start breast cancer screening earlier.\n\nThe new study involved more than 900 women. None had been diagnosed with breast cancer. All were seen as new patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital breast clinic between March 2011 and October 2015, the researchers said.\n\nFifty percent of these women met either the ACS or the ASBS requirements for early mammography, Plichta said. That includes 39 percent who met the ACS criteria for above-average risk for breast cancer, and an additional 11 percent who met the American Society of Breast Surgeons\' criteria.\n\nThe researchers also found that 32 percent of the women met the groups\' eligibility standards for regular screening MRIs, and 25 percent would be eligible for genetic testing, Plichta said.\n\nBreast cancer risk assessments are typically not a part of standard care for this age group, the researchers noted. Since the new guidelines lean heavily on knowing breast cancer risk, doctors need to redouble their efforts to make sure risk assessments are done for women in their early 40s, they concluded.']","The story didn’t discuss the limitations of risk assessments, nor explain or define what “risk” really means.

The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV.\n\nA pivotal international clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. The findings indicate that if uninfected populations are vaccinated with Gardasil 9, approximately 90 per cent of all cervical cancers worldwide could be prevented.\n\nPublished in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study found that, among uninfected women, Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick of Queen Mary University of London, who co-authored the report and participated in the design and analysis of the study, and served on the Trial Advisory Board, comments: ""This is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\n\n""Gardasil 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent, nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women. However, it\'s crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus. Our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 12-13, as the current UK vaccine programme is doing, but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 25-45 as part of a screening appointment.""\n\nUntil late last year, there were two available vaccines to protect against HPV related disease (Cervarix and Gardasil). The UK currently uses Gardasil which protects against four HPV types and offers about 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer, and also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts.\n\nHowever, researchers have been trying to find methods to completely eliminate cervical cancer and other HPV related disease and by adding five more cancer related HPV types. The development of the new Gardasil 9 vaccine makes an important step in that direction.\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus. Many people infected with HPV clear it from their systems with no lasting health concerns and some types of the virus are low risk, causing warts or verrucas. However, other types are high risk, causing cervical cancer (and less commonly vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers). Almost all cases of cervical cancer occur as a result of infection with high risk types of HPV.\n\nCervical cancer is still the fourth most common cancer in women, with over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths per year worldwide. In the UK around 3,000 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer and in 2011 there were around 970 deaths.\n\nIn the UK, all girls aged 12 to 13 are offered HPV vaccination as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.\n\nProfessor Jack Cuzick concludes: ""Following these important findings, this vaccine has been licenced in the USA and approval is currently being sought in the UK and other countries. It is encouraging that the Joint committee on Vaccines and Immunisation is reviewing Gardasil 9 in light of this new evidence.""\n\nThis clinical trial was funded by Merck.\n\n###\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nCharli Scouller\n\nPR Manager (School of Medicine and Dentistry)\n\nQueen Mary University of London\n\nc.scouller@qmul.ac.uk\n\nTel: 020 7882 7943 Notes to the editor About Queen Mary University of London\n\nQueen Mary University of London (QMUL) is one of the UK\'s leading universities, and one of the largest institutions in the University of London, with 20,260 students from more than 150 countries.\n\nA member of the Russell Group, we work across the humanities and social sciences, medicine and dentistry, and science and engineering, with inspirational teaching directly informed by our research - in the most recent national assessment of the quality of research, we were placed ninth in the UK (REF 2014).\n\nWe also offer something no other university can: a stunning self-contained residential campus in London\'s East End.

It carefully describes an important study comparing two forms of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and provides the reader with information on the potential impact of HPV infections. However, it doesn’t deliver fully on several of our other criteria including costs, quantification of benefits, and harms.
We also think that it is important from a public health perspective to discuss use of the vaccine in the context of screening programs for cervical cancer (e.g. Pap tests). While the release does mention screening, it does so only in passing. The vaccine can  greatly reduce the risk that immunized girls will develop cervical cancer in the future, but it cannot totally eliminate that risk, even when all three doses are administered. In addition, the rates of complete vaccination among eligible girls is not ideal, and a few words about the importance of completion would have added to the release.

HER2 has been established as a therapeutic target in breast cancer, and breast cancers in which the HER2 gene is not amplified do not, in general, respond to HER2-directed therapeutic approaches.\n\nA few years ago, when the research teams of Dr. Matthew Ellis and others carried out a molecular characterization of breast cancer tumors, they found a new mutation in HER2 that was different from gene amplification but also resulted in tyrosine kinase being constantly activated.\n\n""In this particular activation mechanism, the cells develop a subtle mutation within the functional part of the HER2 gene that activates the enzyme,"" said Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, part of the National Cancer Institute-designated Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. ""The mutation locks the enzyme into an \'on\' position.""\n\nEllis and his colleagues developed a preclinical model to study this new HER2 mutation and discovered that the enhanced enzymatic activity could trigger tumor formation. Furthermore, these tumor cells were sensitive to an experimental drug, neratinib. With this information in hand, the researchers took the next step.\n\n""We launched a phase II clinical trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation,"" Ellis said. ""Finding patients that are positive for a HER2 mutation required a national collaboration because we had to screen hundreds of patients to identify the 2 to 3 percent that have a tumor driven by a HER2 mutation. The results of the clinical trial were encouraging in that about 30 percent of the 16 patients treated with neratinib had a meaningful clinical response showing significant disease stabilization or regression. Neratinib was well tolerated by most patients.""\n\n""This is the first time we had a reasonable number of patients treated for HER2 mutations in whom we could estimate the response rate.""\n\nThe number of patients who could potentially benefit from this new treatment approach is estimated to be in the thousands. The researchers estimate that as many as 200,000 patients are likely to be living with metastatic breast cancer today in the United States. Based on the estimate that the new mutation is present in 2 to 3 percent of cases, the researchers calculated that approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients with metastatic breast cancer carry a HER2 mutation and are therefore potential candidates for neratinib treatment.\n\nCirculating tumor DNA analysis, a promising diagnostic tool\n\nTo identify the patients in this study who carried the new HER2 mutation, the researchers required tissue from the tumor, a biopsy, from which they could extract and sequence the genetic material to determine the presence of the HER2 mutation. This task turned out to be a major challenge because for 20 to 30 percent of the patients the researchers did not have sufficient material to make the diagnosis.\n\n""To assist in our ability to identify patients with HER2 mutation-positive tumors, we conducted circulating tumor DNA analysis,"" Ellis said. ""The tumor\'s DNA is released into the human bloodstream, and we were able to determine the presence of the mutation in blood samples from the patients. Importantly the circulating tumor DNA results were highly concordant with the tumor sequencing results, and they were much easier to determine. Notably, the blood test was sensitive enough that we could use it as a tool to determine eligibility for the clinical trial.""\n\nIn addition to bringing to the table a novel treatment for metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation, the researchers have tested the value of the circulating tumor DNA as a disease-monitoring marker.\n\n""A circulating tumor DNA-based blood test also could therefore be potentially used to monitor tumor progression and to determine whether patients are responding or not to treatment after just one month of therapy,"" Ellis said.\n\nEllis also is a McNair Scholar at Baylor.\n\nRead all the details of this study, the full list of contributors and their financial support in Clinical Cancer Research.\n\n###']","It’s irresponsible to claim thousands could benefit based on results from a study of 16, where five had a response.","This news release describes the effects a new drug, neratinib, had on a very small subset of patients with metastatic HER2+ positive breast cancers. Neratinib (marketed as Nerlynx) very recently received FDA approval as an add-on treatment for early stage HER2+ positive cancer, but this information was left out of the release. In fact, the release refers to neratinib as an “experimental” drug. It was also confusing as to what was being highlighted in the release. The first part describes the results of a 16-patient clinical trial for which only five patients showed a “meaningful clinical response” (no details were given on what that meant), but the second part of the release describes a new screening tool used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial. It was concerning that the release didn’t talk about the limitations of the clinical trial results, disclose the lead authors’ numerous financial ties with the drug maker, discuss costs associated with the drug, or describe any side effects. In the end, despite its optimistic tone and claim of novelty, the release doesn’t provide much information on progress towards treating this type of cancer.

The test is administered like a tuberculin skin test (TST), and results are interpreted by measuring the size of the skin induration two or three days later.\n\nThe TST is the most commonly used test to detect TB infection, with about 50 million tests worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. The test is easy to administer but produces too many false positives to achieve the WHO\'s goal of reducing TB deaths by 95 percent and new cases by 90 percent by 2035, Dr. Ruhwald said.\n\nIntroduced a decade ago, IGRAs have high specificity, producing few false positives, but require blood samples and complicated lab work, which has limited their widespread use. There is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests. According to Dr. Ruhwald, a TST costs about $2; an IGRA is 20 to 40 times more expensive depending on setting.\n\nIn the first clinical trial, Dr. Ruhwald and colleagues conducted a double-blinded study of C-Tb in 979 participants enrolled at 13 clinical trial sites in Spain. Participants, all adults, ranged in TB status from presumed uninfected through intermediate and high risk of latent TB to active disease.\n\nResearchers found:\n\nBoth C-Tb and the IGRA had a specificity of 97 percent.\n\nC-Tb was highly concordant to IGRA in 95 percent of study participants.\n\nThe specificity of C-Tb, unlike the TST, was not impacted by the BCG vaccine, the partially effective vaccine that many residents in the developing world receive. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent.\n\nThe sensitivity of C-Tb was comparable to the IGRA in confirmed TB cases (77 percent vs. 81 percent), indicating similar abilities to detect infection.\n\nIn the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. The study, conducted in South Africa, enrolled 1,090 participants, including 299 patients with HIV and 402 children as young as 28 days.\n\nResearchers found:\n\nAmong participants with HIV, the ability of all three tests to detect TB infection was diminished, though the C-Tb appeared more robust in HIV-infected participants with low CD4 T cell counts.\n\nAmong children under 5, C-Tb was comparable with the other two tests in identifying those infected.\n\nDr. Ruhwald said another advantage of C-Tb is that the measurement of infection, a 5mm or larger induration, is universal across patients with different risk factors, including HIV infection. With TST, the size of the induration is often adjusted to increase its accuracy in measuring infection in different patient populations.\n\nRegulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA.\n\n###\n\nAbstract 9953\n\nDiagnostic Accuracy of the Novel C-Tb Skin Test for Latent M.tuberculosis Infection; Results from Two Phase III Clinical Trials\n\nM. Ruhwald1, J.A. Cayla2, H. Aggerbaek1, K. Dheda3, P. Andersen1\n\n1Statens Serum Institut - Copenhagen/DK, 2Public Health Agency of Barcelona - Barcelona/ES, 3UCT Lung Institute, Lung Infection & Immunity Unit - Cape Town/ZA\n\nRationale\n\nRenewed emphasis on the detection and preventive treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected individuals at risk is required to reach the goals of the WHO post-2015 global tuberculosis strategy.\n\nStatens Serum Institut has developed a novel specific skin test, C-Tb, based on the antigens ESAT-6 and CFP10. C-Tb combines the field friendliness of the PPD-based Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), with the high specificity of the interferon gamma release assays (IGRA).\n\nThis presentation outlines the results from two recently completed phase III trials (TESEC-05 and -06). The results have not previously been published or presented.\n\nMethods\n\nThe TESEC-06 trial included 979 participants from 13 clinical trial sites in Catalonia, Galicia and Basque Country (Spain) with various risk profiles of M.tuberculosis infection. The TESEC-05 trial included 1090 participants with symptoms of TB and 100 endemic controls from Cape Town (South Africa).\n\nIn both trials C-Tb and TST were administered in a double-blinded fashion to one or the other forearm. Skin indurations were read 2 to 3 days later. A reading ?5mm was considered positive for the TST and C-Tb (cut off preset in phase II). Blood for IGRA testing (Quantiferon, QFT-GIT) was drawn prior to skin testing.\n\nResults\n\nThe safety profile of C-Tb was acceptable and not different from TST. Test specificity was assessed in 212 presumed unexposed Spanish controls. Here, C-Tb had comparable specificity to QFT-GIT (both 97%, p=1.0, and there was no impact of BCG vaccination). By contrast, previous BCG vaccination subverted TST specificity [62% (67/108) in BCG vaccinated compared to 95% (99/104) in BCG unvaccinated persons; (p<0.001)]. Sensitivity of C-Tb and QFT-GIT was comparable in patients with confirmed TB [77% (235/307) vs 81% (250/307); p=0.08]. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). The impact of age and HIV infection on C-Tb, TST and QFT reactivity was assessed in 1090 individuals with symptoms suspect of TB disease, analysis is ongoing and will be included in the presentation.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThese phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons.\n\nThe field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.']",This release on a new skin test for tuberculosis provides a good overview of benefits and the study methods but we’d like to know who sponsored the study.,"This news release summarizes the results of two clinical trials gauging the efficacy of a new test for tuberculosis — C-Tb. The study compared the new test with a more complex, and expensive, alternative and measures whether the new test works better in patients who are HIV-positive and/or who are vaccinated with the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine. The release provides adequate data for readers to trust its claims but doesn’t mention funding sources or address whether there was any potential for conflicts of interest. To its credit, however, the release includes a basic research abstract providing more detailed information on the results from the trials.

But in their normal state, they are inactive and too few in number to have a measurable effect on cancer.\n\nPrevious laboratory research by Borrello and his colleagues showed that activated MILs could selectively target and kill myeloma cells taken from patients and grown in laboratory culture flasks.\n\nFor the clinical trial, the Johns Hopkins team enrolled 25 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma, although three of the patients relapsed before they could receive the MILs therapy.\n\nThe scientists retrieved MILs from each patient\'s bone marrow, grew them in the laboratory to expand their numbers, activated them with microscopic beads coated with immune activating antibodies and intravenously injected each of the 22 patients with their own cells. Three days before the injections of expanded MILs, patients received high doses of chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant, standard treatments for multiple myeloma.\n\nOne year after receiving the MILs therapy, 13 of the 22 patients had at least a partial response to the therapy, meaning that their cancers had shrunk by at least 50 percent.\n\nSeven patients experienced at least a 90 percent reduction in tumor cell volume and lived, on average, 25.1 months without cancer progression. The remaining 15 patients had an average of 11.8 progression-free months following MILs therapy. None of the participants had serious side effects from the MILs therapy. The overall survival was 31.5 months for those with less than 90 percent disease reduction, but this number has not yet been reached in those with better responses. The average follow-up time is currently more than six years.\n\nBorrello notes that several U.S. cancer centers have conducted similar experimental treatments, known as adoptive T cell therapy, but says the Johns Hopkins team is believed to be the only one to use MILs. Other types of tumor-infiltrating cells can be used, but they are usually less plentiful in patients\' tumors and may not grow as well outside the body, says Borrello.\n\nIn nonblood-based tumors, such as melanoma, only about one-half of patients have T cells in their tumors that can be harvested, and only about one-half of those harvested cells can be grown. ""Typically, immune cells from solid tumors, called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, can be harvested and grown in only about 25 percent of patients who could potentially be eligible for the therapy. But in our clinical trial, we were able to harvest and grow MILs from all 22 patients,"" says Kimberly Noonan, Ph.D., a research associate at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nNoonan says the small trial helped her and her colleagues learn more about which patients may benefit from MILs therapy. For example, they were able to determine how many of the MILs grown in the lab were specifically targeted to the patient\'s tumor and whether they continued to target the tumor after being infused.\n\nAdditionally, the scientists found that patients whose bone marrow before treatment contained a high number of certain immune cells, known as central memory cells, also had better response to MILs therapy. Patients who began treatment with signs of an overactive immune response did not respond as well.\n\nNoonan says the research team has used these data to guide two other ongoing MILs clinical trials. Those studies, she says, are trying to extend anti-tumor response and tumor specificity by combining the MILs transplant with a Johns Hopkins-developed cancer vaccine called GVAX and the myeloma drug lenalidomide, which stimulates T cell responses.\n\nThe researchers say the trials also have shed light on new ways to grow the MILs. ""In most of these trials, you see that the more cells you get, the better response you get in patients. Learning how to improve cell growth may therefore improve the therapy,"" says Noonan.\n\nKimmel Cancer Center scientists are also developing MILs to treat solid tumors such as lung, esophageal and gastric cancers, as well as the pediatric cancers neuroblastoma and Ewing\'s sarcoma.\n\nExperts report there are more than 20,000 new cases of multiple myeloma and more than 10,000 deaths each year in United States. It is the second most common cancer originating in the blood.\n\n###\n\nOther Johns Hopkins scientists who contributed to the research include Carol Ann Huff, Janice Davis, M. Victor Lemas, Susan Fiorino, Jeffrey Bitzan, Anna Ferguson, Amy Emerling, Leo Luznik, William Matsui, Jonathan Powell, Ephraim Fuchs, Gary L. Rosner, C. Epstein, Lakshmi Rudraraju, Richard F.

These are both easier to retrieve and easier to grow in the lab, two factors that reduce the complexity of this treatment approach.
The release is in many ways a model for other organizations reporting on similar studies. The description of the study is clear, the language used appropriately conservative, and there is context regarding the novelty of the approach and current alternative treatments. Some discussion of possible costs — preliminary though it would have to be — would have completed the picture for readers. Rather than hyping such a study in a frenzied attempt to attract clicks and eyeballs, Hopkins presents the findings in a thoughtful way that reflects well on the institution’s reputation and will help build that reputation over the long haul.

Not So Much,"['A study believed to be the largest of its kind suggests that the physical aspects of yoga are effective at relieving low back pain, but it didn\'t find any evidence that yoga provided broader mental benefits.\n\nThe study, funded by the National Institutes of Health\'s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, was published online Monday in the Archives of Internal Medicine. It was lead by researchers at Seattle\'s Group Health Research Institute.\n\nA study believed to be the largest of its kind suggests that the physical aspects of yoga are effective at relieving low back pain, but didn\'t find any evidence yoga provided broader mental benefits. Jennifer Corbett-Dooren explains on Lunch Break.\n\nSmaller studies in the past have suggested that yoga, which involves stretching exercises along with a mental component of deep breathing and other relaxation techniques, was moderately effective at easing symptoms of chronic lower back pain.\n\nIt was thought the combination of stretching and relaxation relieved back pain, according to previous studies.\n\nBut the current study found both yoga and stretching were equally as effective, suggesting the benefits of yoga are attributable to the physical benefits of stretching and not to its mental components, said the study\'s lead author, Karen J. Sherman, senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute.\n\nIt involved 228 adults with chronic, low back pain that didn\'t have a specific cause such as a spinal disc problem. They were divided into three groups to compare two types of classes with patients using a self-care book that provided instruction on exercises and stretches to help treat lower pain.\n\nThe people who took classes may have been more likely to complete the exercises. More than 80% of the participants in the self-care group reported reading some of the book and doing some exercises, but time spent on the exercises was typically less than the class groups. ""They need that class format to get started,"" Ms. Sherman said.\n\nAbout 50% of patients in the yoga or stretching classes reported feeling much better or completely better in relation to their back pain and function compared to about 20% of patients in the self-care group, said Ms. Sherman.\n\nTwice as many patients in the yoga and stretching groups reported decreased medication use during the study compared to the self-care group.\n\nAbout 90 patients each were randomly assigned to attend 75-minute weekly yoga classes or weekly stretching classes for 12 weeks. The people who attended the classes were also instructed to practice for 20 minutes a day at home in between classes.\n\nAnother group involved 45 patients who were given a 200-page book with advice on exercising, lifestyle modifications and managing flare-ups.\n\nThe type of yoga used in the study was viniyoga, a style of hatha yoga, that adapts exercises for each person\'s physical condition. The stretching classes involved 15 stretches targeting the lower back and legs were which held for a full minute repeated for a total of 52 minutes of stretching.\n\nThe study measured changes in back pain and functional status at the beginning of the study and at six weeks, 12 weeks and six months.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Corbett-Dooren at jennifer.corbett@dowjones.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Is the benefit of yoga for chronic back pain more physical than mental? This story led with this point in its headline and opening paragraph—and thereby got off on the wrong foot.</span>","




It is an interesting point to explore, since the study authors mentioned it as well. But the journalist could have dug a little deeper and noticed the study was never designed to prove this point—and didn’t. So the Wall St. Journal led with a mischaracterization of the study results.
The study found that yoga and intensive stretching exercises were equally effective in relieving pain and enhancing function—and that both were superior to a self-care educational booklet in the management of chronic back pain at the primary study endpoint of 12 weeks.
“Finding similar effects for both approaches suggests that yoga’s benefits were largely attributable to the physical benefits of stretching and not to its mental component,” the authors wrote in the discussion section.
But this is just an opinion. And it is just as possible that both group interventions—yoga and intensive stretching—had physical and mental benefits in the management of low back pain. A recent article in the Lancet pointed out that the causes of low back pain are generally obscure, as are the mechanisms of pain relief. (See Balagué et al., 2011)
The Wall St. Journal article offered a brief but useful description of the study, its background, and context. But as with a New York Times article on the same topic, there was a hole in the coverage. The journalist included the views of the study authors but offered no perspectives from independent experts.
The study had an important limitation that should have at least been mentioned. The researchers studied relatively affluent subjects with mild, uncomplicated back pain that did not result in substantial functional problems.
So the results may not apply to the individuals who bear the heaviest burden from chronic back pain and related disability: those on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder, those with medicolegal dilemmas in the workplace, and those with other more complicated mental and physical health problems.
The study also did not compare yoga to the “usual treatments” for low back pain offered in the U.S. medical system. So yoga’s overall benefits may not be quite as clear as the Wall St. Journal article suggests.

After trying other treatments, he is currently taking immunotherapy infusions of the drug Keytruda in a final effort to fight the disease. Cohen has an incurable cancer called mesothelioma and is advocating for the right to choose how and when he will die.\n\nJohn Moore / Getty Images, file']",This news story shows how you can capture the excitement in the scientific community around a new treatment while still providing important context.,"Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter on stage during the 2008 Democratic National Convention.
This is a story about a lung cancer clinical trial for a drug known as Keytruda. As the story explains, Keytruda “worked at least as well if not better than the chemo, so the researchers have stopped the study to give everyone a chance to take” it.
The thorny issue here is that the drug company involved, Merck, issued a a detail-free announcement about the results, putting reporters in a tough position because they had no details about the study, but were expected to explain the importance of the findings.
Given this shortcoming, this NBC News story did many things right and packed a lot of information in, just as it did with its previous report on the same drug and its effect on melanoma.
We would have liked to have seen at least one voice of caution in the piece, as so many of the quotes seemed a little over-the-top given what we know right now about the findings. And the story should have made clear that until we have information on actual patient response rates, we don’t really know how much this will change lung cancer treatment.
Overall, though, this shows how you can capture the excitement in the scientific community around a new treatment while still providing important context. (We do want to note that the original headline, shown above, has since been edited by NBC to “Keytruda, the drug that helped Jimmy Carter, also protects against lung cancer.” That’s misleading, since it suggests that the drug prevents cancer when it’s established use is cancer treatment.)

The lower dose seemed more effective than the higher one. Those who received placebos got worse.\n\nA third also had scans to assess their brains’ use of glucose. One hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease is reduced metabolism in the brain, which shows up on scans as less use of glucose, the fuel for brain cells. In this assessment, those getting insulin used more glucose in their brains; those taking placebos used less.\n\nFor years, the study’s principal investigator, Suzanne Craft, has studied insulin’s effects in Alzheimer’s. She is professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington in Seattle and director of the memory disorders clinic at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System.\n\nBrain cells need insulin, Dr. Craft said.

The problem was to find a way to get more insulin to the brain but not to the body.\n\nThe solution was a special device made by Kurve Technology that delivers a spray of insulin deep into the nose. From there the hormone travels along the path of nerves into the brain.\n\nThe investigators first tried a single dose of insulin delivered via nasal spray to the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease.

It is too soon to say if the treatment is even safe, she said. And patients would need a special device to get it deep into the nose.

The most commonly recommended sideline test is the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, a multipart examination during which athletes are asked to name the date, describe how they feel, memorize and recall lists of words, and do jumping jacks and other tests of coordination. Ideally, this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional.\n\nBut while the sidelines of college and professional games are crowded with doctors and certified athletic trainers, few high schools and youth leagues have those resources. Most of the time, concussion testing in youth sports falls to volunteer coaches or parents with little if any medical experience.\n\nThat situation prompted researchers at New York University’s Langone Concussion Center to begin wondering recently whether there might be other, easier diagnostic tools to check young players for concussions.\n\nTheir thoughts soon turned to vision.\n\n“About 50 percent of the brain’s pathways are tied in some to way to vision and visual processing,” said Dr. Steven Galetta, chairman of neurology at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center and senior author of the study, which was published in The Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology.\n\nEye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone’s brain is working.\n\nBut for the most part, visual tests have not been part of the standard protocol for sideline concussion testing of young athletes.\n\nHowever, the N.Y.U. researchers knew that in recent years, trainers working with athletes in sports such as boxing and mixed martial arts, where concussions are common, had begun supplementing the Standardized Assessment with a simple vision exam, known as the King-Devick test, during which someone reads slightly jumbled lines of numbers printed on three cards as quickly as possible. (See below for more information.) The King-Devick test measures rapid eye movement, visual tracking and related cognitive responses and is a reliable indicator of cognitive problems. If an injured adult reads the numbers more slowly after a head impact than in baseline testing, he or she is considered to have sustained a concussion.\n\nThe test requires no medical training.\n\nBut it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes. So the N.Y.U. researchers decided to test it.\n\nThey recruited 243 young hockey and lacrosse players between the ages of 5 and 18, and 89 collegians from the same sports.\n\nThese athletes all completed a baseline Standardized Assessment of Concussion exam during preseason and walked as fast as possible along a narrow 10-foot long strip of athletic tape to measure their balance. They also completed the King-Devick test.\n\nThen they went out to play.\n\nDuring their subsequent competitive seasons, 12 athletes hit their heads and were put through the full battery of sideline concussion tests by parents or coaches, under the supervision of N.Y.U. medical personnel. Fourteen age-matched uninjured athletes in the same sports completed the same tests, to serve as controls.\n\nNeurologists later confirmed that the 12 injured athletes had sustained concussions.\n\nThen the N.Y.U. researchers compared how well the various sidelines tests had done at pinpointing the brain injury.\n\nThe Standardized Assessment of Concussion had performed rather miserably, correctly identifying only two of the concussed athletes, missing 10, and finding that three of the uninjured control athletes had supposedly sustained a concussion, since their scores had declined compared with their baseline (almost certainly, the study’s authors believe, because these young athletes were physically tired).\n\nThe King-Devick test did much better, correctly assessing concussion in 75 percent of the young injured players and inaccurately identifying it in only one.\n\nThe pace-along-the-tape test was also relatively accurate. Ten of the 12 injured athletes were slower now, but so were five of the unhurt players.\n\nOverall, the King-Devick test had by far the greatest accuracy and lowest risk of false positives.\n\nThe upshot, Dr. Galetta believes, is that parents and coaches “should absolutely consider” familiarizing themselves with the King-Devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts, then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines.\n\nIf an athlete hits his or her head and is then slower than baseline by even a fraction of a second at reading off the numbers, Dr. Galetta said, it is very probable he or she has a concussion and needs to be taken from play and seen by a doctor.\n\nIt is still too early to say, however, whether the King-Devick test can replace other, more conventional concussion evaluations for young athletes, including the standardized assessment, despite its shortcomings in this study, Dr. Galetta cautioned. For now, he says, it probably should be used in conjunction with other tests.\n\nHow to Administer the King-Devick Concussion Test\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring preseason, use a stopwatch to time the athlete as he or she reads off the numbers on each line from left to right as quickly as possible. The cards should be read in order. This establishes a baseline time. For the greatest precision, you might want to have athletes perform the test twice and use their best reading.\n\nDuring the season, if an athlete is suspected of sustaining a concussion, have him or her repeat the test on the sidelines. If the time is slower, even by a small amount, he or she probably has a concussion, according to neurologists.\n\nInterestingly, uninjured athletes are almost always faster at reading the numbers during games or practices, because physical exertion sharpens the kind of visual performance being tested.\n\n\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, “like” our Facebook page.']","This is an interesting, readable account of a new study on a hot topic. But identifying concussions with this new test isn’t quite as simple as the story suggests.","This story describes an alternative test for concussion that can be administered by parents and volunteer coaches at minimal cost. The omission of any mention of the potential weaknesses of the test is a glaring one. Speaking with an expert who was not associated with the study likely would have shed light on important limitations of the research. Diagnosing and treating concussion in youth sports remains a controversial topic among concussion experts.

I\'m a healthy person. I don\'t want to put anything unnecessary inside my body.\' ""\n\nSo DiPasqua, like many women, tried other things, for four years: ""I tried black cohosh, I tried soybeans; I would eat edamame by the handful,"" says the Richmond, Va., college marketing specialist. She limited caffeine and alcohol and jogged daily.\n\nThe result: She kept on overheating, about a dozen times a day and two or three times a night. She says her makeup melted, her clothes were ruined, her sheets soaked — and she got just plain tired.\n\nA few months ago, she went back to her doctor and got a prescription for a hormone patch. She doesn\'t love it, she says, but it works.\n\nWhat doesn\'t work for hot flashes: Among remedies that have failed repeated scientific tests:\n\n\n\nSoy products: Soy contains a plant estrogen. And Japanese women, who eat a lot of it, have fewer hot flashes. But the most recent disappointing study, published in August in the Archives of Internal Medicine, found that women who took soy supplements actually had more hot flashes than those who did not.\n\n\n\nFlaxseed:: Researchers at the Mayo Clinic created some excitement in 2007 when they reported that flaxseed, which also contains plant estrogen, helped reduce hot flashes in a small study. A few months ago, they reported on a larger follow-up study. Bottom line: it didn’t work and caused bloating, diarrhea and nausea.\n\n\n\nBlack cohosh and red clover: These herbs worked no better than placebos in a year-long study published in Menopause in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiPasqua\'s experiences are right in line with the latest research: Despite high hopes and years of study, most alternative treatments for hot flashes just don\'t work. Hormones do, but many women still see them as a last resort. A few other prescription drugs show mild promise.\n\nHot flash FAQ: What are they? Sudden sensations of heat, often accompanied by sweating and skin reddening and sometimes palpitations.\n\n\n\nWhat triggers them? Falling estrogen levels set the stage. But day to day triggers can include sudden changes in room temperature, hot drinks, stress, alcohol and caffeine.\n\n\n\nWho has them? More than half of U.S. women in the menopausal transition (usually mid-40s to mid-50s). Obese women and smokers are at increased risk.\n\n\n\nHow long does one hot flash last? 30 seconds to 1 hour. Average time: 3 to 4 minutes.\n\n\n\nFor how many years can a woman have hot flashes? In some cases, 20 years or more. Half have flashes for at least four years.\n\n\n\nHow bothersome are they? For 20% to 25% of women, the physical discomfort and embarrassment have a significant, negative impact on quality of life.\n\n\n\nSources: International Menopause Society , Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation at www.swanstudy.org\n\nSo the great, universally accepted hot flash cure remains elusive.\n\nSearching for alternatives\n\n""It\'s not a very optimistic picture,"" says Robert Freedman, a professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University, Detroit. He contributed to a treatment review published recently in the journal Climacteric by the International Menopause Society.\n\nThe report is bluntly dismissive of non-prescription remedies, saying: ""Substantial funding from the National Institutes of Health and other non-pharmaceutical sources has failed to show any benefit of over-the-counter therapies compared to placebo for (hot flashes), and the safety of these compounds is not confirmed.""\n\nThe comparison to placebos is key, because even sham treatments reduce reported hot flashes, at least temporarily, by about 50%, says Michelle Warren, medical director of the women\'s health center at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York. So it\'s no wonder many women believe over-the-counter potions are effective, she says. ""But when they are tested rigorously against placebos, they don\'t work.""\n\nStudies continue. For example, some researchers are looking at equol, derived from soy, which might help some women, says Margery Gass, executive director of the North American Menopause Society and a consultant at the Cleveland Clinic Center for Specialized Women\'s Health.\n\n""It\'s always good to have research on other options,"" she says.\n\nMeanwhile, doctors still recommend exercise — it improves mood and has many other health benefits — but studies have failed to show it relieves hot flashes. In fact, aerobic exercise can trigger them, Freedman says. Yoga might be better. ""Paced respiration,"" the slow, measured abdominal breathing used in yoga, clearly helps some women, Freedman says.\n\nAnd it never hurts to keep your house cool, your clothes layered and a fan handy.\n\nEstrogen often is a last resort\n\nBut when those things don\'t work, and when women are miserable (not everyone is), most doctors will offer a prescription.\n\nIt could be for one of several non-hormonal drugs, including some antidepressants, which modestly reduce hot flashes. But the first choice — except for women with a history of breast cancer or other health conflicts — is still hormone therapy (estrogen, often combined with progestin).\n\nIt reduces hot flashes by about 90% and ""it\'s actually very safe, but that\'s not getting across to the public,"" Warren says.\n\nStudies since 2002, when a big study linked the hormones with breast cancer, have ""given us a lot of reassurance"" that risks are low for women who use them for a short time around menopause, Gass says.\n\nHormones still are not for every woman, but for DiPasqua, the benefits are clear. She\'s already stepped down from a dose that stopped all of her hot flashes but made her feel bloated. She feels better on a lower dose and is happy ""just simmering, instead of boiling over all the time,"" she says.\n\nThe best part, she says, is that she\'s not thinking about hot flashes much at all. Instead, she says, she\'s thinking about her next life passage — becoming a grandmother sometime in the next few days.']","Our reviewers, including a leading women’s health clinician-researcher, felt this piece would have been benefited from more data and context.","Since the story employed helpful sidebars, we yearned for a sidebar that provided some actual data on the tradeoff in HRT benefits and harms.
And we would have liked to learn more about the International Menopause Society:  who’s in it and do they have any conflicts of interest?

He is a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nRoughly 250,000 such infections occur in hospitals each year in the United States, costing about $250 million, the researchers pointed out.\n\nAlthough about 20 percent of hospitalized patients get a urinary catheter, one-third of the time they aren\'t needed, Saint said. He believes that patients can play a role in reducing catheter use.\n\n""A lot of patients and families don\'t realize that there are problems with a urinary catheter, so they may request them because they think it will allow patients to stay in bed,"" Saint said.\n\n""Unfortunately, there are side effects with a catheter. And I\'ve seen patients who have gotten up in the middle of the night and they trip and fall on the tubing,"" he explained.\n\n""Patients and families should request that a catheter not be put in, and if there is one there, the patient should ask every day whether it is still needed,"" Saint suggested.\n\nFor the study, Saint and his colleagues tried the new program in 600 hospitals.\n\nAfter 18 months of using the program, infection rates among hospital patients in general wards dropped by one-third, while catheter use had dropped about 1 percent.\n\nBut there was no drop in infections or catheter use in intensive care units (ICUs), the study findings showed.\n\nHospital-acquired urinary tract infection rates rose nationwide during the same time period, Saint noted.\n\nThe program Saint helped develop -- called the ""bladder bundle"" -- includes protocols, checklists, training and information-sharing that help doctors and nurses reduce catheter use and prevent infections.\n\nIncluded in the program are:\n\nDaily checks to see if a catheter is still needed.\n\nUsing other options to collect urine, such as bedpans.\n\nTraining for managing urinary catheters.\n\nUse of infection-control techniques for catheter placement and maintenance.\n\nFeedback to the medical team about catheter use and infection rates.\n\nThe researchers found that catheter infection rates in the new program dropped 14 percent overall in general wards (non-ICU).\n\nThe findings were published June 2 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDr. Susan Huang, a professor of infectious disease at the University of California, Irvine, wrote an editorial accompanying the study. She said, ""While we\'ve known the correct care processes for managing urinary catheters, we haven\'t been able to reliably reduce catheter-related infections.""\n\nAn intervention that focuses on changing the culture in hospitals to make them more responsive to the problem of infection control -- one that involves ""rallying around a focused problem and ensuring team-based solutions -- is integral to improving infection control in hospitals,"" she said.\n\nAs for improving infection control in intensive care units, Huang said, ""further analysis may help us understand why this intervention didn\'t work.""\n\n""This program can reduce urinary infections in hospitals if a team is assembled to ensure adoption of best practices and to rapidly correct reasons for failing to comply with these processes,"" she added.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on urinary tract infections.']","The story nicely breaks down the research team’s effort to attack catheter-caused UTIs with a program called “Stop CAUTI.” However, the discussion of the findings needed more succinct details on actual benefits seen when using the program.","HealthDay highlights a national effort to help reduce an uncomfortable and costly problem: hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), and specifically those caused by indwelling catheters. These devices are tubes that snake up the urethra into a person’s bladder, are anchored there with an inflatable balloon, and continuously drain a patient’s urine.
HealthDay nicely captures the scope of the problem, noting that one in five hospital patients are catheterized, and that, of these, 20% are bound to get a UTI. Looking at a typical year, this adds up to about 250,000 hospital-acquired UTIs and roughly $250 million in healthcare costs.
The story included quotes from Dr. Sanjay Saint, the lead author of the new study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The story breaks down his team’s effort to attack catheter-caused UTIs with a program called “Stop CAUTI,” which is a government-sponsored training toolkit to not only reduce indwelling catheterization rates, but also help caretakers use better technique when they have to insert the devices.
The results, as HealthDay explains them? It’s not clear; we’re not given many quantified benefits or study details, and the results that are included happen to conflict with each other. Also missing was a discussion around limitations of the research.

In contrast, the historical OS rate with standard of care concurrent chemotherapy and traditional radiation was 16 months at the time when the study was designed.\n\nThe findings are the final results of the single institution, Phase II study and represent the longest follow-up to date of stage 3 lung cancer patients who have received proton therapy, said Joe Y. Chang, M.D., professor, Radiation Oncology and the study\'s corresponding author.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 222,500 people will be diagnosed and 155,870 will die from the disease in 2017, with the majority of patients still being diagnosed when the disease is in an advanced stage.\n\n""Advanced lung cancer patients with inoperable disease traditionally have been treated with concurrent chemotherapy and conventional photon radiation therapy. However, the therapy can be very difficult for patients due to associated toxicities and because many patients are also dealing with comorbidities,"" explained Chang.\n\nProton therapy is an advanced type of radiation treatment that uses a beam of protons to deliver radiation directly to the tumor, destroying cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. Protons enter the body with a low radiation dose and stop at the tumor, matching its shape and volume or depth. They deposit the bulk of their cancer-fighting energy right at the tumor, thereby reducing the dose to cardiopulmonary structures, which impacts the toxicity, functional status, quality of life and even survival for patients, explained Chang.\n\n""With our study, we hypothesized that proton therapy would offer a survival benefit to patients and reduce treatment-associated toxicities, which can be very serious,"" he said.\n\nThe study opened at MD Anderson in 2006; in this research, Chang and his colleague report on the study\'s five-year results.\n\nFor the prospective Phase II trial, 64 patients with inoperable, Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer were enrolled. The study\'s primary endpoint was OS. The researchers hypothesized that the median OS would increase from historical data of 16 months on standard therapy to 24 months. Secondary endpoints included distant metastasis and local and regional recurrence rates. Toxic effects of treatment in both the acute and late settings also were analyzed.\n\nMedian follow up was 27.3 months for all patients, and 79.6 months for alive patients. At five years, the median OS was 26.5 months, and the corresponding five-year OS was 29 percent. Median progression-free survival was 12.9 months, with a five-year progression-free survival of 22 percent.\n\nIn sum, 39 patients experienced a relapse, with distant sites representing 62 percent of all recurrences. Local and regional recurrence rates were low, 16 percent and 14 percent, respectively.\n\nAmong the acute and late toxic effects diagnosed in patients were: esophagitis, pneumonitis and cardiac arrhythmia. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care.\n\nChang noted his study is not without limitations. Of greatest significance: the study was designed more than a decade ago. While the study\'s survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved.\n\n""When the study opened, PET imaging had just been approved for lung cancer staging. The image quality was poor and didn\'t include a CT component in most facilities across the country,"" said Chang. ""Obviously, the technology has improved dramatically over the last decade and has made a significant impact on diagnosis and staging. Also, delivery of both the conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy (IMPT), have improved, thereby reducing side effects for both treatment modalities.""\n\nFor example, MD Anderson proton therapy patients with advanced lung cancer now can receive IMPT. The technique uses an intricate network of magnets to aim a narrow proton beam at a tumor and ""paint"" the radiation dose onto it layer by layer. Healthy tissue surrounding the tumor is spared, and side effects are even more reduced than earlier proton delivery, said Chang.\n\nA Phase II trial studying IMPT and concurrent chemotherapy is underway.\n\nChang also noted the advancements in cancer biology and immunotherapy and that both are important areas of research focus in combination with proton therapy.\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Chang, other authors on the all-MD Anderson study include: Stephen Hahn, M.D., Ritsuko Komaki, M.D., Pamela K.

That was the conclusion of a new study published today in the journal Molecular Therapy Oncolytics by scientists from The Gene Editing Institute of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care Health System.\n\nThe study reports that in both tissue culture and in a mouse, tumor growth stopped and there was a dramatic decrease in the volume of existing tumors when chemotherapy was combined with CRIPSP-Cas9, which was used to disable a tumor gene known as NRF2. Previous studies have shown that the NRF2 gene controls cell functions in lung cancer tumors that helps them thwart the effect of chemotherapies that might otherwise reduce or eliminate them entirely.\n\n""Our goal is to see if CRISPR can be used with chemotherapy to provide a safe, affordable way to give patients who are not responding to treatment at least a fighting chance against this very challenging cancer,"" said Eric Kmiec, Ph.D., the principal author of the study and the director of the Gene Editing Institute. ""We believe that finding ways to use CRISPR to improve existing treatments will lead to some of the first benefits for patients while we tackle the vital ethical issues around the use of CRISPR for edits that can be passed on through DNA. This is an exciting step in the journey of exploring the health benefits of gene editing.""\n\nThe study was led by Pawel Bialk, research scientist at the Gene Editing Institute, the nation\'s only CRISPR-focused research initiative situated in a community health care system.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Dr. Kmiec said there are chemotherapies that have helped patients achieve remission or at least live longer and enjoy a better quality of life by significantly slowing the progress of the disease. But he said some patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer, are resistant to chemotherapy agents used to treat the disease or develop resistance after being exposed to the drugs.\n\nDeveloping CRISPR in a Community Health Center: A Patient-Focused Approach\n\nDr. Kmiec said the lung cancer work reflects an approach adopted by the Gene Editing Institute to move cautiously in developing medical applications of gene editing. Based inside the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care, his research team gains unique insight into the lives and needs of cancer patients and the health care professionals who care for them, which helps them to maintain a strong focus on doing what\'s right for patients.\n\nDr. Kmiec noted that while his team is working to move into human trials, the CRISPR application being developed for lung cancer does not involve directly editing a patient\'s genome --only the genes in the tumor.\n\nCRISPR stands for ""clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats."" It was originally a defense mechanism found in bacteria that allows the bacteria to recognize and slice up the DNA of invading viruses. Scientists have learned how to manipulate this mechanism so that it essentially can be programmed to find and remove a specific sequence of DNA code--which acts like software for controlling biological activity in a cell. Cas9 is a reference to an enzyme, sometimes described as a form of ""molecular scissors,"" that is used by CRISPR to cut out a section of DNA code.\n\nResearch Aimed at Real-World, Affordable Solutions\n\nDr. Kmiec said there are many efforts under way to modify CRISPR so that it can be used to not only remove or ""knock out"" a section DNA, but also to replace or ""knock in"" a new strand of code. But he said there continues to be significant safety concerns around this type of CRISPR application. He said for now, his team is focused on ""using CRISPR in its native form, which is to just cut out a section of DNA,"" and to start with applications that do not directly impact the patient\'s DNA. He said using CRISPR to do things like improving drug response represents the ""low-hanging fruit"" of CRISPR patient applications.\n\n""We think it\'s best to start with CRISPR therapies that involve relatively conservative uses of this powerful tool,"" Dr. Kmiec said. ""This approach can also hopefully help contain costs and provide a level of safety and reliability that is reassuring for patients and increases the chance that insurance companies will provide coverage.""\n\nDr. Kmiec said that as a CRISPR research program that treats patients from across the economic spectrum, his scientists are keenly aware of the challenges of making cutting edge medical treatments accessible and beneficial for all patients.\n\n""This work is another significant step on the pathway to FDA approval,"" said Nicholas J. Petrelli, M.D., FACS, Bank of America endowed medical director of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute. ""The Gene Editing Institute is taking a careful and methodical approach to developing innovative therapies. Dr. Kmiec and his team interact with our oncologists who deal with lung cancer every day on how gene editing could have a realistic impact and improve treatment.

""To see the lives of our participants change so dramatically and so quickly was so exciting, and suggests great promise for the future of this new type of treatment.""\n\nAbout 70 percent of postmenopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms -— the familiar hot flashes -- which, in some cases, last for years. This new drug, labeled MLE4901 for research, is being tested in clinical trials and offers hope for curtailing postmenopausal symptoms.\n\nThe previous ""go to"" therapy was supplemental estrogen, which proved to have side effects like blood clots or even breast cancer.\n\nMLE4901 is taken orally and works by blocking one brain chemical called neurokinin B from binding to its receptor. The interaction between these two has been linked to the regulation of temperature in the brain when someone is deficient in estrogen—like in menopause.\n\n""We were able to identify this new therapeutic use for the compound -- which had previously been sitting on the shelf unused -- and within three years show this type of drug may make a tangible difference to the lives of millions of women,"" Professor Waljit Dhillo, an NIHR Research Professor from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London said.\n\nPrevious studies showed that giving women an extra amount of the brain chemical neurokinin B resulted in hot flashes -- and genetic differences between people could be the reason why some have more of the chemical, or more severe postmenopausal symptoms, than others.\n\nThis small study done at the Imperial College of London involved 37 women between the ages of 40 and 62 years who did not have a period for at least 12 months, the definition of menopause, and who suffered at least seven hot flashes per day. The groups received either MLE4901 twice a day for 4 weeks, or a placebo pill on the same schedule. Two weeks later the groups swapped their treatments.\n\nAt the end of the study, those who took MLE4901 had the frequency of their hot flashes reduced by 72 percent and the severity of hot flashes decreased by 38 percent. This improvement started as early as three days after first taking the drug and relief continued for the whole month of treatment.\n\n""We already knew this compound could be a game-changer for menopausal women, and get rid of three-quarters of their hot flushes in four weeks,"" Dhillo added. ""But this new analysis confirms the beneficial effect is obtained very quickly -- within just three days.""\n\nSleep and concentration improved after three days, too, which was an added bonus. The researchers noted that those improvements could have been related to the reduction in hot flashes.\n\nAll this is promising, but more research is needed and possibly a variation in the drug. A previous study on MLE4901 was associated with liver toxicity in a few participants, which resolved when they stopped taking it. They hope slightly modifying the drug may improve that side effect.\n\nLarger studies on MLE4901 are underway in the U.S. and U.K. that will help gain an understanding of the drug’s safety and effectiveness. Like any new drug, safety and effectiveness have to be proven to the FDA before the drug can be offered in the U.S.\n\nNajibah Rehman, MD, MPH, is a third-year Preventive Medicine Resident at the University of Michigan, working in the ABC News Medical Unit.']",News stories shouldn’t stir up excitement about therapies that haven’t been proven both safe and effective.,"This story covers an analysis of a small study about a potential drug to treat hot flashes associated with menopause, called MLE4901.

And so the current message is to replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, and in so doing, consume a moderate-fat diet, not too much, and also not too little,” Kris-Etherton told NBC News.\n\nKris-Etherton and colleagues did an intensive study with 45 typical Americans – all overweight or obese, but with healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.\n\nIt’s tough to test diets in real life, because people eat so many different things, but the team controlled what everyone ate, feeding them carefully calibrated diets. One was a lower-fat diet without avocado, another was a moderate-fat diet without avocado, and the third added one avocado per day to the moderate-fat diet.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service\n\nThe two moderate-fat diets looked a lot like the average American diet, with about a third of calories coming from fat. The lower fat diet provided 24 percent of calories from fat.\n\nEveryone spent five weeks on each diet. No one lost weight, but their low-density lipoprotein (LDL or “bad” cholesterol) levels changed.\n\n“All diets decreased LDL cholesterol, the main lipid risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But the diet with the avocado decreased LDL cholesterol the most,” Kris-Etherton said.\n\nAmericans are advised to keep total cholesterol below 200 and preferably below 180. LDL should be below 100.\n\nWhile they were eating the avocado-a-day diet, the volunteers saw their LDL go down by more than 13 points compared to their usual levels, Kris-Etherton’s team reported in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nLDL was 8.3 points lower on the moderate-fat diet without the avocado and 7.4 points less on the lower-fat diet.\n\nThe volunteers all ate Hass avocados, which have bumpy green skin. The Hass Avocado Board helped pay for the research, which was also funded by the U.S. government.\n\nIn addition to monounsaturated fats, the avocados contain fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols – all of which can help lower cholesterol. Avocados also contain natural sugars that may help regulate blood sugar.\n\n“We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats,” Kris-Etherton said.\n\n“All the foods were exactly the same, except the avocado versus oils that were high in monounsaturated fat on the moderate-fat diet. So that was the only difference between the two diets, which then tells us that it's the avocado that has additional benefits which are beyond the unsaturated fat.”\n\nThe findings are similar to a batch of studies that showed people who were given olive oil and nuts and told to add them to their diets ended up healthier. They were less likely to have strokes or heart attacks, and they were less likely to die over a period of years than people who didn’t get the extra oils.\n\nSaturated fat – the kind found in meat and butter – has a different chemical structure from the unsaturated fats found in plant products. Repeated studies have shown it raises the risk of heart disease.\n\n\n\n“We studied avocados but maybe a lot of other fruits and vegetables have these bioactive components which have additional cholesterol-lowering effects,” Kris-Etherton said. “And certainly there's an emerging research base showing that some of these bioactive components may affect another lipoprotein particle favorably, like high-density lipoprotein. I think we need to stay tuned for that. “\n\nAmericans may not be used to eating avocado but Kris-Etherton says it’s easy to add.\n\n“Consumers can include avocados in their diet in salads. They can include avocados on top of a sandwich, or in a sandwich. They can make guacamole and use vegetables rather than chips as the dip,” she said.\n\n“I love guacamole and with my recipe, I'll use avocados, cilantro, lime juice and garlic... and then sometimes I'll put salsa in, or red pepper flakes.”\n\nBut like anything, too much of a good thing can be harmful. Avocados are definitely not low-calorie food.\n\n“One avocado has around 200 to 250 calories. So I would strongly urge people not to just add an avocado a day to their diet but they have to substitute nutrient-poor calories, which are so popular in the U.S. diet.,” Kris-Etherton said.\n\nErika Edwards contributed to this story""]", ,"The story reports that a small study of overweight adults found that avocado consumption can lead to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels. Thanks in part to extensive comments gleaned from one of the researchers in an interview (something lacking from some competing coverage that was based on a press release), the story does a good job of placing the findings in context and showing how LDL cholesterol is tied to human health. Notably, it was the only story we reviewed that explained what’s considered a healthy level of LDL cholesterol.
If we had to pick one way we’d like to see this story improved, it would be to explain how the changes observed in the study translate to overall cardiovascular risk. In other words, what does a 13-point drop in LDL mean for someone’s risk of a heart attack or stroke?

819,story_reviews_01233,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3561/,2011-01-22 16:54:18,Coconuts are busting out all over,"['Images of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi often portray her carrying a coconut.\n\nThe symbolism has meant something to East Indians for thousands of years. And, increasingly, it resonates for Westerners.\n\nMove over, pomegranate and acai berry. Coconuts are the new “in” food, touted by natural-foods enthusiasts and chased by entrepreneurs looking for a big payday.\n\n“It’s a good time to own a coconut farm, that’s for sure,” said Daniel Fabricant, vice president for government and scientific affairs at the Natural Products Association, a trade association in Washington.\n\nFabricant said companies that belong to his organization, representing natural-foods retailers and manufacturers, are increasingly offering coconut-based products.\n\n“You’ve got fiber, fats and oils, water-based compounds, and you’ve got the milk,” he said. “It’s a holistic approach.”\n\nThe fruit’s appeal rests, in part, on this versatility. A single coconut produces water, nectar, flesh, milk and even textile fiber. That translates into a broad slate of products. And in contrast to another natural substance that gets transformed into a wide variety of products — petroleum — coconuts are viewed as healthy.\n\nBut are they?\n\nIt depends.\n\nCoconut water comes from young, green coconuts and contains a winning combination of electrolytes, sodium and potassium.\n\nIt is very healthy.\n\n“It’s an effective drink for rehydration that doesn’t bring in the added sugars and the additives,” said Dani Little, dietitian for the Whole Foods Market on Pearl Street in Boulder. “A lot of rehydrating beverages have additives, whereas the coconut water — it’s super clean.”\n\nCoconut oil and milk, though, are receiving mixed reviews.\n\nThe facts on fats\n\nCoconut fat is saturated, like the fat in lard and butter. The healthiest fats, those found in olive and canola oils, contain more monounsaturated fats, which do not raise LDL cholesterol and might even help lower it. Doctors and dietitians have warned people away from cholesterol-boosting saturated fats for years. Coconut fats are not an exception.\n\n“I’ve had clients who have added coconut oil to shakes and things like that, and their cholesterol has gone up significantly,” said Jessica Crandall, a Denver dietitian who is president of the Colorado Dietetic Association. “Saturated fat clogs your arteries and is not good for heart health. I was meeting with a cardiologist recently, and he said he doesn’t advise (coconut oil) for any clients.”\n\nThe fat issue is complicated by the types of fatty acids found in coconut, versus other saturated fats. While most other saturated fats contain “long- chain” fatty acids, most coconut fats are “medium-chain.”\n\nThis is advantageous for coconuts because the medium-chain fatty acids are broken down more rapidly by enzymes, said Little. In general, she said, fats high in medium-chain fatty acids are more healthy than those laden with long-chain acids.\n\nIn addition, coconut fats are high in lauric acid, which many believe acts as an antimicrobial, helping prevent viruses, fungi and parasites.\n\nEven so, Little, a coconut enthusiast, doesn’t recommend loading up on coconut fats. Instead of buying oils or supplements, just use the whole coconut.\n\n“What we tend to do with our food supply is take the positive and squeeze it into a pill or jar and think that will take care of everything,” she said. “If you focus on coconut oil, you lose out on the fiber and you are focusing on a concentrated source of calories. It’s the whole coconut that needs to be talked about.”\n\nThe coconut gold rush\n\nEntrepreneurs are talking about the whole coconut these days. Some — those toiling to make money with coconut water — are worried about the coconut supply.\n\nCoconut water “is much different from Red Bull or Vitamin Water,” said John Craven, the founder of Bevnet.com, a trade publication for the beverage industry. “If they want to make more, they just build more factories.”\n\nCraven describes the race to turn coconut water into a big market, like iced tea or energy drinks, as something akin to a gold rush.\n\n“Right now, coconut water is all the rage,” he said. “With the natural movement being in the forefront right now, the timing is right. In the past couple of years a couple of brands have figured out the right angle — electrolytes and hydration.”\n\nCraven estimated the coconut-water market at about $100 million annually right now, but companies are doubling their sales year after year. By next year, he said, one company alone — Vita Coco — could do $100 million or more in sales. He predicted within a few years it will be a billion-dollar market.\n\nMammoth beverage companies like Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and PepsiCo have investments in coconut water. Grocers shelves add new coconut-water products regularly.\n\n“Demand has increased exponentially, primarily in mainstream groceries like Walmart and Costco,” said Arthur Gallego, a spokesman for the New York-based Vita Coco. “It’s trickling down to the mass market.”\n\nThe company is growing so quickly, he said, it had to hunt for coconuts from outside of Brazil, where it previously harvested most of its fruit. Now it also gets coconuts from Asia.\n\n“The volume is going through the roof,” said Laura Sauls, a spokeswoman for Hermosa Beach, Calif.-based Zico. “We are seeing new competitors by the week.”\n\nIt’s not just the pure water that is exciting marketers. It’s increasingly being used as an additive, too.\n\nCoconut water “is very healthy, and that’s our aim,” said Kevin Conrad, a sales executive with GoFast, a Denver energy drink that now includes a version containing coconut-water concentrate.\n\nIt’s healthy — and simple, too. That’s one of the attractions, said Tom Rich, who is in charge of grocery operations for Whole Foods Rocky Mountain region.\n\n“It’s something you don’t have to figure out,” he said. “People know what it is and where it grows. It’s simple all the way around.”\n\nDouglas Brown: 303-954-1395 or djbrown@denverpost.com\n\nCoconut by the numbers\n\nOne tablespoon of coconut oil contains 120 calories and 14 grams of fat, 12.5 grams of which is saturated. A tablespoon of butter, by comparison, contains 102 calories and 11.5 grams of fat; 7.3 of those grams are saturated.\n\nCoconut milk doesn’t pack quite the wallop of oil, but consume it in moderation: a quarter-cup has 240 calories and 14.5 grams of fat, with 12.5 grams of the fat saturated.\n\nOne cup of coconut water contains 46 calories, a half-gram of fat , 252 milligrams of sodium and 8.9 grams of carbohydrates.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Marketing and true science slosh around in this story like a mug full of coconut milk.</span>","This story seems to want to be many things.

You know; no pain, no gain.\n\nWell, maybe not. New research from BYU exercise science professors finds that pro-inflammatory molecules actually go down in the knee joint after running.\n\nIn other words, it appears running can reduce joint inflammation.\n\n""It flies in the face of intuition,"" said study coauthor Matt Seeley, associate professor of exercise science at BYU. ""This idea that long-distance running is bad for your knees might be a myth.""\n\nIn a study recently published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology, Seeley and a group of BYU colleagues, as well as Dr. Eric Robinson from Intermountain Healthcare, measured inflammation markers in the knee joint fluid of several healthy men and women aged 18-35, both before and after running.\n\nThe researchers found that the specific markers they were looking for in the extracted synovial fluid--two cytokines named GM-CSF and IL-15--decreased in concentration in the subjects after 30 minutes of running. When the same fluids were extracted before and after a non-running condition, the inflammation markers stayed at similar levels.\n\n""What we now know is that for young, healthy individuals, exercise creates an anti-inflammatory environment that may be beneficial in terms of long-term joint health,"" said study lead author Robert Hyldahl, BYU assistant professor of exercise science.\n\nHyldahl said the study results indicate running is chondroprotective, which means exercise may help delay the onset of joint degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis.\n\nThis is potentially great news, since osteoarthritis--the painful disease where cartilage at the end of bones wears down and gradually worsens over time--affects about 27 million people in the United States.\n\n""This study does not indicate that distance runners are any more likely to get osteoarthritis than any other person,"" Seeley said. ""Instead, this study suggests exercise can be a type of medicine.""\n\nResearchers, which included then undergraduate (and now grad student) Alyssa Evans and PhD student Sunku Kwon, now plan to turn their attention to study subjects with previous knee injuries. Specifically, they\'re looking to do similar tests on people who have suffered ACL injuries.\n\nBYU professors Sarah Ridge and Ty Hopkins were also coauthors on the study.\n\n###']","The release is vague about benefits, the evidence and limitations of the research, most significantly that results from such a small number of volunteers are not statistically significant.","This news release suggests that long distance running may be protective of knee cartilage because the amounts of two biomarkers for synovial fluid inflammation decreased after 30 minutes of running. The volunteers in the study were all under 35 and healthy. Similar subjects tested without running showed no decrease in the two markers.
The release does a poor job of conveying the findings and will leave readers with the impression that this research is much more definitive than it really is. Here are a few of the shortcomings:

One patient with ovarian cancer had a complete response that lasted 89 weeks, one patient with gastroesophageal cancer had a partial response that lasted 16 weeks, and four patients (two with colon cancer, one with prostate cancer, and one with ovarian cancer) had stable disease.\n\n""Immunotherapy marshals the exquisite specificity of the immune system to destroy cancer, and some types may have potentially fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy,"" said Jay A. Berzofsky, MD, PhD, chief of the Vaccine Branch at the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. ""We are using a vaccine approach to generate an immune response to HER2, which is found at high levels on and drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, colorectal, and gastroesophageal cancers.\n\n""Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine for HER2-overexpressing cancers,"" continued Berzofsky. ""We hope that one day the vaccine will provide a new treatment option for patients with these cancers.""\n\nThe patients\' vaccines are individually customized by Berzofsky and colleagues using their own immune cells isolated from their blood. The blood-derived immune cells are modified in several ways in the laboratory. The final product, which is administered intradermally (between the layers of the skin), comprises patient-derived dendritic cells genetically modified with an adenovirus to produce parts of the HER2 protein.\n\nPreclinical studies, which were previously published in the AACR journal Cancer Research, showed that this type of vaccine could eradicate large, established tumors as well as lung metastases in mice.\n\nIn the dose escalation portion of the phase I clinical trial, patients were injected with the vaccine on weeks 0, 4, 8, 16, and 24 after enrollment in the study. Among the six patients who received the lowest dose of the vaccine, 5 million dendritic cells per injection, no clinical benefit was seen. Among the 11 patients who received either 10 million or 20 million dendritic cells per injection, six had clinical benefit.\n\nAdverse reactions were predominantly injection-site reactions that did not require treatment. No cardiotoxicity was seen.\n\n""Based on the current safety and clinical benefit data, the dose of the vaccine was increased to 40 million dendritic cells per injection and the trial opened to patients who have previously been treated with a HER2-targeted therapeutic, including patients with breast cancer,"" said Berzofsky.\n\n""Moving forward, we would like to investigate whether we can increase the proportion of people who benefit from treatment with the vaccine by combining it with checkpoint inhibitor therapy,"" he added.\n\nAccording to Berzofsky, the main scientific limitation of the study is that it is a relatively small, phase I clinical trial with no placebo control. However, the approach is sufficiently promising to warrant additional trials.\n\n###\n\nThis study was supported by intramural funds from the National Cancer Institute. Berzofsky declares no conflicts of interest.']",This release would have been better had it highlighted the study limitations early on.,"This release describes a phase 1 safety trial using a modified vaccine that researchers said showed a clinical benefit in some patients diagnosed with metastatic HER2 positive cancers. None of the 11 patients in the trial had previously been treated with standard therapies. The study was presented at a recent medical conference on immunotherapy.
The release makes projections about the “promise” of the study results although phase 1 trials are fundamentally designed to assess safety and toxicity from different dosages.

When patients suffer from a heart attack or other cardiac event, it\'s critical that they get appropriate care and adopt lifestyle changes to prevent future damage.\n\nParticipating in a cardiac rehabilitation program has been proven to be particularly effective in helping patients recover and stay healthy. Research indicates that CR improves five-year mortality rates by 25 to 46 percent for patients following a heart attack or other cardiac event. In fact, CR has been given a Class 1A recommendation by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, making it a critical component of the standard of care.\n\nIn recent years, Intensive cardiac rehabilitation programs have been created as enhanced alternatives to ordinary CR. Patients and their physicians choose ICR programs over CR for at least three reasons: they are backed by published clinical evidence supporting their efficacy; they offer more complete education and exercise to improve patients\' health; and they achieve greater patient adherence to the prescribed course of care.\n\nICR Programs Have Documented Results\n\nMedicare covers both CR and ICR, but only ICR programs are required to meet specific efficacy standards. Each Medicare-approved ICR program must demonstrate through peer-reviewed published research that it has a positive impact on cardiac outcomes, such as decreasing the need for bypass surgery or stenting, and reduces specific risk factors for cardiovascular disease. One of the Medicare-approved programs, Pritikin ICR, is based on a lifestyle change program that has more than 100 peer-reviewed studies validating its effectiveness, including significantly reducing levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, body mass index and blood pressure, as well as reducing risk factors for diabetes, breast cancer, prostate cancer and other comorbidities. R. James Barnard, Ph.D., a researcher at the University of California–Los Angeles and a co-author of many of these studies, says, ""These studies have consistently shown the value of a more comprehensive approach to health – combining exercise with proper nutrition and a healthy mindset – at preventing, controlling or reversing common diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension, and have proven the long-term sustainability of these lifestyle changes."" When physicians refer their cardiac patients to an ICR program, they can have confidence knowing that the program has been proven to be effective.\n\nICR Offers More In-Depth Education on Lifestyle Change\n\nIn practice, ordinary CR is undertaken in a series of up to 36 individual sessions, and patients typically spend most of that time on exercise rather than education and counseling to modify cardiac risk factors. In contrast, Medicare covers 72 sessions of ICR, allowing patients to supplement the exercise portion of ordinary CR with an in-depth education about the relationship between lifestyle and cardiovascular health. Each day of ICR includes both an exercise class and at least one class with practical lessons on how to make better nutrition choices, manage stress, stop smoking or maintain a positive attitude. This type of education is crucial for many patients to recover from a cardiovascular event and optimize their health going forward.\n\nDr. Albert Krause, cardiac rehab medical director at CHRISTUS Health in Shreveport-Bossier, Louisiana, said that ICR ""allows hospitals to provide cardiac patients with a comprehensive education about critical lifestyle changes following a heart attack or other cardiac event. It is an essential component of our continuum of care, complementing the surgical and medical treatments we offer, to improve patients\' long-term outcomes.""\n\nICR Achieves Better Patient Engagement\n\nICR programs also have improved patient engagement compared to ordinary CR. A study recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that only 62 percent of eligible cardiac patients are referred by their physician to a CR program, and only one-third of those patients actually attend the program. These patients attend an average of 20 to 24 sessions of ordinary CR, despite being prescribed up to 36 sessions. In comparison, a review of a sample of hospitals that recently implemented ICR programs all experienced a significantly higher level of patient adherence to the prescribed course of rehabilitation. Most of these hospitals averaged over 48 sessions per patient in the second half of 2015 – over double the industry average for ordinary CR.\n\nAs Dr. John Harvey, president and medical director of Oklahoma Heart Hospital, says: Patients report high levels of satisfaction with ICR and feel encouraged to stick with the program and adopt a heart healthy lifestyle.""']","This cardiologist-penned piece on intensive cardiac rehabilitation lacks hard numbers, cost information, and an exploration of the quality of the evidence being presented.","This is a cardiologist-penned article on the benefits of intensive cardiac rehabilitation (ICR) versus “ordinary” cardiac rehabilitation (CR). While it doesn’t seem to be a standard reported news story, it was published in the health section of U.S. News & World Report, placing it within our purview.
At first glance, this story appears to be hyper specific. A sample sentence: “Most of these hospitals averaged over 48 sessions per patient in the second half of 2015–over double the industry average for ordinary CR.”
This sentence is emblematic of the piece overall, because it does not reveal anything about the actual impact of intensive cardiac rehabilitation on health outcomes. Nor does it provide any information about the quality of the research being cited.

They reported this screening approach detected high-risk HPV in all of the cases of women who were found to have high-grade, abnormal cervical precancerous growths, showing that self-collection at home for HPV may be a viable method to identify women at high-risk for cervical cancer.\n\n""This is a demonstration that mailing self-collection kits and returning them to test for high-risk HPV infection has big potential to increase screening access among under-screened women, and to do that successfully,"" said UNC Lineberger\'s Jennifer S. Smith, the study\'s senior author, and a professor in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\nAlthough cervical cancer is preventable through early detection and treatment, the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 4,100 women will die from cervical cancer in the United States this year. Nearly 20 percent of women in the United States who are eligible for cervical cancer screening report they haven\'t been tested for cervical cancer within the recommended time interval, national surveys have shown.\n\n""Women are dying unnecessarily of cervical cancer because they either haven\'t been vaccinated against HPV in adolescence, or they\'ve not been getting screened according to national guidelines,"" Smith said. ""Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance.""\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration signed off on using an HPV test alone to screen for cervical cancer for women 25 years and older, in conjunction with the Pap test. Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave an ""A"" rating to HPV primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65.\n\n""There are a lot of different barriers that cause women to be underscreened,"" said the study\'s first author Andrea Des Marais, MPH, project manager with the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. ""HPV tests are being widely used now in the United States, but only through physician collection in clinical practice, which requires that women come to a clinic. Offering HPV testing using self-collection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened: those who don\'t access regular medical care.""\n\nFor the study, researchers mailed at-home, self-collection kits to low-income women in North Carolina who were overdue for screening by national guidelines. They included women between the ages of 30 and 64 years who had reported no history of receiving a Pap test, which checks for precancerous or cancerous cells, within the past four years.\n\nResearchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina. The brush samples were then tested in a lab for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections. Participants also self-collected samples at a clinic and handed them to a nurse, and had a pelvic exam for a clinician to collect a Pap smear sample.\n\nThe researchers compared the results from self- and clinician-samples - which were tested for high-risk HPV strains that are linked to cervical cancer - to the Pap results and the results of cervical biopsies collected during colposcopy, which is a secondary diagnostic test that confirms the presence of cervical pre-cancerous lesions among women with abnormal Pap smear results.\n\nThe home self-collection test indicated that 12.4 percent of women were infected with high-risk HPV, the self-collection tests used in the clinic found 15.5 of the women had high-risk HPV infection, and the clinician-collected test identified 11.4 percent of the women had high-risk HPV infection.\n\n""We found comparable detection between self-collection and physician-collection,"" Des Marais said.\n\nAll women found to have high-grade cervical lesions by Pap smear or by cervical biopsy were positive for high-risk HPV on their home self-collected sample.\n\n""We found in this sample, all of the women who had high-grade lesions had HPV-positive home self-collection results,"" Smith said.

But experts said the results are promising, and should prompt further studies.\n\n""We just wanted to see if this is feasible, and this study shows that it is,"" said lead researcher Dr. Mark Cook, of the University of Melbourne and St. Vincent\'s Hospital in Australia.\n\nThe prospect of being able to predict seizures is ""very exciting,"" he said, in part because it\'s the uncertainty of the disorder that can dim people\'s quality of life.\n\nIf people know a seizure is coming, Cook said, they can avoid driving or swimming that day, for example. They might also be able to adjust their medication use.\n\nEpilepsy is a neurological disorder in which the brain\'s normal electrical activity is temporarily disrupted, leading to a seizure. Seizures can be obvious, causing unconsciousness or convulsions, but often they trigger subtler changes in a person\'s perceptions or behavior -- like a short staring spell, confusion or an altered sense of taste or smell.\n\nEpilepsy is usually managed with medication, but for 30 percent to 40 percent of people with the condition, drugs don\'t keep seizures at bay. The new study included 15 people who were having at least two to 12 ""disabling"" seizures a month that were resistant to drug therapy.\n\nCook\'s team implanted each patient with the experimental device, which consists of electrodes placed between the skull and the brain, plus wires that run to a unit implanted under the skin of the chest.\n\nThat unit wirelessly sends data to a hand-held device that flashes a red warning light if there is a ""high likelihood"" of an impending seizure. (A white light signals a ""moderate"" likelihood, while a blue light means the odds are low.)\n\nFor the first four months, the devices collected data on patients\' seizures without actually flashing warnings. For 11 of the 15 patients, the implants seemed capable of correctly predicting a high risk of seizure at least 65 percent of the time. Those patients went on to the next four-month phase, where the devices were activated to give warnings.\n\nOver those four months, the implants worked fairly well for eight patients -- correctly giving the high-risk warning anywhere from 56 percent to 100 percent of the time.\n\nThere are plenty of questions left, said Dr. Ashesh Mehta, director of epilepsy surgery at the North Shore-LIJ Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center in Great Neck, N.Y.\n\n""This study is an important first step,"" said Mehta, who was not involved in the research. ""The next step would be to implant these in a larger sample of patients. And you need to see which groups of patients might be good candidates for this.""\n\nMehta said someone who has seizures only once in a while might not get enough benefit to outweigh the downsides of false alarms, for example. And someone who has many seizures each month might get little added information from the warning system, he said.\n\nIt may be the people who fall in the middle -- who have disabling seizures at unpredictable intervals -- who would stand to benefit the most, he said.\n\nBut any benefits need to be weighed against the risks. Besides false alarms and unnecessary anxiety, the implant itself can cause problems. In this study, three patients had serious complications, including one with an infection and one whose chest device moved and caused her pain. Two patients ultimately had the implants removed.\n\nStill, Mehta agreed that the technology could prove helpful to some people with epilepsy. If they know a seizure is coming, they might take an extra dose of their medication, for example.\n\nAn implanted device like this could also give patients and their doctors more information about their epilepsy, he added. In this study, the implants revealed that most patients were suffering more seizures than they thought; one patient who reported 11 a month was actually having more than 100.\n\nIn real life, Mehta said, it can be hard to know if you\'re feeling bad because of side effects from epilepsy medication or because you\'re having a lot of seizures. A device like this could help sort that out.\n\nBut what\'s still needed is evidence that this device does improve the quality of patients\' lives, Mehta said.\n\nThe study was funded by NeuroVista, the Seattle-based company developing the technology. Several of Cook\'s co-researchers work for the company.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about epilepsy from the Epilepsy Foundation.']","Overall, a fairly thorough report that addressed almost all of our criteria satisfactorily.","We appreciate how the story placed appropriate caveats up high in the first and second sentences of the story, and followed that with cautious language from both the author (“We just wanted to see if this is feasible…”) and an independent expert.

For older adults trying to slim down, pumping iron might be the way to go.\n\nA new study by researchers at Wake Forest University suggests combining weight training with a low-calorie diet preserves much needed lean muscle mass that can be lost through aerobic workouts.\n\nThe findings, ""Effect of Exercise Type During Intentional Weight Loss on Body Composition in Older Adults with Obesity,"" appear in the November issue of the journal Obesity.\n\n""A lot of older adults will walk as their exercise of choice,"" said Kristen Beavers, assistant professor of health and exercise science at Wake Forest and lead author of the study. ""But this research shows that if you\'re worried about losing muscle, weight training can be the better option.""\n\nIn this 18-month study of 249 adults in their 60s who were overweight or obese, restricting calories plus resistance training in the form of weight-machine workouts resulted in less muscle loss, but significant fat loss, when compared to weight loss plus walking or weight loss alone.\n\nLosing weight is generally recommended for those with obesity, but preserving muscle - while losing fat - is particularly important for older adults in order to maximize functional benefit, Beavers said.\n\n""Surprisingly, we found that cardio workouts may actually cause older adults with obesity to lose more lean mass than dieting alone.""\n\nLoss of lean mass could have important consequences given the high risk of physical disability among the growing population of older adults.\n\nThe findings:\n\n+ Total fat loss was much greater when participants combined diet plus walking (about 16 pounds) and diet plus weight training (about 17 pounds). Diet alone resulted in about 10 pounds of fat lost over 18 months.\n\n+ Muscle mass loss was greatest with diet plus walking (about 4 pounds) compared with diet alone or diet plus weight training (each about 2 pounds). Put another way, the percentage of weight loss coming from muscle mass was 20% in the weight loss plus walking group, 16% in the weight loss alone group, and 10% in the weight loss plus weight training group.\n\n+ Loss of fat was associated with faster walking speed, while loss of muscle was associated with reduced knee strength.\n\nThese results may be even more important for older adults who gain and lose weight with frequency, because seniors typically don\'t regain muscle - they regain fat mass - which is ""all the more reason for older adults to try and preserve muscle mass during weight loss,"" Beavers said.\n\nThis is the latest study from the Cooperative Lifestyle Intervention Program (CLIP-II), a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a weight-loss-only group, who followed a calorie-restricted diet with no exercise regimen; a weight loss plus cardio (i.e., walking) group; and a weight loss plus weight-training group.\n\n###\n\nCo-authors on this paper included W. Jack Rejeski and Anthony Marsh, co-principal investigators of the CLIP-II study, and Jessica Sheedy, Beverly Nesbit and Jill Gaukstern, all of the Wake Forest University Department of Health and Exercise Science; and Walter Ambrosius, Michael Walkup, Jonathan Burdette and Barbara Nicklas of the Wake Forest School of Medicine.\n\nThe research was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Partial support also comes from grants by the National Institute on Aging.']",No where did the release suggest that seniors should check with their doctors before launching a new exercise program.,"This news release describes a recent study on the effect different exercises combined with calorie restriction had on older adults. The researchers found that, unsurprisingly, exercise combined with diet was more effective at promoting weight loss than diet alone. The researchers also reported that the type of exercise matters in terms of where the weight loss comes from. They found that seniors who used walking as their exercise were more likely to lose muscle mass, while the weight training seniors lost more weight from fat. This is an important distinction, because muscle mass is important for seniors. Loss of muscle mass, the authors reported, can cause reduced knee strength and contribute to other physical disabilities.
However, there is a caveat that wasn’t described in the release. The study’s results apply to seniors with pre-existing mobility limitations and may not be applicable to the general population of seniors. The study was conducted on volunteers who had previously cited a limitation to their mobility. Consequently, their levels of physical activity may have been lower than the average senior at the start of the study and this might lead them to respond more rapidly than someone already in the habit of exercising. For example, when people suddenly pick up weight training they’re more likely to gain muscle (and more quickly) than someone who is already weight training.

This means that many currently available drugs simply won\'t affect it.\n\n""We were surprised [at the results] because triple-negative breast cancer is very difficult to treat,"" said study lead author Dr. Joyce O\'Shaughnessy.\n\n""The big, big surprise was survival,"" added O\'Shaughnessy, who nevertheless stressed that the trial was small and preliminary.\n\nThe findings were enough to generate the interest of Dr. Lisa A. Carey, the co-author of an accompanying editorial.\n\n""It is early, but it\'s really exciting because it\'s a new class of drugs. It isn\'t that often that we have a completely new approach to treating cancer,"" said Carey, medical director of the University of North Carolina Breast Center in Chapel Hill. ""This is a new book. We\'ve just opened it up.""\n\nIniparib inhibits a pathway that helps repair DNA; researchers call it the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) pathway. If this chain is interrupted, cancer cells don\'t have the necessary tools to repair themselves.\n\n""[PARP inhibitors] work by preventing the cells from repairing damage to their DNA,"" Carey explained.\n\nA similar drug, in fact, has shown benefit in patients with BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutations predisposing them to breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nIn this study, 123 patients with triple-negative breast cancer were randomized to receive a commonly used, well-tolerated chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine and carboplatin) or to receive chemo plus iniparib.\n\nMore than one-half of the women responded to the combination treatment (meaning the tumor volume decreased) versus only about one-third of those receiving chemo alone.\n\nWomen receiving iniparib plus chemo lived an average of 12.3 months compared to just 7.7 months in the chemo-alone group. This may not seen like very long in either group, but for this serious a cancer, it is impressive, the researchers noted.\n\nThis was a phase 2 trial. O\'Shaughnessy, who is co-director of breast cancer research at Baylor-Sammons Cancer Center, US Oncology, and Texas Oncology in Dallas, said the results of a larger (about 500 patients) phase 3 trial should be available within one to three months.\n\n""The whole field is still preliminary and we have to be careful not to overhype the results [as] we\'re waiting on the results of the phase 3 trial,"" she said. ""Phase 2 was quite positive, but we really don\'t know if this is going to end up benefiting patients until we get to phase 3.""\n\nIn her editorial accompanying the study, Carey agreed. ""Both excitement and caution are appropriate in interpreting the trial,"" she wrote. ""Some clear drawbacks should be noted."" Among them, she said, were the small size of the study group, ""imbalances at baseline"" favoring the iniparib group, and the ""unconventional"" chemotherapy regimen. But caveats notwithstanding, she concluded, the results may herald improved therapy ""for an underserved subgroup of patients with breast cancer.""\n\nO\'Shaughnessy added that the drug was ""extremely well tolerated [by patients]. It didn\'t seem to add any appreciable toxicity to chemotherapy.""\n\nIn the meantime, she pointed out, a woman walking through a clinic door who is diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer shouldn\'t panic. ""If it\'s only in the breast or lymph nodes, we cure most triple-negative cancers. But when it recurs and becomes metastatic, it\'s very difficult to treat,"" she explained.\n\nThe study was funded by BiPar Sciences, a subsidiary of Sanofi-Aventis which makes the drug.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on breast cancer.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A generally well-done story that unfortunately had a disconnect between the headline – “drug helps fight aggressive breast cancer” – (imagine the impact this might have on some women in that state) and the appropriate caveats deep in the story. </span>","This article reports on a study and accompanying editorial published in The New England Journal of Medicine.  The piece details the results of a Phase 2 trial for the experimental cancer drug Iniparib which was developed to treat triple-negative breast cancer.

For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is an effective component in treating amblyopia, also called “lazy eye,” which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, affecting 3 percent of the population. It may also improve vision in those with mild myopia (nearsightedness).\n\nIt should be acknowledged that some researchers involved in many of these studies have financial ties to GlassesOff. However, other studies with no commercial links obtained similar results, and several scientists I spoke to, including those without ties to GlassesOff, thought the science behind the app was credible. One study published in Psychological Science trained 16 college-aged adults and 16 older adults (around age 71) with Gabor patch exercises for 1.5 hours per day for seven days.

The column wisely notes that the training is laborious, the scientific rationale plausible (it’s been successful for so-called “lazy eye”) if sketchy, and the evidence that it enables people to throw away their bifocals skimpy.

The new analysis singles out adults aged 75 and older and confirms that those with high blood pressure also benefit from the lower pressure target similar to the larger group studied in the earlier research: non-diabetic adults aged 50 and older. These additional results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) appear in the current online issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n\nThe study shows that for adults aged 75 years and older with high blood pressure, a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg reduced rates of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and heart failure, as well as stroke, by 33 percent. This lower blood pressure goal also reduced the risk of death among this group by 32 percent, compared to a target systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg. The benefits of a more aggressive blood pressure intervention occurred in both frail (individuals with several impairments or disorders) and non-frail older participants, the researchers note.\n\nAbout three-fourths of the U.S. population aged 75 and older live with hypertension, a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease and death. Although the standard blood pressure treatment goal is 140 mm Hg, various medical panels have provided inconsistent guidance about what is the optimal blood pressure goal for the senior population. One group has recommended a target blood pressure of 160 mm Hg for persons aged 80 or older, while another recommended a target of 150 mm Hg for adults aged 60 or older. Other experts have supported keeping the standard treatment goal at 140 mm Hg.\n\nTo address this issue, the SPRINT study tapped more than 2,600 volunteers aged 75 and older, assigning half to a target blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and half to target of less than 120 mm Hg. While study participants with the lower blood pressure goal appeared to have better cardiovascular outcomes overall, the researchers caution all other hypertension patients to talk to their doctor to determine whether this lower goal is best for their individual care.\n\nIn addition to primary sponsorship by the NHLBI, SPRINT is co-sponsored by the NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the National Institute on Aging.\n\nWHO: Lawrence Fine, M.D., chief of the Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch at NHLBI and a co-author of the study, is available to comment on the findings and implications of this research.\n\n###\n\nCONTACT: For more information or to schedule an interview, please contact the NHLBI Office of Science Policy, Engagement, Education, and Communications at 301-496-5449 or nhlbi_news@nhlbi.nih.gov (link sends e-mail).\n\nAbout the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI): NHLBI, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans, conducts, and supports research related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, and blood diseases; and sleep disorders.

But the incidence rises with age, to about 15% of elderly people. The rate is also much higher among people who don\'t eat meat or dairy products, people with absorption problems, people taking acid-blocking medications and those with Type 2 diabetes who take the drug Metformin.\n\n""B12 deficiency is much more common than the textbooks and journal articles say it is,"" says Alan Pocinki, an internist in Washington D.C., who routinely tests his patients who fall into those categories. He also notes that since the Metformin connection was discovered only recently, some physicians aren\'t aware of it. ""They assume that if patients complain of numbness and tingling in the feet, it\'s a diabetes issue and not a B12 issue.""\n\nOther symptoms of low B12 include anemia, depression, dementia, confusion, loss of appetite and balance problems. Long-term deficiency can bring severe anemia, nerve damage and neurological changes that may be irreversible.\n\nJust three ounces of clams, breaded and fried, have about 570% of the daily allowance.

Her B12 level was slightly over 200 picograms per milliliter (the normal range is considered 200 to 800 pg per ml). After several weeks of B12 injections, then 1,000 milligrams daily in pill form, her B12 is now over 600 pg per ml and she says she feels better. ""My color is better and the shadows under my eyes are gone,"" she says.\n\nIndeed, several studies have shown that some symptoms of B12 deficiency, particularly early problems with cognitive function, can be apparent even when patients\' blood levels are still in the normal range.\n\nHow Much Recommended Dietary Allowances for vitamin B12 by age: 0-6 months: 400 nanograms\n\n6-12 months: 500 ng\n\n1-3 years: 900 ng\n\n4-8 years: 1.2 micrograms\n\n9-13 years: 1.8 mcg\n\n14 years and older: 2.4 mcg\n\nPregnant women: 2.6 mcg\n\nNursing mothers: 2.8 mcg Source: National Academy of Sciences, 1998\n\nStill, vitamin B12 isn\'t a miracle pick-me-up, a performance enhancer, a weight-loss aid or a quick way to sober up after a long night of drinking, as some celebrities and Internet marketers claim. For people who aren\'t deficient, ""there\'s no evidence whatsoever that these injections are useful to pep you up,"" says Irwin H. Rosenberg, a professor and former dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition at Tufts University. Taking too much B12 is unlikely to be harmful, he adds; the excess is simply excreted.\n\nB12 is one of the newest of the human vitamins, identified in 1948. It originates in bacteria, yeast and microbes in soil. Plants can\'t store it, so people get their B12 almost exclusively from meat, liver, poultry, fish and dairy products. Adults need just 2.4 micrograms a day, the amount in three ounces of beef, and can generally store it in fat tissue for several years. Dr. Pocinki speculates that some of his very lean patients are B12 deficient because they don\'t have much fat to store it in.\n\nSome people have trouble absorbing B12 in the first place. Stomach acid is needed to release it from food particles. People who have used acid-blocking medications, particularly proton-pump inhibitors, for years may not have enough. And many elderly people naturally stop making stomach acid, so B12 deficiencies are increasingly common as people age.\n\nBoosting B12 B12 comes almost exclusively from meat, liver, poultry, fish and dairy products. Some breakfast cereals are also fortified with the vitamin. Selected Food Sources of Vitamin B12 Food Micrograms (mcg) per serving Percent DV* Liver, beef, braised, 1 slice 48 800 Clams, cooked, breaded and fried, 3 ounces 34.2 570 Breakfast cereals, fortified with 100% of the DV for vitamin B12, 1 serving 6 100 Trout, rainbow, wild, cooked, 3 ounces 5.4 90 Salmon, sockeye, cooked, 3 ounces 4.9 80 Trout, rainbow, farmed, cooked, 3 ounces 4.2 50 Beef, top sirloin, broiled, 3 ounces 2.4 40 Cheeseburger, double patty and bun, 1 sandwich 1.9 30 Breakfast cereals, fortified with 25% of the DV for vitamin B12, 1 serving 1.5 25 Yogurt, plain, 1 cup 1.4 25 Haddock, cooked, 3 ounces 1.2 20 Tuna, white, 3 ounces 1 15 Milk, 1 cup 0.9 15 Cheese, Swiss, 1 ounce 0.9 15 Beef taco, 1 taco 0.8 13 Ham, cured, roasted, 3 ounces 0.6 10 Egg, large, 1 whole 0.6 10 Chicken, roasted, ½ breast 0.3 6\n\nThat\'s why the Institute of Medicine recommends that people over age 51 get most of their daily requirement from B12 supplements or cereals fortified with the vitamin that break down more easily in the digestive tract.\n\nFurther down the digestive tract, B12 must combine with a protein called intrinsic factor to be absorbed into the body. Without intrinsic factor, people absorb much less B12, resulting in a condition called pernicious anemia, in which red blood cells don\'t develop properly. Left untreated, pernicious anemia can bring on neurological changes, delusions and hallucinations. The discovery that eating large amounts of liver could cure pernicious anemia led to the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1934.\n\nOther conditions can also interfere with B12 absorption, including celiac disease and Crohn\'s disease. ""I thought I was going to die in my sleep because I had so little energy,"" says Ellen Icochea, a senior executive at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who had a very low B12 level along with several major medical problems. Weekly B12 injections made a dramatic difference. ""It was like, \'Wow, here\'s energy!\' "" she says.\n\nDavid H. Johnson, a 54-year old wildlife biologist, takes B12 shots every three days to cope with the challenges of chronic fatigue syndrome. ""Imagine you are on a small roller coaster,"" he says. ""You feel up one day and the next and then you start slumping until you\'re really flat again.""\n\nB12 comes in pill form and a new nasal spray, but injections are the fastest way to correct a severe deficiency, since it does not need to be absorbed in the digestive tract. Many patients learn to inject themselves or have a spouse do it to cut down on doctor visits. ""I have world travelers who take their B12 and needles with them. It\'s like traveling with insulin,"" says Dr. Pocinki.\n\nHe says he has seen low-grade depression lift when patients were given B12 supplements.\n\nResearchers are still investigating possible links between long-term B12 deficiency and other health problems. It\'s known, for example, that B12 and the other B vitamins help reduce homocysteine, an amino acid in the bloodstream that may be associated with heart disease. But several large prospective studies have not shown that taking B12 supplements reduces the risk.\n\nIt\'s also not clear whether low B12 raises the risk of dementia and Alzheimer\'s disease, although cognitive impairment brought on by low B12 is sometimes mistaken for Alzheimer\'s.\n\n""It\'s really easy to miss, and really easy to fix,"" says Dr. Pocinki.\n\nAn additional concern: A high level of folic acid can mask symptoms of B12 deficiency, and many people are getting more folic acid than they realize. Since 1996, all enriched flour must contain folic acid to reduce the risk of neural-tube defects, a severe malformation that occurs in developing fetuses. Some studies suggest that having high folic acid can make cognitive damage from low B12 even worse.\n\n""To this day, we are concerned about the trade-off,"" says Dr. Rosenberg, who was on the advisory panel that recommended enriching flour.\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com']","This column could have shed light on an uncommon vitamin deficiency that has important medical consequences for some people. Instead, it presents a series of unsubstantiated and loosely connected claims that are supported by anecdotes.","This column provided a string of narratives from people with wellness issues who report personal benefit from supplementation with vitamin B12.  In so doing, the story made vitamin B12 appear to be the solution to many of life’s ills without thoughtfully examining alternative sources for the problems listed, the quality of the evidence indicating the vitamin’s benefit in the absence of deficiency, and was not even clear about the benefits that might be obtained from vitamin B12.

Several companies do not sell tests in China or India, where boys are prized over girls and fetuses found to be female have been aborted. While sex selection is not considered a widespread objective in the United States, companies say that occasionally customers expressed that interest, and have been denied the test. A recent study of third pregnancies in the journal Prenatal Diagnosis found that in some Asian-American groups, more boys than girls are born in ratios that are “strongly suggesting prenatal sex selection,” the authors said.\n\nAt least one company, Consumer Genetics, which sells the Pink or Blue test, requires customers to sign a waiver saying they are not using the test for that purpose. “We don’t want this technology to be used as a method of gender selection,” said the company’s executive vice president, Terry Carmichael. Sex-determination tests are part of a new frontier of fetal DNA testing, which can be used to determine paternity and blood type, and is being used to develop early screening tests for genetic diseases or disorders like Down syndrome.\n\nThe new study found that to be reliable, the sex-determination tests had to be performed after at least seven weeks of gestation. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother’s blood, not urine. And certain rigorous laboratory procedures had to be followed. For the blood tests, women prick their fingers and send blood samples to labs. If the Y chromosome is detected, the fetus is male. Absence of a Y chromosome would probably mean the fetus is female, but could mean that fetal DNA was not found in that sample.\n\nThe tests are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration because they are not used for medical purposes, a spokeswoman said, but the agency is investigating the explosion of home genetic tests like these and genome-sequencing kits.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Diana Bianchi, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and the lead author of the sex-determination report, said, “A very important aspect of the study is how this advances prenatal care.”\n\nBut there are potential concerns too, she said, including that women may spend more than $250 for the tests when they don’t have insurance for prenatal care. A typical blood test like Pink or Blue, for example, costs $25 for the kit. Lab fees and shipping costs, which vary, bring the total expense to $265 to $330.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Bianchi is conducting another study to “try to find out why people are buying these things and what are the consequences,” she said. “It’s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These tests analyze hormones in women’s urine, a method that several experts said has not been studied as rigorously as DNA. Rebecca Griffin, a founder of the biggest seller, Intelligender, said two independent studies found it 90 percent accurate at 10 weeks.\n\nAnother company, TrovaGene, has developed a DNA test using urine, which, according to Gabriele Cerrone, TrovaGene’s co-founder and director, is 95 percent accurate at predicting boys at seven weeks, and 88 percent accurate at predicting girls. TrovaGene is also developing a test for Down syndrome.\n\nMost DNA tests on the market use blood.\n\nRaylene Lewis, 34, of College Station, Tex., had a frustrating experience with a now-defunct company, Acu-Gen, which guaranteed 99.9 percent accuracy with its blood tests. In 2005, she was told she was having a boy, and she chose a name, bought boy clothes and told everyone. When an ultrasound revealed she was carrying a girl, “I was absolutely shocked,“ she said. She was not unhappy, she said, but “it was like the baby boy disappeared.”\n\nWhen the Lewises complained to Acu-Gen’s president, they were told, “We are very sure that genetically you are having a male,” she said, reading a transcript of the conversation, which they recorded. The official suggested that the baby might be “what a baby girl looks like on the outside,” but that “we’re giving you the results on the inside.”\n\nMs. Lewis, who sued Acu-Gen, said she ultimately received a refund. Lawyers for Acu-Gen could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Pink or Blue test, which claims 95 percent accuracy at seven weeks and gives refunds for wrong results, appears to meet the standards described in the new study.\n\nChelsea Wallace, 23, of Okeechobee, Fla., was thrilled early this year when the test she took at seven weeks said she was having a boy, a result confirmed weeks later by ultrasound. Ms. Wallace, who has a 3-year-old daughter, said she also would have been happy with a girl, but that since she and her fiancé could not agree on a boy’s name, finding out early gave them time to choose the name Layton. It also helped her plan, she said.\n\n“As soon as I found out I was pregnant,” said Ms. Wallace, whose son is due in September, “I wanted to know what I was having.”""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">It struck our reviewers that this piece had more consumer-helpful information than a </span>","The story outlines how new research about an existing family of consumer blood tests shows accuracy at seven weeks into pregnancy for determining the sex of a fetus. What the story also tells is the complicated weighing of risks and benefits that parents may need to use, since the consumer tests and their laboratories are not regulated by the FDA.

They also considered how easy each diet was to follow, as well as safety and nutritional value.\n\n""Besides the rankings and data, each diet has a detailed profile that includes how it works, evidence that supports or refutes its claims and a nutritional snapshot -- tools that, along with the advice of a physician or nutritionist, can help consumers invest in diets that suit their lifestyles and further their health and wellness goals,"" Haupt said.\n\nThe panel evaluated 38 of the most popular or trendy diets this year. After ranking them in nine categories, the experts found the MIND diet tied for second place for best overall diet with the cholesterol-lowering TLC diet. The MIND diet includes some features of the DASH diet and Mediterranean diet, such as high consumption of fruits, vegetables and fish, but focuses on foods that promote brain health.\n\nThe MIND diet ranked first in the ""Easiest Diet to Follow"" category in a three-way tie with Weight Watchers and the Fertility diet, which asserts that certain dietary changes can boost fertility.\n\nThe Fertility diet, which calls for the elimination of trans fats, also ranked as the best diet for diabetes, the report revealed.

One expert, Dr. Dale Bredesen, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss, a hallmark of the disease.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Aging, Bredesen and colleagues showed how 10 patients who were experiencing age-related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND), a 36-point individualized regimen of diet, exercise, brain stimulation, sleep improvements, medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to 24 months.\n\nFor example, an MRI of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the 17th percentile for his age range prior to MEND. (The hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in Alzheimer\'s patients.) After 10 months of following the prescribed protocol, his hippocampal volume increased to the 75th percentile.\n\nThe study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline, were able to return to work after adopting MEND and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance.\n\n""Lives have been dramatically impacted,"" Bredesen told CBS News. ""I\'m enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol.""\n\nJames E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of clinical biomedical science at FAU\'s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study, agreed that personalized approaches such as the MEND protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward. ""It\'s important to be excited about this approach,"" he told CBS News. However, Galvin cautioned, ""I\'m not sure about the method.""\n\nThe MEND protocol, outlined in a 2014 study in the journal Aging, calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with Alzheimer\'s such as inflammation, stress and diabetes. However, MEND also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require FDA approval.\n\n""Not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them,"" Galvin told CBS News.\n\nBut Bredesen believes that the only way to treat Alzheimer\'s is to treat all of the underlying problems, which may require intervention with supplements. ""Nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress reduction -- these are all critical pieces of this,"" he told CBS News. ""It\'s about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics, whatever it takes.""\n\nBut even if MEND is effective, the program is complex and difficult to follow. A Buck Institute press release on the study stated: ""None of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol. The significant diet and lifestyle changes, and multiple pills required each day, were the two most common complaints.""\n\nBredesen said that to simplify the program, they are connecting patients with health coaches. ""We\'re trying to make it simpler, but we don\'t want to lose the efficacy,"" he said.\n\nBredesen noted, too, that the MEND protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer\'s. One participant from the 2014 study, who had been diagnosed with late-stage Alzheimer\'s, did not show improvements with the protocol.\n\n""If you told me that your mother is 86 and living in a home, I would say that I\'d want to treat you,"" he said. ""It\'s about prevention.""\n\nBredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible.\n\nGalvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported. ""This is moving in the right direction,"" he told CBS News. ""These anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion.""']","The story follows a tired formula of teasing readers with hopeful statements about a potential cure, only to conclude with the caveat that more study is needed to determine whether the idea will actually work.","This story springs from a published paper on 10 case studies of patients who followed a program to reverse memory loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease.
To its credit, the story does note significant limitations with the study and quotes an independent source who casts some cold water on the findings.
But, the story was problematic on several fronts. Most importantly, it contains several errors. For example, it incorrectly states that all 10 patients showed brain scan improvements after following the therapy; in fact just one patient met that benchmark. And it skipped any mention of costs, potential harms, conflicts of interest, or funding sources.
Overall, it follows a tired formula of teasing readers with hopeful statements about a potential cure, only to conclude with the caveat that more study is needed to determine whether the idea will actually work.

Even low levels of dehydration can seriously compromise normal physiological function, yet recent studies looking at hydration in laboring women via the rates of intravenous (IV) fluid showed conflicting results. By pooling the data of several studies, Thomas Jefferson University researchers showed that a higher rate of IV fluids not only decreased c-section rates, but also shortened the overall length of labor by one hour, as well as shortened the pushing phase. The results were published online as an accepted article in Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.\n\n""The results are compelling and strongly argue for a change in practice,"" says Vincenzo Berghella, M.D., the Director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. ""We have already begun changing practice at Jefferson to give women more fluids in labor, to allow them to have the best chance of delivering vaginally.""\n\nDr. Berghella and colleagues compiled data from seven small clinical trials that collectively included a total of 1,215 women. Of those, about half (or 593 women) received IV fluids at a rate of 250 milliliters per hour, and the other half (622 women) received fluids at the lower rate of 125 milliliters per hour. General practice in the United States is to administer IV fluids at 125 milliliters per hour during labor.\n\nWith the data pooled, the researchers could see a clear difference in outcomes for women in the two groups. Women getting the faster fluid rate (250 milliliters per hour) were less likely to get a cesarean section. The higher fluid rate also reduced the overall time of labor by an average of 64 minutes, and shortened the pushing phase by nearly 3 minutes, on average.\n\n""We\'ve known that it\'s important for women to stay well hydrated during pregnancy and labor. This study suggests that IV fluids could help women maintain hydration at appropriate levels, reduce the likelihood of c-section, and decrease length of labor,"" says Dr. Berghella. ""Recently, we also showed that letting women eat more liberally in labor, especially in early labor, has benefits including shorter labor, and no identifiable risks.""\n\nToday, approximately one in three births in the United States occurs via c-section, despite an increased attention by national and international obstetric societies on safely reducing the practice. This study and others are providing evidence for changes in obstetric practice that could help safely reduce c-section rates. Drs.

The study described here explores the possible benefits of increased hydration during labor and finds, via a well-designed meta-analysis, that giving low-risk, first-time mothers more fluids via intravenous (IV) therapy during labor reduces the number of cesarean sections, as well as the overall length of labor.
The news release offers readers a summary of the findings without much detail and, importantly, fails to note that the women included in the analysis cannot be generalized to all women in labor.

(March 10, 2016) - Approximately 14 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lifetimes, according to the National Institutes of Health. Radiation therapy traditionally has been a primary treatment for the cancer, but one-fourth of men have a recurrence of prostate cancer within five years after the therapy. Now, a University of Missouri School of Medicine researcher has found that a complex procedure to remove the prostate achieves excellent long-term survival for men after radiation therapy has failed.\n\n""Prostate cancer, unfortunately, is a common cancer, and more than 27,000 men are estimated to have died from the disease in 2015,"" said Naveen Pokala, M.D., an assistant professor in the Division of Urology at the MU School of Medicine and lead author of the study. ""By studying a national database of prostate cancer cases, we found that a procedure known as salvage radical prostatectomy can greatly increase a man\'s chance of survival when traditional radiation therapy has failed to eradicate the cancer.""\n\nUsing the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program database, Pokala and his research team studied 364 patients who underwent a salvage radical prostatectomy surgery after unsuccessful radiation treatments. Looking at survival rates, the researchers found that 88.6 percent of men were still alive 10 years later and 72.7 percent of men were still alive 20 years later.\n\nDuring a salvage radical prostatectomy, the prostate gland and surrounding tissue are surgically removed to keep the cancer from spreading. The procedure is challenging because tissue that surrounds the prostate is scarred during radiation treatment, making it difficult for the surgeon to identify and cut out tissue that needs to be removed.

These are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way.\n\n“It’s like you’re possessed,” said Lorie Novak, who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood. “I almost feel separate from my body, like it’s just this painful shell around me that’s not me.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nNovak, now in her 60s, is one of the roughly 35 million Americans who suffer from migraines. There are few effective treatments, and no new drugs have been developed since the early 1990s.\n\nBut that could soon change. A handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines, chasing a blockbuster market that Wall Street analysts say could reach $8 billion a year in worldwide sales.\n\nThe new drugs target a bodily protein called CGRP, which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Scientists haven’t nailed down just how the protein affects migraines, but they’re sure about two things: CGRP levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away.\n\nAnd thus four drug makers — Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals — have fashioned antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block their activity. The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks.\n\nSo far, it seems to be working. In mid-stage clinical trials, each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants, cutting the number of days they’re afflicted by migraines roughly in half. It’s by no means a cure for migraines, but it should be enough to merit Food and Drug Administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials, according to Eric Schmidt, a securities analyst at Cowen and Co.\n\nEach treatment is now in late-stage development, targeting the roughly 38 percent of migraine sufferers who, like Novak, have at least four headache days per month. The first therapy could hit the market in 2018, and, if everything works out, all four could available by the end of the decade.\n\nSo far, the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials, and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share.\n\n“There will certainly be hypercompetition,” said William Ratner, Lilly’s senior director of global headache marketing. But the companies’ fortunes are intertwined, he said, and “the class only wins if headache care in America improves.”\n\nAiming to prevent migraines before they start\n\nThere’s plenty of room for improvement. Existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects, and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed “Sleepomax” by doctors and patients because it’s also a heavy sedative.\n\n“I’m very enthusiastic, as I think everyone in the field is, about having another treatment option for people with migraines,” said Dr. Elizabeth Loder, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\n\nTargeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. Researchers picked up on the protein’s scent more than 30 years ago, and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity. Merck got all the way into late-stage trials with an anti-CGRP tablet, spending more than $1 billion only to find in 2011 that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future.\n\nWith the “exquisite sensitivity” of an antibody, however, scientists believe they can block CGRP without triggering dangerous side effects, Alder CEO Randy Schatzman said.\n\nBecause antibodies stay active in the body for weeks, the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies, injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay. (Merck’s failed pill, by contrast, was meant as an on-the-spot treatment after the pain started.)\n\n“So in some senses, it’s a paradigm shift,” Schatzman said.\n\nBut there are still hurdles to clear. Only about half of patients seem to respond to CGRP antibodies, and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time. A genetic test would be “the Holy Grail of personalized medicine,” said Rob Lenz, Amgen’s global development lead for neuroscience, but no one has made one yet.\n\nAnd long-term safety remains a major question mark. To date, none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials, but they’ve only reported data from 12-week studies on about 1,500 total patients. It will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time, Loder said.\n\n‘I felt like my life was being stolen from me’\n\nAny advance, even an incremental one, would be a major leap for the field, said Emily Bates, who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the University of Colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment.\n\nBates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college. Like many patients, she didn’t respond to any of the preventative therapies available.\n\n“The pain is more than anything I’ve ever experienced, and I’ve run on broken legs before,” she said. “I felt like my life was being stolen from me.”\n\nCollectively, Americans miss about 113 million workdays each year because of migraine. That lost productivity costs society about $13 billion each year, according to the Migraine Research Foundation.\n\nYet scientific progress has been slow, in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding, Bates said.\n\nIt’s a “subjective symptom that predominantly affects women,” said Loder, the Harvard neurologist. “That’s a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it.”\n\nNovak, a professor of photography at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition. But she decided to change all that in 2009 with a project called Migraine Register. She takes a photo of herself each day she has a migraine. Some years, that’s more than 120 pictures.\n\nThe idea, in part, was to humanize chronic migraines. But the project also forced Novak to reckon with the toll of the disease, something she had tried to ignore for years.\n\n“That for me was like a concrete proof of how it really does affect my life,” Novak said, “of how much time I lose.”""]",The story tells us that migraine-days were cut in half. But half of what?,"Migraine headaches are a problem for millions of individuals, and current treatments are sometimes insufficient, leaving people to cope as best they can with this often debilitating condition. This story is an overview about how four drug companies are working to develop injectable drugs whose antibodies would bind to a protein that plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain, the purported cause of headaches.
The story’s headline—’The drug industry might finally have an answer for migraines’—is accurate, given its emphasis on conditional tense. But the drugs are still in development, and the story lacked important details on the trial data to indicate what potential these drugs may have. It tells us, for example, that migraine-days were cut in half. But half of what? Also, given the extensive sourcing of drug company representatives, we would have liked to have seen more specifics on the quality of the clinical trial evidence, the anticipated costs of these drugs, and side effects.

There are only a few approved medications for the condition, which causes chronic aches and pains, sleep disturbances, fatigue and depression. Many patients opt for a combination of medications, lifestyle changes and cognitive behavioral therapy to remain functional.\n\n\n\nA study released Wednesday suggests that tai chi, a Chinese form of martial arts, significantly improves symptoms. Tai chi is a mind-body practice that uses gentle movement, breathing exercises and relaxation to move energy -- called qi -- throughout the body. In the study, researchers at Tufts Medical Center in Boston assigned 33 fibromyalgia patients to a tai chi program and 33 patients to a program consisting of wellness education and stretching. Both groups participated in one-hour sessions, twice a week for 12 weeks.\n\n\n\nThe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the patients in the tai chi group improved much more than the control-group patients. On a 100-point scale that measures fibromyalgia symptoms, with 100 being the most severe, the tai chi patients\' scores decreased an average of 27.8 points compared to 9.4 points in the control group. More people in the tai chi group stopped taking their medications and reported better sleep quality and less pain and depression.\n\n\n\nHow tai chi works to reduce fibromyalgia symptoms is unknown, but it is likely a multi-factorial impact that includes improved muscle strength, psychosocial well-being, relaxation and rest that ""may raise pain thresholds and help break the \'pain cycle,\' "" the authors wrote.\n\n\n\nAn editorial accompanying the paper called the results ""striking"" but said it\'s too early for a doctor to ""take out a prescription pad and write \'tai chi.\' "" The results of the study could be due to an enthusiastic tai chi teacher and the well-known placebo effect, the authors of the editorial wrote. Future studies should rigorously test similar therapies, such as yoga, to compare results.

Cytology-based screening, known as the Pap test or Pap smear, is used to detect abnormal cells. The Pap test can also find noncancerous conditions, such as infections and inflammation.\n\nCervical cancer screening guidelines have changed dramatically over the last 15 years, following introduction of testing for the dozen high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types that cause virtually all cervical cancer and its precursors. Despite more research into HPV, and the introduction of preventive HPV vaccines, screening will remain important and comprise many millions of tests annually for decades to come. But improved screening methods have also introduced some confusion, even controversy.\n\nHPV testing is more sensitive than the Pap test for detecting precancer. The HPV test captures the known cancer causing viruses, but there are gynecologists who believe that there may be unknown cancer causing viruses and so continue to do the Pap smear (plus HPV testing).\n\nHowever, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. An HPV test, in which doctors test a cervicovaginal specimen for the presence of the nucleic acids of carcinogenic types of HPV, is more sensitive than the Pap test (a microscopic examination of exfoliated cells) for detection of precancers. Thus, if a single screening method were chosen to complement HPV vaccination, primary HPV testing likely would gradually supplant the Pap test.\n\nIn the US, an interim guidance issued by a committee of experts from several clinical societies recommended primary HPV testing every three years, the same as the Pap test. Alternatively, current guidelines recommend cotesting but, in recognition of the additional reassurance provided by this approach compared with the Pap test alone, the screening interval is extended to every five years. Draft guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended either primary HPV testing every five years or the Pap test every three years for women 30 to 64, and did not recommend cotesting.\n\nThe accumulated evidence supports inclusion of HPV testing in screening; thus, the main choice moving forward is between cotesting and primary HPV testing alone.\n\nResearchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial.\n\nIn January 2003, just prior to US FDA approval of HPV and Pap test cotesting in mid-2003 and interim guidelines in 2004, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care organization, introduced three-year cotesting in women aged 30 years and older. Kaiser Permanente has now screened over a million women by cotesting. This remains the most extensive experience of HPV testing incorporated into routine screening in the world.\n\nResearchers here quantified the detection of cervical precancer and cancer by cotesting compared with HPV testing alone at Kaiser Permanente, where 1,208,710 women have undergone triennial cervical cotesting since 2003. Screening histories preceding cervical cancers (n=623) and precancers (n=5,369) were examined to assess the relative contribution of the Pap test and HPV test components in identifying cases.\n\nThe analysis found that HPV testing identified more women subsequently diagnosed with cancer and precancer than the Pap test. HPV testing was statistically significantly more likely to be positive for cancer at any time point, except within 12 months. HPV-negative/ Pap test-positive results preceded only small fractions of cases of precancer (3.5%) and cancer (5.9%); these cancers were more likely to be regional or distant stage than other cases.\n\nGiven the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year. Two-thirds (67.9%) of women found to have cancer up to 10 years of follow-up at Kaiser Permanente were detected by the first cotest performed.\n\nThe researchers conclude that the added sensitivity of cotesting versus HPV alone for detection of treatable cancer affected extremely few women.?\n\n###\n\nThe paper ""Relative Performance of HPV and Cytology Components of Cotesting in Cervical Screening"" is available at: https:/ / doi. org/ 10. 1093/ jnci/ djx225\n\nDirect correspondence to:\n\nMark SchiffmanDivision of Cancer Epidemiology and GeneticsNational Cancer InstituteBethesda, MD\n\nTo request a copy of the study, please contact: Daniel Luzer\n\ndaniel.luzer@oup.com\n\nSharing on social media? Find Oxford Journals online at @OxfordJournals']",More discussion on the potential cost savings would have rounded this release out nicely.,"In a 12-year study of more than a million women in the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California system, researchers concluded that the HPV screening test alone may be enough to detect the vast majority of cancers and so-called “pre-cancers” without the added second test known as the Pap test. In the study, women received both tests. The study examined patients who had cancer or pre-cancer to determine whether their disease would have been missed by HPV testing alone. The release states: “Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year.”
This study concludes that double-testing or co-testing is only protecting a tiny minority of patients, and that a single HPV test may be enough. Even though economics is part of the reason for the study,  the release does not tell us how much money might be saved if a single test became the standard of care.

Reiman wrote a commentary that accompanies the study in Nature.\n\nBut it will take much larger studies to show for sure whether aducanumab really does slow down Alzheimer\'s disease, Reiman says.\n\nOfficials of Biogen, which is developing the drug, were also cautious about interpreting the results of the study, which included 165 patients in the early stages of Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\n""We think we have something important here,"" says Dr. Alfred Sandrock, chief medical officer for Biogen. ""We hope we\'re right because if it\'s true it would benefit millions of patients. But we don\'t know we\'re right yet.""\n\n\n\nThe results are encouraging for pharmaceutical companies that have spent billions of dollars on efforts to come up with the first drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer\'s. Those efforts have failed to produce a single approved drug so far.\n\nBut last summer, Biogen began presenting its results with aducanumab at scientific meetings, including the Alzheimer\'s Association International Conference in July. These early reports suggested the drug had a remarkable ability to remove plaques in the brain.\n\n""It was surprising, encouraging and thought-provoking to see such a striking reduction of existing plaques,"" Reiman says.\n\nThe publication in Nature on Wednesday provides details about those early reports.\n\nBiogen has already begun two much larger studies of aducanumab. They will include a total of 2,700 patients, and results are still several years off.\n\nBut there are reasons to think aducanumab may succeed where other drugs have failed.\n\nOne is that the drug appears to ignore benign forms of amyloid protein while attacking the toxic forms thought to damage brain cells. Another is that aducanumab seems to enhance the ability of existing immune cells in the brain to devour toxins, including amyloid.\n\nBut there\'s a downside. The process of removing plaque sometimes causes fluid to build up in the brain. In rare cases, it can also cause bleeding.

Twenty patients dropped out of the trial because of adverse effects.\n\nIf aducanumab works in larger studies, it could help settle a long-running debate about whether amyloid is really the root cause of Alzheimer\'s. This idea is known as the amyloid hypothesis.\n\nAnd large studies showing that removing amyloid can preserve memory and thinking ""would go a long way toward validating the amyloid hypothesis,"" Sandrock says.\n\nResults like those could also lead to the first approved drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer\'s rather than just the symptoms.']",This story smartly explains that we don’t know yet if amyloid reduction equals reduced risk of disease.,"This NPR story discusses early studies on an experimental amyloid-reducing drug that researchers hope may prevent Alzheimer’s disease. It does a good job of balancing the promise of the drug with realistic assessments about the early stage of the research and the fact that there are potential downsides to this treatment.
Importantly, and in contrast to many stories we’ve seen that report on experimental Alzheimer’s drugs, the story doesn’t equate amyloid reduction with reduced risk of disease. It acknowledges that we don’t know whether amyloid is actually the cause of the Alzheimer’s or a by-product of some process that begins elsewhere. That’s important context. Still, the story would’ve been better with a more precise description of the benefits seen in early studies and with perspective from a truly independent source. It also should have explained why some of these same results, reported last year, were generally greeted with disappointment.
That being said, we were glad to see that this story avoided the hype that so many other outlets chose to stoke with headlines like these:

If so, science has some good news for you: Eating hot chili peppers may help you live longer.\n\nA new study, published in PLoS ONE, found that consumption of hot red chili peppers was associated with a 13 percent lower risk of death.\n\nThe research is observational, so no cause and effect relationship can be established. Still, the authors say the study strengthens the growing body of evidence that spicy food may have protective health properties that can lead to a longer life.\n\nFor the study, researchers at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont analyzed data on more than 16,000 Americans using the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES). Participants were followed for an average of 18.9 years.\n\nThe researchers note that people who ate hot red chili peppers tended to be “younger, male, white, Mexican-American, married, and to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and consume more vegetables and meats . . . had lower HDL-cholesterol, lower income, and less education,” in comparison to participants who did not consume red chili peppers.\n\nThough the mechanism by which chili peppers could help delay death is not well understood, there are some theories.\n\nPrevious, mostly experimental research has suggested that spices and their bioactive ingredient, capsaicin, have anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties.\n\nThe authors say capsaicin also possesses antimicrobial properties that “may indirectly affect the host by altering the gut microbiota.”\n\nThe research corroborates a 2015 study conducted in China and published in the BMJ that found regular consumption of spicy food is associated with a lower risk of death.\n\nBut experts caution that this doesn’t mean everyone should pile on the spices at dinner time to improve their health and increase their longevity. People with gastrointestinal issues, for example, should hold off on the hot sauce.\n\n“For those who are affected by digestive disorders such as a stomach ulcer, I would be cautious about eating spicy foods,” Lu Qi, of Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, and lead author of The BMJ study, told CBS News.\n\nThe authors suggest further research should investigate the benefits of other spices and the effects of certain chili pepper subtypes.\n\n“Such evidence may lead to new insights into the relationships between diet and health, updated dietary recommendations, and the development of new therapies,” they write.']","In this study, hot chili peppers were associated with a longer life but also lower income and higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption.","The story opens with a click-bait headline, a brief description of the main study finding, and then pulls its own punch by detailing the limitations of the observational study. We’re pleased to see the caveats high up before any readers head to the grocery to buy some red hot chili peppers. But we’d be happier to see such a story be put into more context, with some discussion of other dietary factors that affect death rates and some outside experts to comment on what this study really means for the American eaters of any kind of peppers.

Growing up, he was “a jumper and a rebounder,” he said, scooping basketballs off the rim during Roxbury pickup games and later playing in high school and college.\n\nFor a generation that pounded its joints doing aerobics, running marathons, and carving up the ski slopes, it’s time to roll out the spare parts.\n\nBaby boomers, determined to keep moving no matter what wear and tear and arthritis have wrought, are fueling a surge in joint replacements. Taking advantage of improved artificial joints and surgical methods, aging Americans are getting so many new hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles that orthopedic surgeons are having trouble meeting the demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHip replacements in the United States more than doubled between 2000 and 2014 — from 160,282 to 371,605 a year — according to the most recent data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, which tracks hospital discharges. Knee replacements increased at an even faster clip in the same period, from 274,467 to 680,886.\n\nThe procedures can cost up to $50,000 for knees and $40,000 for hips, though the prices vary widely among Medicare and private insurers, which typically bear the bulk of the cost. The average age of patients listed in the American Joint Replacement Registry is about 66.\n\nWith millions more boomers still in their late 50s and early 60s, the trend will only continue.\n\n“They’re aging, they’ve had some injuries, and they want to continue to be active into their 60s, 70s, and 80s. And they need a good joint to do that,” said Dr. David Mattingly, surgeon in chief at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, one of the nation’s top orthopedics centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA patient looked at joint replacement models. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe staff\n\nThe surgical surge has created an expanding brigade of bionic baby boomers whose artificial parts are accompanied by sky-high expectations — something doctors struggle to manage. Despite steady improvement in technology and outcomes, replacement joints don’t create superhumans. Still, many patients are lifelong fitness buffs who begin plotting their return to the gym, the golf course, or the cross-country skiing trails the moment they are discharged from the hospital.\n\nWinthrop retiree John Carver, 76, is already back at the fitness center after having replacement surgery on his right knee in February. “My goal is to get back to an hour — 30 minutes on the elliptical and some back exercises,” he said. A Marine veteran who ran the New York City Marathon the year he turned 40, Carver has scheduled a similar procedure on his left knee in May, early enough “to be ready for golf season.”\n\nFor those who are still working at physically demanding jobs, there are other considerations.\n\n“I’m up and down the scaffolding all day,” said David Smith, 62, of Arlington, a construction superintendent in Boston who had a hip replacement in January. “My first focus was to just get on my feet so I can work another 10 years. So I said, ‘OK, let’s get this done.’ ”\n\nSmith, who played hockey in college and as an adult and spent years lifting heavy equipment on building sites, plans to return to his job this spring. But he has already resumed golfing — on a March trip to visit his son and his family in Atlanta. And, he promised, “I will get on the skates again.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Smith, many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery, pain caused by “bone-on-bone” friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning. Some took multiple cortisone shots, hoping to avoid surgeries. But having had the procedures, many say they wish they’d done it sooner.\n\nWest Newbury’s town clerk, Mike McCarron,, 62, played high school and college football and once climbed Mount Washington in the winter. McCarron underwent two knee replacements simultaneously in 2011. “I had a coupon,” he joked. Now he runs on the treadmill at his Merrimack Valley gym and hikes in the Maine wilderness.\n\nSusan Nadworny, 61, of Melrose, owned an aerobics studio in Boston’s North End during the 1980s and 1990s. There, she spent three or four hours a day leading high-impact exercise classes. Nadworny, who now works as a public policy advocate for people with disabilities, had knee replacement surgery last April. Nearly a year later, she pedals an indoor exercise bicycle and spends an hour a day walking dogs in the woods.\n\nThe vast majority of joint-surgery patients report much less pain and greater mobility afterward, with success rates topping 95 percent, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, a physicians organization. In patient-reported surveys, some still complain of pain and tissue inflammation after their procedures. Smaller numbers suffer serious complications, ranging from blood clotting to hospital-acquired infections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt New England Baptist, a physical therapist showed patients about to have joints replaced how to use crutches. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe staff\n\nNew England Baptist expects to perform a record 7,000 knee and hip replacements at its Mission Hill campus this year, a nearly sixfold increase from the 1,200 annually it did in the mid-1980s. “Most of the busy guys do 15 to 20 a week,” Mattingly said.\n\nLast year, the average salary for joint-replacement specialists topped $575,000, reported the Dallas consulting firm Merritt Hawkins & Associates, compared with just over $230,000 for family doctors.\n\nBecause of improvements in materials and the way they’re treated and sterilized, implants — which include polyethylene and titanium alloys — don’t wear down as fast as they once did. Implants now have a 90 percent chance of lasting two decades, much longer than in the past, Mattingly said.\n\nWhile physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration, genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when, he said. Knee replacements were first offered in the 1960s, and hip replacements began in the 1940s, so many boomers are facing the same surgeries their fathers and mothers underwent.\n\nBut boomers may have a tougher time coming to terms with the reality that a new body part doesn’t mean they can resume all of the high-impact activities that were a major part of their lives.\n\n“Nobody will return to playing football,” Mattingly said. “The person who struggles is the one who’s done long-distance running for years and just doesn’t want to give it up.”\n\nTechnology could eventually change that. Joint implants have become more customized to suit individual patients, but a Billerica company is pushing the personalization trend further. ConforMIS Inc. uses 3-D printing and imaging software to more precisely tailor replacement joints. It sells between 17,000 and 20,000 personalized knee implants a year — still a small share of the market — and last year won US regulatory approval for its first hip implants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The baby boomer explosion is a big deal in health care,” said ConforMIS chief executive Mark Augusti. “Technology has to be part of the solution. Baby boomers expect to be more active as they get older and have higher expectations about quality of life in their later years.”\n\nStephanie Donvan, 60, of Arlington, who received a ConforMIS knee replacement in May, recalled feeling like she was “carrying a dead tree trunk” before the surgery.\n\nNow, she said, “I’m out walking my Lab about five miles a day, every day. I can run in the snow and ride my bike. I have complete range of motion . . . We want to keep going till we’re in our 80s or 90s. We don’t want to give up all the things we’re doing.”\n\nRobert Weisman can be reached at robert.weisman@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @GlobeRobW.']","This was amplified by the lack of specific data on benefits for patients, and the only expert quoted has a conflict of interest that wasn’t disclosed.","This story reported on the growing popularity of joint replacement surgery, which it said is driven by Baby Boomers who want to take advantage of improving technology to regain their active lifestyles.
To its credit, the story addressed costs, highlighted overly optimistic expectations by patients, and mentioned the generous incomes of surgeons who perform these operations. Yet, in some parts of the story, it reads like an advertisement for joint replacements and for the doctors and hospitals that perform them, compounded by futuristic terminology like “bionic.”
This was amplified by the lack of specific data on benefits for patients, and the only expert quoted has a conflict of interest that wasn’t disclosed. The story also could have mentioned evidence that many joint replacements don’t do much good.

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, recommends that regular screenings begin at age 40, while the American Cancer Society calls for women to start yearly screening at age 45 and then move to screening every two years starting at age 55.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCongress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. Last month, in anticipation of Monday\'s release of the task force’s final recommendation, lawmakers took preemptive action: It directed insurers to ignore the task force\'s latest guidelines and, instead, to rely on its 2002 recommendation. That called for annual mammograms to begin at 40. As a result of the congressional action, women in their 40s will continue to be able to get annual mammograms at no cost.\n\nThe differences over when to start regular screening reflect the growing concern that the benefits of mammograms may have been oversold, and that they don\'t outweigh the anxiety and potential harm caused by over-diagnosis and false positives from the tests.\n\nThe debate over when to start regular screening involves only women of ""average risk"" who don\'t have specific risk factors for breast cancer such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations or a family history of the disease. They\'re also not aimed at diagnostic mammography, which takes place once a woman has a symptom such as a lump. The screening recommendations are not binding on doctors, hospitals or insurers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn releasing its final recommendations, the task force confirmed an earlier guidance it issued that said screening mammography had the greatest benefit for women ages 50 to 74. For women in their 40s, the likelihood of benefit is less and the potential harms are proportionally greater, it said. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman\'s health during her lifetime.\n\nThe congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts.\n\n“The U.S. Congress thinks it\'s perfectly acceptable, even preferred, for a scientific document from 14 years ago to guide coverage policy on screening for breast cancer in women,” says Kenneth Lin, a Georgetown University family medicine doctor who teaches preventive and evidence-based medicine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPart of the problem is the common perception that women deserve free mammogram coverage and that the scientific community is basing its decision on cost or rationing, said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on public health.\n\nFran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the task force\'s guidelines for women in their 40s — that they should discuss whether to get mammograms with their doctors and make individual decisions — come closest to following the evidence accumulated over the past three decades. Women should trust that process, she said.\n\nDespite the decades of marketing of mammography to women, ""women are capable of understanding the complexities of the issue, evaluating the evidence and making their own health decisions,"" she said in a statement.\n\n""At some point we will have to decide that we are not going to pay for interventions that lack a high level of medical evidence,"" she said. ""At this time, what does concern us very much are attempts by Congress to interfere with the makeup and process of the US Preventive Services Task Force.""\n\nThe task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which required that certain preventive services be provided for free — if those services got a strong recommendation from the task force. But it included an amendment that effectively directed insurers to use the 2002 recommendations for mammograms. That meant that women who were 40 and older could get mammograms at no cost.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn April 2015, the task force came out with its latest draft guidance, basically reaffirming its 2009 recommendations that the greatest benefit of mammography screening is for women between 50 and 74.\n\nWorried that millions of women under 50 could lose their free annual mammogram coverage if the guidelines became final, several health-care groups, including ACOG, the American College of Radiology and the Susan G. Komen Foundation, lobbied Congress to block that from happening.\n\nLanguage was included in the spending bill that says any recommendations of the task force related to breast cancer screening, mammography and prevention refers to those “issued before 2009.”\n\nAD\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) was among the lawmakers who pushed for the language to be included. In a statement, she said her number one priority was to ensure that women can get mammograms if they and their doctors decide it\'s the right thing to do. ""This means making sure that cost is not a deterrent to care,"" she said.\n\nAD\n\nSeveral groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations. This results in confusion and puts more than 22 million women at risk of losing of losing insurance coverage for mammograms.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD']",A very good report that lacked a few details found in ,"The story provides a good overview of new recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on when, and how often, women should receive mammograms to screen for breast cancer. The story summarizes the long-running debate over mammogram recommendations, particularly congressional action on the issue. The story also discusses the differing advice that various organizations provide on when women at average risk of breast cancer should begin mammogram screening, though the story would have been stronger if it had more fully explored both the benefits and potential harms associated with women starting mammogram screening early or having the tests more often (something that a competing New York Times story on the recommendations does well). The story also offers a good discussion of issues related to what the USPSTF recommendations may mean for insurance coverage of mammograms, though it does not tell readers how expensive mammograms may be without insurance.

The study, published this month in The Lancet Oncology, is the first to show a positive impact from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs on this disease.\n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer that represents about 90 percent of all malignant mesothelioma cases. It\'s primarily caused by the inhalation of asbestos, a fiber commonly found in some forms of insulation, vinyl floor tiles, and other material. Tumors form in the pleura, a thin membrane of cells that line the lungs and chest wall. Most patients survive less than a year. This poor prognosis is partially due to the fact that most patients are not diagnosed until they are already at a late stage of the disease. The standard first-line therapy treatment involves chemotherapy, and currently there is no approved second-line therapy.\n\n""There have been a lot of studies looking at different drugs, but researchers have not seen positive results,"" said the study\'s lead author Evan Alley, MD, PhD, chief of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Penn Presbyterian Hospital. ""But we\'ve found this new class of drugs, checkpoint inhibitors, seems to be more effective than what\'s been available in the past.""\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors are a class of drugs designed to free the body\'s immune system to fight back against cancer. Pembrolizumab, in particular, has been used to treat melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and in some cases, head and neck cancers.\n\nAlley and his team presented data from KEYNOTE-028, an ongoing trial involving 13 different research sites in six different countries all looking at the effect of pembrolizumab on patients with advanced malignancies, including malignant pleural mesothelioma. The study evaluated 25 patients with pleural mesothelioma, all of whom were over the age of 18 and had either already been treated with chemotherapy or were unable to receive it. Patients who had already received another checkpoint inhibitor were not included in the study.\n\nBeginning with the first enrollees two years ago, doctors gave each patient a dose of pembrolizumab every two weeks. The tumor reduced in size in 14 of those patients. On average, patients went about six months without their disease progressing, and overall survival was about 18 months. Fourteen patients passed away during the study, while four were still undergoing treatment as of the study\'s writing.\n\n""Most patients who receive a second-line therapy have a life expectancy of about six or seven months, so to have four patients still ongoing at two years is very encouraging,"" Alley said.\n\nThe most common side-effects reported were fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and dry mouth.\n\n""One great sign in this study is that none of the patients had to stop treatment because of side-effects,"" Alley said. ""Some had temporary stoppages, but they were able to continue. The drug appears to be well-tolerated.""\n\nThere are multiple studies going on right now to confirm these findings, which the authors note is a necessary step before the drug can become a standard second-line therapy. ""This study provides evidence that some patients can have long-term disease control with this drug, which we haven\'t seen before,"" Alley said. ""We need to better understand what we can do next to make immunotherapy more effective for more patients.""\n\nAlley said there are already plans for trials that will test combination therapies, which will utilize pembrolizumab in conjunction with other treatments. Those studies are expected to launch later this year, including two at Penn.\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded by Merck, which manufactures pembrolizumab. Alley has no personal financial relationship with Merck.\n\nPenn Medicine is one of the world\'s leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care. Penn Medicine consists of the Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (founded in 1765 as the nation\'s first medical school) and the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which together form a $5.3 billion enterprise.\n\nThe Perelman School of Medicine has been ranked among the top five medical schools in the United States for the past 18 years, according to U.S. News & World Report\'s survey of research-oriented medical schools. The School is consistently among the nation\'s top recipients of funding from the National Institutes of Health, with $373 million awarded in the 2015 fiscal year.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania Health System\'s patient care facilities include: The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center -- which are recognized as one of the nation\'s top ""Honor Roll"" hospitals by U.S. News & World Report -- Chester County Hospital; Lancaster General Health; Penn Wissahickon Hospice; and Pennsylvania Hospital -- the nation\'s first hospital, founded in 1751. Additional affiliated inpatient care facilities and services throughout the Philadelphia region include Chestnut Hill Hospital and Good Shepherd Penn Partners, a partnership between Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network and Penn Medicine.\n\nPenn Medicine is committed to improving lives and health through a variety of community-based programs and activities. In fiscal year 2015, Penn Medicine provided $253.3 million to benefit our community.']",We’ve seen it before: releases claim benefits and evidence based only on small safety trials — this time it’s an experimental drug for mesothelioma.,"This case series involving 25 patients looked at the effect of pembrolizumab on patients with pleural mesothelioma (a cancer that develops on the lining of the lungs) and found what appears to be an improved level of tolerance. By omitting many important details of the study, it’s very hard to determine what sort of advantage this treatment has over other existing treatments. Because this was a phase 1b safety trial, testing different doses for safety and side effects, it should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism until more carefully done controlled trials on effectiveness are completed.  
The release makes an effort to show some restraint in describing the study but it may not be enough to counteract the many references to “evidence” claimed here. The release also omits some significant financial conflicts of interests among the study co-authors.

(June 1, 2016) - A two-year, multi-center clinical study with 167 patients with class III-IV refractory angina randomized to low and high dose CD34+ cells or placebo has revealed that patients who received either a high or low dose of CD34 -- a member of a family of proteins that have an impact on vascular-associated tissue -- cells had a significant reduction in angina frequency over patients who received placebo. The patients, who were unresponsive to other treatments, were considered to have no other options (refractory).\n\nThe researchers used intramyocardial delivery into the ischemic zone after 3-D mapping to register both electrical and mechanical activities of the left ventricle.\n\nOutcomes from the ""ACT-34-CMI"" study, a two-year, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, will be published in an upcoming cardiac issue of Cell Transplantation.\n\n""There are an increasing number of patients with advanced coronary artery disease that are not amenable to surgical or percutaneous revascularization,"" said study co-author Dr. Timothy D. Henry of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute. ""These patients frequently have symptoms after having had standard therapies and are left with limited treatment options. Encouraging early clinical trials suggest that cell therapy is an attractive treatment option for these patients, especially trials in which subjects were transplanted with autologous (self-donated) CD34+ cells.""\n\nCD34+ cells drew the attention of researchers for possible therapeutic testing because recent studies pointed to the importance of CD34+ cell content in the bone marrow of patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease in predicting not only baseline, but also future exercise capacity.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the study demonstrated that CD34+ cells have the ability to restore the microcirculation and improve myocardial tissue perfusion. All of the 167 patients participating in the ACT34-CMI study saw significant improvement in both angina frequency and exercise at 12 months and a trend toward decreasing major cardiac events. There was also a reduction in angina in the placebo group at six months, but the effect was less prominent at 12 and 24 months, reported the researchers. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the time to first hospitalization in cell-treated patients, with a trend toward reduction in mortality as well.\n\n""The results of our study are even more provocative given that the outcomes represent the effect of a single treatment,"" wrote the researchers. ""Recent reports suggest that in patients with recurring symptoms, repeated cell administration may replicate the initial positive results.""\n\nThe researchers concluded that for ""no option"" patients with class III/IV angina refractory that was unresponsive to conventional medical therapy and who were not candidates for revascularization, injection of CD34+ cells resulted in persistent improvement in angina at two years post-treatment.\n\n###\n\nContact:\n\nTimothy D.

Telomeres gradually shorten as people age and eventually may disappear, leaving cells vulnerable to disease and death.\n\nTelomere Diagnostics, of Menlo Park, Calif., launched an $89 test last week. Users mail in a drop of blood and get back a calculation of their age in “TeloYears,” adjusted up or down depending on how they compare with the general population. The service also provides advice for improving diet, fitness, sleep and stress levels, which some small studies suggest may help telomeres regain length.\n\n“There’s a difference between knowing how old you are, and how well you are aging,” says Telomere Diagnostics chief executive Jason Shelton. “The age you are on the inside, on the cellular level, may be a better indicator.”\n\nStill, some top telomere scientists say such information amounts to little more than high-tech palm reading, in part because telomere length varies so widely in the general population that it isn’t clear what length is problematic.\n\n“We don’t yet know how to interpret these results. It might suggest there is something wrong when there isn’t,” says Carol Greider, director of molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who shared the 2009 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering how telomeres protect chromosomes.\n\nWhat Your Cells Can Tell You What are telomeres?\n\nTelomeres are stretches of DNA at the end of chromosomes that protect them from damage, but they gradually wear away each time cells divide. When telomeres become critically short, chromosomes can fuse together and malfunction, causing cells to die, which contributes to disease.\n\nHow do telomeres relate to aging?\n\nMany studies have linked diseases of aging with short telomeres, but it isn’t clear whether short telomeres are a sign of cellular age or help cause the process.\n\nCan this process be slowed?\n\nTelomere shortening is determined by heredity, environment and lifestyle choices. Some studies suggest that controlling inflammation, exercising, maintaining a healthy diet and weight and not smoking, can slow the rate of shortening. An enzyme called telomerase adds more length to telomeres, but it is mostly found in sperm, egg and stem cells and cancerous tumors. There is no evidence that telomerase supplements help.\n\nCan measuring my telomeres tell me how long I have to live?\n\nNo. Most people never reach the end of their telomeres, and some scientists say they have to be extremely short before they contribute to disease.\n\nFellow Nobel winner Elizabeth Blackburn, now president of the Salk Institute, co-founded the predecessor company to Telomere Diagnostics, but parted ways with it in 2013 and is no longer connected to the company. Dr. Blackburn declined to comment for this article.\n\nSince telomeres were discovered in the 1990s, hundreds of studies have suggested links between telomere length and heart disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and mental-health issues.\n\nA meta-analysis of 24 studies involving a total of 43,725 participants, including 8,400 with cardiovascular diseases, found that those in the bottom third of telomere length had a 50% greater risk of cardiovascular disease than those in the top third. The review was published in BMJ in 2014.\n\nWhile telomere length is largely influenced by genetics, environment and lifestyle choices can affect it, too. Studies suggest shorter telomeres are associated with lack of exercise, poor sleep and a diet high in refined carbohydrates, among other factors.\n\nNASA believes that lengthy space travel can also age people faster and is monitoring how the telomeres of astronauts and twin brothers Scott and Mark Kelly change over time. Scott spent nearly a year in space, orbiting Earth in the Space Station, about four times as long as Mark.\n\nNASA astronaut Scott Kelly, left, spent nearly a year in space, orbiting Earth in the Space Station. That was about four times as long as his identical twin, Mark Kelly, right.

An often cited clinical trial, published in the Lancet in 2013, followed 35 men with low-risk prostate cancer for five years. It found that the 10 men who followed a program of diet, activity, stress management and social support lengthened their telomeres by about 10% compared with the 25 who didn’t. The study was conducted by researchers at University of California, San Francisco, and the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute.\n\nCritics say the few controlled trials that show people can lengthen their telomeres are very small and the large observational studies that make up the bulk of the scientific literature on telomeres don’t demonstrate cause and effect. And while exercise, a healthy diet and stress reduction may lower the risk of death and disease, it hasn’t been shown that telomere length has anything to do with it, some researchers say.\n\nMuch of what is known about telomeres and disease comes from studying people who have inherited extremely short telomeres and are vulnerable to several specific conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, immune deficiency, loss of bone marrow and certain cancers. It is important for those people, who make up at most 10% of the population, to know if their telomeres are abnormally short because they should avoid certain treatments, says Mary Armanios, clinical director of the Telomere Center at Johns Hopkins.\n\n“For everyone else, based on what we know in 2016, telomere length is not relevant to disease risk,” Dr. Armanios says. “They have to be really, really short to cause disease and most people never get to that point as they age.”\n\nThe testing companies argue that the wealth of observational studies provides ample evidence that short telomeres are a risk factor for many diseases in the general population and that making healthy lifestyle changes can help telomeres regain length. Knowing your telomere length isn’t meant to diagnose a specific disease, they say. “It’s more like a check-engine light” on a car, an early indication that something is amiss, says Calvin Harley, chief scientific officer at Telomere Diagnostics, which recommends users take the test every six months to track their progress.\n\nOther testing companies also contend that shorter-than-average telomeres can be a warning sign of future health problems. Titanovo Inc., in Raleigh, N.C., uses cheek swabs for its $150 test. Life Length, based in Madrid, offers its test only through physicians, who it says can help patients understand what they are most at risk for. The test, which costs $395, measures all 92 telomeres in cell samples, rather than reporting averages, as Telomere Diagnostics does.\n\nStephen Matlin, Life Length’s chief executive, says tens of thousands of patients in the U.S., the U.K. and the Middle East have used the test. While it isn’t known if they have lengthened their telomeres, “we do see that people adopt major lifestyle changes to improve their health and fitness,” he says.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nElizabeth Blackburn parted ways with the predecessor company to Telomere Diagnostics Inc. in 2013.

It is often administered as a gel, patch, injection or implant (pellet). There is currently no oral form of testosterone therapy approved for use in the United States by the Federal Drug Agency; however researchers from Houston, TX and Torrance, CA have been evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of LPCN 1021, a novel oral testosterone undecanoate formulation for the treatment of low testosterone.\n\nThroughout a 52-week study period, a total of 315 hypogonadal men were randomized either to LPCN 1021 or T gel (active control). Of the 315 men, 210 were randomized to LPCN 1021 and 105 were randomized to active control. Following a 13-week efficacy phase, men continued to receive their assigned treatment for up to 52 weeks.

Not exercising and sitting all day is as dangerous as being obese or smoking, they found.\n\nAnd the added risk of parking yourself in front of a television for 5 hours or more a day after sitting at the office is so high even the hour of exercise is not enough to reverse the damage.\n\n""We cannot stress enough the importance of getting exercise, whether it\'s getting out for a walk at lunchtime, going for a run in the morning or cycling to work,"" said Ulf Ekelund of the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Norway, one of the study authors, in a statement.\n\nIt has been long suspected that sitting a lot, at work or at home, is not healthy. Previous studies have found that prolonged sitting can raise the chances of heart disease, various cancers and an earlier death.\n\nIn the new research , experts combed through 13 papers with data on factors including how long people spend sitting, their physical activity levels and their television-watching habits. The majority of studies included people older than age 45. All except one were done in the U.S., Western Europe and Australia.\n\nResearchers found that people with the highest levels of moderate physical activity — 60 to 75 minutes daily— erased the higher risk of death linked to being seated for more than eight hours a day. But even that exercise regime was not enough to counter the hazards of also watching more than five hours of television a day.\n\nThe paper was published online Wednesday in the journal Lancet.\n\nLars Bo Andersen, who co-authored an accompanying commentary, called the new research ""very convincing,"" explaining that too much sitting increases the risk of problems including diabetes and heart disease because it can make insulin levels spike and might slow the body\'s metabolism.\n\nAndersen said that watching lots of television was probably even worse than sitting at the office all day because it likely includes other unhealthy habits.\n\n""A lot of people don\'t just watch TV, they eat fatty snacks at the same time,"" said Andersen, of Sogn and Fjordane University College in Norway.\n\nAndersen said that some cultures make it easier than others to squeeze in an hour of exercise every day, noting that in Denmark and much of Scandinavia, about half of all people either cycle or walk to work. But he said that getting the recommended amount of physical activity shouldn\'t be overly arduous and doesn\'t necessarily mean going to the gym for an intense work-out.\n\n""If you are walking and can feel yourself getting a little warm and your breathing is a little heavier, that\'s enough,"" he said. ""You don\'t have to be sweaty and out of breath to get the benefits.""']",The research at hand couldn’t prove one way or another if exercise can counteract sitting all day–and the story should have made that clearer.,"This story reports on a large meta-analysis of observational studies looking at the association between sedentary behavior (sitting and TV-watching), exercise, and risk of dying prematurely.
Its main take-home message is “it takes about 60 to 75 minutes of ‘moderate intensity’ exercise to undo the damage of sitting for at least eight hours a day.” Although that’s a faithful account of how the study researchers frame their results, we think it’s likely to leave readers with a misleading impression.
Despite what the researchers may claim, this type of study can’t prove that exercise can “undo the damage of sitting” — all it can do is show associations between these behaviors and risk of death. There are many factors, other than exercise and sedentary behavior, that affect one’s risk of death (e.g. diet, illnesses, socioeconomic factors), and the story didn’t explain that researchers can’t account for all of those factors in a study like this. Suggesting that exercise “reverses” the damage of sitting implies a certainty to the study’s conclusions that simply doesn’t exist.

On average, patients were followed for a year although some were followed for about three and a half years. The risk of infection was reduced 63% overall, but for participants who actually got the drugs, that risk decreased by 78%.\n\nGiving daily antiretroviral drugs to uninfected individuals to prevent the disease is called pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP. Previous studies have shown PrEP to be effective in reducing infection rates among the uninfected.\n\nDr. Kevin Fenton, director of the CDC\'s national Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, called the news a milestone. ""It is clear we are not going to find one magic pill to solve the issue of HIV but by combining this approach with others we are beginning to get a better handle on combination packages. There is reason to be excited.""\n\nThe news comes at the same time a second study looking at PrEP in heterosexual couples in Kenya and Uganda also found significant reductions in infection rates. The Partners PrEP study participants took either TDF/FTC, the drug tenofovir–brand name Viread, or a placebo. Preliminary results showed both treatments significantly reduced transmission in couples where one partner was already infected with the virus. Patients who took tenofovir had 62% fewer infections while those taking the combination drug had 73% fewer infections than those who got the placebo.\n\n""Just a few years ago the tool kit for HIV prevention was not very large,"" says Dr. Jared Baeten, the principal investigator of the Partners PrEP study at the University of Washington. ""Now we have a nice collection of really powerful strategies that work for the population at greatest risk in the world. This is really a game changer.""\n\n""We now have findings from two studies showing that PrEP can work for heterosexuals, the population hardest hit by HIV worldwide,"" Fenton said. ""Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence the power of this prevention strategy.""\n\nIn fact, an interim review of the Partners data on effectiveness was so compelling that the trial was stopped early and the placebo arm was discontinued. Clear evidence Baeten said, that PrEP substantially reduces infection risk. At the same time he says, there was no evidence of safety concerns. Patients taking the placebo will be put on one of the drugs.\n\nIn the TDF2 study those taking the drug reported nausea, vomiting and dizziness.\n\nAn earlier PrEP trial, the iPrEx study, looked at treatment in men who have sex with men. Infection rates dropped by 90% in patients who consistently used PrEP.\n\n“We are in a critical moment in HIV prevention research,” said Robert Grant, M.D., M.P.H, of the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California at San Francisco. He is the iPrEx protocol chair. “iPrEx provided the first proof of an important new method of HIV prevention that can help slow the global toll of 2.6 million new HIV infections each year. Partners PrEP and the TDF2 study have now expanded that finding by demonstrating the effectiveness of PrEP in heterosexual women and men.\n\n""Developing and deploying proven HIV prevention methods – including PrEP, microbicides, vaginal gels, clean needles, medical male circumcision, early treatment, counseling, testing, condoms and suppressive therapy for pregnant women will all be key to slowing the global epidemic,"" he said.\n\nThe CDC says the next step is to fully review all the data and begin to develop guidelines for the use of these drugs in heterosexual men and women here in the U.S.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Although we believe the <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=4116"" target=""_blank"">competing AP story</a> did a slightly better job overall, this story had the edge when it came to discussion of potential harms and alternative approaches.</span>","This CNN story on two new studies of antiretroviral drugs for HIV prevention could have been improved. The cost of these drugs, whether in Africa or the United States, is a major issue that affects their viability as a prevention tool — a fact which the story didn’t touch on. And while the story suggests that the studies only involved medication, both included other interventions. According to a University of Washington press release, “All study participants received a comprehensive package of HIV prevention services, which included intensive safer sex counseling (both individually and as a couple), HIV testing, free condoms, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, and monitoring and care for HIV infection.” These additional interventions are not routinely available and may have contributed to the studies results; an important consideration when considering an implementation strategy.

As an alternative, many people try to do what they can to strengthen their immune systems. Vitamin C is old news, and echinacea and other herbs haven’t really panned out. But there’s a livelier option: probiotic supplements that supposedly fortify the immune system.\n\nEach capsule of Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity from ReNew Life Formulas Inc. of Clearwater, Fla., contains 10 billion cultures of the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. Users are instructed to take two capsules a day with a light meal. A bottle of 30 capsules, sold at Whole Foods and many other health food stores, costs about $30.\n\nA capsule of Probiotic Immunity from New Chapter Inc., based in Brattleboro, Vt., contains 1 billion each of 10 different organisms, including Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus, two species of bacteria often found in yogurt. Other ingredients include herbs such as cumin, ginger and spinach. Users are instructed to take two capsules each day, preferably one in the morning and one in the evening, on an empty stomach. You can buy a bottle of 90 capsules for about $20 at many health food stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims\n\nThe website for Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity says that it “provides seasonal immune support” and “enhances respiratory health and immunity.” Put together, the statements seem to imply the product improves immunity against seasonal respiratory infections. But senior vice president of marketing Brian Colin says that the company cannot legally claim to prevent or treat any disease, including the cold and flu. Instead, he says that Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity can “promote overall immune health.”\n\nThe website for Probiotic Immunity says that the product “helps promote optimal digestive and immune system function.” A brochure provided by the company said that the supplement offers “live probiotics for optimal immune health.” As with Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity, users are left to themselves to speculate exactly which illnesses their newly optimal immune system might be fighting off.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt may seem odd, but there’s no doubt that a capsule full of live yeast or bacteria could help stimulate the immune system and potentially ward off illness, says Paul Forsythe, a respiratory specialist and assistant professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nBut, as Forsythe noted in an April 2011 issue of the journal Chest, most of the research on probiotics has been conducted in mice, and the real-world immunity benefits for humans are uncertain. Companies “are taking evidence from animal studies and stretching their claims,” he says.\n\nStill, Forsythe sees some room for hope that the right probiotic could make the cold and flu season a little less miserable. “There is some evidence that certain strains [of probiotics] can reduce the severity and duration of a cold.”\n\nA September 2011 Cochrane Review of 14 studies found “weak” evidence that probiotics could help prevent the common cold and other upper respiratory infections in infants, children and younger adults. And an April 2011 study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found a Lactobacillus probiotic seemed to improve the immune system’s response following a flu vaccination.\n\nDr. Sonia Michail, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, says the basic idea behind so-called immunity-boosting probiotics makes sense. As she explains, the gut is a major front in the immune system’s war against pathogens, and the immune cells there must respond to the resident bacteria. If helpful bacteria can activate immune cells in the gut, the disease fighters will spread throughout the body.\n\nBut according to Michail, studies suggest that, for unknown reasons, only some people — perhaps as few as 1 in 30 — could hope to avoid a cold by taking probiotics. And, she adds, the evidence for even this modest benefit “is far from robust.”\n\nForsythe says that probiotics are generally safe and might be worth a try, if only for the extra peace of mind. He adds that if he were going to try a product, he’d choose one with only a single strain.\n\nOne other thing: “I wouldn’t waste my money on anything expensive,” he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhealth@latimes.com\n\nRead more at latimes.com/skeptic.']",The Healthy Skeptic column does its usual fine job evaluating claims – this time about probiotic products.,"The marketing message of “improving overall immune health” deserves to be scrutinized whenever and wherever it appears.

Her husband, Roger McDaniel, was a former chief executive of two companies involved in semiconductor manufacturing, and the family could afford the approximately $49,000 that the search would cost. They had expected to pay much more, but to their astonishment, Mrs. McDaniel’s insurance company covered almost all the drug costs. And the scientists who did the data analysis did not charge.\n\nFrom the start, the family knew the odds were against Mrs. McDaniel, but she thought she had little to lose.\n\n“You cannot feel bad if this doesn’t work or I die,” she told her son Timothy, a molecular biologist. “I would have died anyway.”\n\nScarlet Skin and Infections\n\nBeth McDaniel’s cancer began with itching all over her body. Then her skin turned scarlet and started becoming infected.\n\nIn 2005, after she had spent more than a year going from specialist to specialist, a dermatologist figured it out. Mrs. McDaniel, then 62, had Sezary syndrome, a rare T cell lymphoma, in which white blood cells become cancerous and migrate to the skin. All her doctors could tell her was that the disease was incurable, that there was no standard treatment, and that on average patients at her stage die within a few years.\n\n“Of course I was shocked,” Mrs. McDaniel said in an interview last September.\n\nShe wept that day as her husband drove her home. And she asked God to help her cope.\n\nBefore cancer, she had had a vibrant life, hiking in the mountains, traveling the world, entertaining her wide network of friends. Her disease destroyed all of that. She could not even enjoy her luxuriant garden because sun on her inflamed skin was agony.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough there is no standard treatment, for five years chemotherapy held her disease at bay. But in the summer of 2010, she got worse, much worse, with hundreds of tumors popping up under her skin. Some grew as large as kiwi fruits and split open.\n\nHer son, Dr. McDaniel, decided he would orchestrate the use of the most advanced techniques of gene sequencing and analysis to take on her cancer. Because of his job — he works for Illumina , a company that does DNA sequencing — Dr. McDaniel had read scientific reports and gone to medical conferences where he heard talks on whole genome sequencing. He noticed that the patients all seemed to have rare cancers.\n\n“Every time I heard one of those stories, I thought, ‘That’s my mom,’ ” he said.\n\nFor now, there are not many drugs that can target specific gene mutations in cancer cells.\n\nBut the hope is that when more is known and more drugs are developed, doctors will treat cancer by blocking several major genes at once. With several escape routes barred, the cancer will not be able to break free of the drugs stopping its growth.\n\nFull-Time Help From a Son\n\nIn theory, it seemed straightforward for Dr. McDaniel to help his mother. The technology for getting and analyzing DNA sequences has advanced greatly, and the cost has plummeted. In fact, Dr. McDaniel said, the price of sequencing has dropped so fast that if the work were done today, it would cost just $26,200 instead of the $46,280 it cost last year.\n\nThe first obstacle was just getting a sample of Mrs. McDaniel’s cancer cells. One doctor told her the odds of success were so slim that she would be better off spending her money on a vacation. Another seemed interested but did not follow through. A third did two biopsies but was unable to get usable DNA.\n\nFinally, Dr. McDaniel and his wife, Gia, decided he would make helping his mother a full-time job. He took a leave of absence from Illumina, and he, Gia and their three young children moved from San Diego to Lexington, Ky.\n\n“I have not been a particularly humble person,” Beth McDaniel said. “That humbled me.”\n\nDr. McDaniel’s parents had two homes in the Lexington area. One, on a horse farm, was vacant, and he appropriated a bedroom on the second floor for his office. He treated his work like a regular job, driving to the office each day from another house where he and his family were living. He dressed in his normal work clothes, slacks and a collared shirt. Meanwhile, his mother’s cancer was erupting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“She was covered in tumors, almost like cobblestones,” said Dr. Fernando R. de Castro, her dermatologist. “They felt like marbles and pebbles all over her skin.” Large ones on her arms and legs had burst open. “We started talking about hospice .”\n\nMrs. McDaniel said she was not a vain person, but with red lumps all over her face, she was embarrassed to go out. She slept on a cooling pad and carried one with her to relieve the constant itching.\n\nEvery evening around 5:30 when the itching became most unbearable, she would lay her head in her husband’s lap as they watched TV in their great room and he would gently tickle her back for hours on end — trying to ease her discomfort.\n\nThe disease continued a relentless course until finally, accepting what seemed the inevitable, Mrs. McDaniel gave away her clothes, planned her funeral and wrote notes to a few people she thought she had offended in her life, asking them to forgive her.\n\n“She believed, we all believed, she would die before we got the sequencing done,” Dr. McDaniel said.\n\nThen, in January 2011, Dr. de Castro got a tissue sample from a tumor and, for comparison with normal cells, her saliva. He had removed a plug of tissue the size of a pencil eraser from one of the hundreds of tumors on Mrs. McDaniel’s skin, frozen it in liquid nitrogen and shipped it overnight to the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale , Ariz. By April, scientists at Illumina and TGen, a nonprofit research institute, had completed the genetic sequencing of the samples.\n\nPhoto\n\nNext came the hard part — the analysis. With time short, Dr. McDaniel worked on it himself and recruited two small biotechnology companies and TGen to help.\n\nThree Billion Symbols in a Cell\n\nJohn Carpten, an oncologist at TGen, and David Craig are accustomed to working with gene sequence data, but it is hard even for them to get used to the scale of such a project.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It took a full day just to pull this terabyte of information off the drive. Dr. Carpten explained that there were three billion symbols, made from four letters — A, T, G and C — in just one cell’s DNA. If those letters were printed on paper, they would fill a medium-sized elementary school’s library.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there are unavoidable errors in sequencing, so to be sure the data is correct, researchers repeat the sequencing 30 times — 30 libraries’ worth. They do this for the normal cells, too — another 30 libraries’ worth. This kind of data, though, does not come in neat genetic words and sentences. Instead, Dr. Craig said, “It looks like it’s been through a shredder.”\n\n“It is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle that has a billion pieces,” Dr. Carpten said.\n\nFinally, they compared the sequences of normal cells and cancer cells. They found about 18,000 differences, most with no known significance for the disease.\n\nAt last, the work was done, and on May 18, Dr. McDaniel flew to TGen. The researchers noticed an intriguing aberration in Mrs. McDaniel’s cancer genes. But they were uncertain what it meant.\n\nIt looked as if two genes had fused to each other in Mrs. McDaniel’s cancer cells. The result was that the cell growth signals in the cancer cells were reversed, like crossed wires. The research team theorized that every time those cancer cells, T cells of her immune system, got a signal to stop growing, they reacted as though they had gotten a signal to grow. And every time they got a signal to grow, they responded by stopping their growth.\n\nIf they were right, the way to stop her cancer’s growth could be to signal it to grow. And that was what a new melanoma drug — ipilimumab, its trade name Yervoy — was designed to do. It spurred the growth of normal T cells.\n\nBut if the researchers were wrong, the drug could kill her.\n\nThey spent two hours at a whiteboard on Wednesday, May 18, trying to understand what the fusion really meant. Then Dr. McDaniel took the data home and asked a colleague at Illumina to try to fish out a handful of crucial genetic sequences that were buried among 50 million others. On Sunday night, May 22, Dr. McDaniel had them and began trying to decipher them. By 10 p.m., he had it figured out. The TGen scientists’ findings were real.\n\n“The brake pedal had been wired to the accelerator,” Dr. McDaniel said.\n\nHe worked all night, found a paper by scientists who had deliberately fused those very genes and discovered that, yes, the genetically altered T cells had their growth signals reversed.\n\nAt 5:45 a.m. Dr. McDaniel sent an e-mail to his collaborators.\n\n“I was so tired at that point that, believe it or not, I had forgotten about the drug,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe fell asleep and woke at 11 a.m., rushing back to his computer. The melanoma drug he had forgotten in his exhaustion should hit that target. And that could stop his mother’s cancer from growing. “My jaw was just hanging open,” Dr. McDaniel said. “The implications were so tantalizing that I didn’t dare believe them.”\n\nA Remarkable Turnaround\n\nMrs. McDaniel had her first infusion on July 28, and the result seemed remarkable. Her oncologist, Dr. Gohmann, was overwhelmed. Her son, who had been terrified that he and the doctors might have made a terrible mistake, was overjoyed.\n\nMrs. McDaniel, who had not left her house for several months except to see her doctors, began going to movies and restaurants every day.\n\nOn Sept. 2, she and her husband went to the Heirloom Restaurant, in the middle of horse country, to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nShe had given away so many of her clothes when she thought she was dying that she puzzled over what to wear. She had a favorite blouse that was loosefitting and comfortable, but Mr. McDaniel recalled, “It was long gone.” She could not drink wine with the medicines she was taking, so she and her husband sipped iced tea in the quiet dining room.\n\n“We reminisced, but also talked about the future as we hoped it would be,” Mr. McDaniel said.\n\nBut the reprieve lasted only weeks. By the end of September, the cancer was back.\n\nDr. McDaniel did not want to give up. Mrs. McDaniel’s tumor was sequenced again, looking for a new mutation, but there was nothing striking. As Dr. McDaniel sifted through the data, he called his parents every day. They began calling him the governor, hoping he would bring his mother another stay of execution.\n\nThe doctors considered a less appealing target, a mutated gene that T cells use to stop growing. Unpublished studies in mice suggested that a kidney cancer drug might stop the growth of T cells with this mutation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy then, Mrs. McDaniel’s body was ravaged by the cancer and her treatments. She had entered hospice care, with a hospital bed in her home and a nurse and an assistant to help.\n\n“We had this shaky evidence, based on the genome and on unpublished data,” Dr. McDaniel said.\n\nBut the drug’s side effects were mild, and her family and doctors decided she should try it.\n\n“If we do nothing, she will be dead in one to six weeks,” Dr. McDaniel explained.\n\nMrs. McDaniel took the drug on Nov. 26. But she was so ill that she was unable to get out of bed, unable to drink from a straw. Her son Tim took his children to her bedroom one at a time so they could say goodbye.\n\n“She wasn’t talking, but her eyes were open, and she acknowledged each one with a weak chuckle,” Dr. McDaniel said.\n\nThree days later, she briefly rallied. Her husband held her hand.\n\n“She said, ‘I love you,’ ” Mr. McDaniel said. “She then repeated it twice more. I kissed her forehead and told her that I loved her. Those were our last words to each other.”\n\nThe next morning, Nov. 30, Mr. McDaniel woke early and went to his wife’s room. Her breathing had become erratic. Worried, he stepped out and asked the hospice nurse to call the doctor. “In the seconds that I was absent, she died,” Mr. McDaniel said.\n\nThe team that tried to save her was heartbroken too, and was left with a long list of what-ifs. “If you really look at it, what did we buy her?” Dr. de Castro asked. Mrs. McDaniel was dying last January. Yet would she have survived as long even without the sequencing or the drugs? Did the team make a difference?\n\n“I hope we did,” Dr. de Castro said, “but it’s hard to know.”.\n\nTuesday: What a tumor holds in store.""]","This thoughtful, carefully worded story explains exploratory cancer research with all the caveats intact. (Part of a series.)","This moving story about one son’s quest to cure his mother’s cancer manages to explain to readers quite a lot about the broader issue of the limitations of genome sequencing, the difficulty in pinpointing the cause for certain cancers, and, perhaps most importantly, the difficult emotional terrain traversed by patients and clinicians out on the frontiers of medical research.

The medicine group\'s scores on an important behavior measure were just as good as a control group of 4-year-olds born on time at a normal weight.\n\nThe results are ""super exciting,"" said Dr. Robin Ohls, the lead author and a pediatrics professor at the University of New Mexico. She said it\'s the first evidence of long-term benefits of the drugs when compared to no blood-boosting treatment.\n\nEven though the treated youngsters didn\'t do as well as the normal-weight group on most measures, their scores were impressive and suggest greater brain development than the other preemies, Ohls said.\n\nThey scored about 12 points higher on average on IQ tests than the untreated kids but about 10 points lower than the normal-weight group. On tests measuring memory and impulsive behavior, the treated kids fared as well as those born at normal weight.\n\nHere\'s how those differences would show up in a preschool setting: The untreated group would be the kids who struggle a little in class, while the those who got the medicines would do OK but not as well as those born at a normal weight, said Dr. Michael Schreiber, a prematurity expert at the University of Chicago\'s Comer Children\'s Hospital.\n\nSurvival of extremely tiny preemies has improved dramatically in the past 50 years, but treatment for medical problems and developmental delays linked with prematurity has not kept pace, Schreiber said. He was not involved in the study.\n\nHe said larger studies including more diverse patient populations are needed to determine if the drugs can help a broader range of preemies.\n\nThe study involved 53 children, most white or Hispanic, born more than a month premature and weighing less than 3 pounds at hospitals in New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Two dozen normal-weight children were also included.\n\nResults were published Monday in Pediatrics.\n\nShortly after birth the preemies were randomly assigned to receive injections of either erythropoeitin (EPO), three times weekly; darbepoetin once a week for several weeks; or no treatment. The drugs build red blood cells and are approved to treat anemia caused by cancer treatment or resulting from other conditions.\n\nPreemies lack the ability to make new red blood cells and often need frequent blood transfusions to replace blood taken for lab tests. The drugs are now sometimes used to try to reduce their need for transfusions, in doses similar to the ones studied.\n\nThe drugs can increase endurance by boosting oxygen levels in the blood, and have been implicated in some sports doping scandals.\n\nDr. Sandra Juul, a University of Washington pediatrics professor, is leading a larger multi-center study of both drugs in preemies and said it\'s too soon to recommend the medicines for treating developmental delays.\n\nStill, since almost half of infants born extremely early have significant developmental problems, any treatment that could improve their lives ""is incredibly important,"" Juul said.\n\n———\n\nPediatrics: http://www.pediatrics.org\n\nPrematurity: http://tinyurl.com/pc8chdd\n\n———\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at http://www.twitter.com/LindseyTanner .

The findings suggest a possible intervention for obesity, when combined with healthy eating and exercise. Results were published in Obesity concurrent with a presentation at the 2015 Obesity Society meeting.\n\nLed by scientists at the Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch, part of NIH’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the team studied a total of nine men and women with obesity who resided in the Branch’s metabolic ward on two separate visits, each for eight days. On each visit, the participants ate a weight-maintaining diet for five days. Then for three days, they unknowingly received either active or sham (fake) transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. Participants then ate and drank as much as they wanted from computerized vending machines. Applied to the scalp, the active tDCS targeted the brain region controlling behavior and reward.\n\nThe four people who got the sham stimulation during both visits consumed the same number of calories from the vending machines on each visit and did not lose weight. But the five people who got inactive stimulation on the first visit, and active tDCS at the brain target on the second visit, consumed an average of 700 fewer calories and lost an average of 0.8 pounds on the second visit.\n\nNext, the researchers will compare a group getting only active tDCS with a separate group getting only sham stimulation.

The discovery could greatly expand the window for diagnosing concussions, especially in patients who experience a delayed onset of symptoms.\n\n""Symptoms of a concussion, or a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, can be subtle and are often delayed, in many cases by several days,"" said Linda Papa, MD, MSC, an emergency medicine physician and NIH funded researcher at Orlando Health and lead author of the study. ""This could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly.""\n\nIt\'s estimated nearly a quarter of a million children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports, an average of nearly 700 a day. Almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or loss of balance, or symptoms reported by the child, like blurred vision or headaches. Neither scenario gives doctors and objective way to determine the severity of the injury.\n\n""If patients are not diagnosed properly and treated appropriately, it could lead to long-term problems,"" said Papa. Untreated, or under-treated traumatic brain injuries like concussions, can lead to prolonged bouts with headaches, dizziness, memory loss and depression.\n\n""This test could take the guesswork out of making a diagnosis by allowing doctors to simply look for a specific biomarker in the blood.""\n\nThe biomarker Papa analyzed is known as a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain, and when an injury occurs, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, making them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\n""Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,"" said Papa.\n\nResearchers analyzed nearly 600 patients for 3 years. When cross-checked with scans, the blood test was able to detect mild to moderate traumatic brain lesions with up to 97 percent accuracy in patients 18 years and older. The blood test also indicated which patients were in need of life-saving neurosurgery. This suggests that the blood test could be used by clinicians for up to a week after injury to detect brain injury. This is important because many patients with concussion may not seek medical attention for days after injury.\n\nThe blood test could also dramatically cut down on the need for computerized tomography (CT) scans. Currently, CT scans are the most precise way to diagnose brain lesions, but are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure. ""Physicians really want to minimize the amount of CTs in patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it. Fortunately, this simple blood test appears to give us nearly the same information as a CT scan.""\n\nIn fact, in a previous study published last fall, Papa and her team at Orlando Health tested both. They analyzed 152 children within 6 hours of sustaining a concussion, or mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The results showed that the blood test was able to detect brain injuries with 94 percent accuracy, nearly as effective as state-of-the art CT scans.\n\n""This could ultimately change the way we diagnose concussions, not only in children, but in anyone who sustains a head injury,"" said Papa. ""We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there\'s never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. We think this test could change that,"" she said.\n\n###\n\nB-ROLL, SOUND BITES, WEB ELEMENTS & HI-RES STILL PHOTOS - Including HD video available for free/unrestricted use by the news media: http://bit. ly/ 1RzO1As\n\nCourtesy: Orlando Health\n\nFor assistance in downloading, or if you have any questions, contact: drew@mediasourcetv.com or call: 614.932.9950\n\nAbout Orlando Health\n\nOrlando Health is a $2.1 billion not-for-profit health care organization and a community-based network of physician practices, hospitals, and outpatient care centers throughout Central Florida.

This has long been used as a folk remedy for skin lesions.\n\nThe new findings are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nActinic keratoses are typically red, scaly skin lesions that can over time develop into a type of skin cancer. They can often be found on sun-exposed areas of the body such as the face, scalp, arms, and legs.\n\nThe new gel, Picato (ingenol mebutate), is applied once daily for two or three days, depending on the area being treated. Other available topical treatments must be used for several weeks, and often irritate the skin. Cryotherapy, or freezing the affected skin area, is also used but can sometimes leave a scar.\n\nBecause the new gel is only used for a few days, any irritation is usually short-lived. The short duration also makes people more likely to stay the course, another advantage, according to the study's authors.\n\n“The shorter application period is what makes ingenol mebutate a breakthrough in the treatment of actinic keratosis,” researcher Mark Lebwohl, MD, says in a news release. He is a professor and chair of the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.\n\nThe new study included 547 people with actinic keratoses on their face or scalp and 458 people with these lesions on their mid-section or arms and legs.

A Closer Look\n\nNone of the stem cells will be injected into patients; instead, they are grown into another kind of cell that will be delivered to the back of the eye, where the retina is damaged by the disease. The hope is that the cells will help repair the damaged retinal tissue.\n\nAbout 10 million Americans suffer some degree of vision loss caused by age-related macular degeneration, and that figure is expected to grow as more baby boomers become senior citizens. There is no cure for the disease, but last week the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave a green light to an unusual clinical trial that seeks to restore patients\' sight by employing human embryonic stem cells.\n\nThe company behind the trial, Santa Monica-based Advanced Cell Technology Inc., developed the therapy to treat Stargardt\'s macular dystrophy, a rare childhood version of macular degeneration that affects about 1 in 10,000 kids. The FDA gave the company permission to test the therapy in Stargardt\'s patients in November. However, if they work, the cells would have a much bigger effect as a treatment for age-related macular degeneration.\n\nHere\'s a closer look at the disease and the new therapy.\n\nWhat is age-related macular degeneration?\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among people who are 65 and older, says Dr. Jose Pulido, an ophthalmologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The dry version of the disease begins with tiny deposits of fat and protein — called drusen — that appear in the center of the retina, called the macula. As the deposits grow in number and size over the course of years, things begin to look blurry in the center of a person\'s field of vision. As the disease worsens, the blurriness may progress to a blind spot.\n\nWhat causes it?\n\nThe main problem is that light-sensing cells in the macula, called photoreceptors, slowly break down. This is thought to be caused by the loss of another population of cells, called retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which support the photoreceptors in a number of ways.\n\nAmong other things, the RPE cells release growth factors important for photoreceptors to thrive. ""The RPE are also the garbage trucks of the retina,"" removing toxic byproducts that the retina makes as it performs its light-sensing function, says Stephen Rose, chief research officer for the Foundation Fighting Blindness, a fundraising organization based in Columbia, Md.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A well-written and interesting story.  But see our reviewers’ concerns about how the stage of the research was framed, including projection of benefits not yet known, no discussion of potential harms, and unclear discussion of who might benefit. </span>","It’s a tough thing for a reporter to write about a study that hasn’t been conducted yet. Without any actual data to work with, the temptation is talk too much about what the researchers hope they will find in the study; discussion of harms and other caveats often gets overwhelmed by this optimistic speculation. The story we review here didn’t succumb to the worst excesses that these kinds of reports are subject to, and it did some things very well. For example, when discussing the new treatment that’s set to be studied — an embryonic stem cell therapy for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) — it gave some interesting and detailed background on how AMD develops and how the new treatment might work. But in the end, we thought the discussion of hypothetical benefits was out of balance considering the very early stage of the research, and there was no mention of potential costs or harms. The story also didn’t explain carefully enough who might be a candidate for this treatment, should it eventually make it to market.

This was achieved by assessing the DNA of 80,000 prostate cancer patients and 61,000 men without the disease.\n\nThe resulting test hones in on these and the existing 100 known markers to pinpoint the 1 percent of men who are at six times greater risk of developing the condition, and the 10 percent of men who have a threefold greater risk of developing the disease, a study author told The Guardian.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe new method is being trialed on 300 men in doctor surgeries across London, and is due to be expanded to 5,000 next year, according to BBC News.\n\nIf it is found to be effective, it could be an important tool for physicians. Although prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. after lung, few risk factors have been found, and it is difficult to accurately diagnose.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nMost men with prostate cancer do not experience symptoms. Doctors can use the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test to detect protein produced by prostate and cancerous cells, respectively. But as these antigens can be present in men without the cancer, it carries a risk of returning a false positive that can kick-start unnecessary, life-changing treatment. Rectal examinations and biopsies are also used to test for the disease.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, over 160,600 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed each year, and around 29,400 people die of the disease. The condition is rare in those below the age of 40; older men and African-Americans are most at risk. The majority of cases are caught at around 66.\n\nRosalind Eeles, an author of the study at the U.K.-based Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) who specializes in finding genetic variants that increase the risk of prostate cancer, told The Guardian the team is “excited by the test” because it can be used by doctors to offer patients targeted screenings.\n\nCarl Alexander, a spokesman from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: “This study is an exciting example of how research can find clues in our genes to help us uncover those more likely to develop the disease. The next steps should be to understand how this research can be developed into tests that could identify men who might be more likely to develop aggressive cancers, and how this could be rolled out to patients.”\n\nDr. Iain Frame, the director of research at the charity Prostate Cancer UK, highlighted that men with a family history of prostate cancer are two-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with the disease compared to a man with no family history.\n\n""With Father’s Day fast approaching, use it as an opportunity to ask your dad, your brother, your uncle, your friends about their risk of prostate cancer. It’s a conversation that could save their life,"" he said.']",This is an oversight we see often in news stories reporting on research about new cancer screening tests.,"Getty Images
This story reported on a saliva test to identify men who are at greatest risk of developing prostate cancer. The test was developed from a DNA study that identified previously unknown genetic variants common in men who had the disease. The story provided prostate cancer incidence and explained pitfalls of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood tests, which have been used to screen for prostate cancer. But it misses important caveats and contains little original reporting.
A key detail the story should have included? Researchers identified genetic markers in men who were already known to have prostate cancer. They have yet to show that testing for these markers helps identify which men without prostate cancer will go on to develop it. This is an oversight we see often in news stories reporting on research about new cancer screening tests.

The study looks at adults with chronic low back pain, one of the leading cause of disabilities in the United States and one reason why more and more people are addicted to painkillers.\n\nAD\n\nLed by Daniel C. Cherkin of Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, the experiment involved randomly assigning 342 adults with the condition to meditate, talk with a psychologist or continue with their normal techniques for addressing the pain, such as medication. The first group engaged in yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which focuses on being aware of and accepting physical discomfort. The second group participated in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to change pain-related thoughts and behaviors during eight weekly two-hour group sessions.\n\nAD\n\nThe participants in the small study ranged in age from 20 to 70 and had suffered from back pain for an average of 7.3 years.\n\nThe results for both techniques were very positive.

But if the beta-amyloid plaques that are the disorder’s key physical hallmark could be detected before memory loss and cognitive troubles were evident to all, would you want to know? And since no treatment currently works to stem the inexorable progress ofAlzheimer’s, who would pay for a costly test to detect it early -- and why?\n\nThose questions are no longer hypothetical. Last week, the FDA approved an agent called Florbetapir F 18 injection (to be marketed as Amyvid), which will allow physicians using a positron emissions tomography (PET) scan to detect the presence and extent of amyloid plaques in patients concerned about declining mental function.\n\nAnd on Monday, the American Academy of Neurology released a new study showing that an agent called florbetaben also allowed detection of amyloid plaques when used with a PET scan. The florbetaben study is to be presented at the academy’s “Emerging Science” program next week in New Orleans. Both Florbetapir F 18 and florbetaben help diagnose Alzheimer’s by sticking to beta amyloid clumps and emitting radioactivity, which can then be picked up by a PET scan.\n\nUntil recently, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease could be made only after a patient’s death, when a pathologist could find physical evidence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A brain biopsy now can be used to detect Alzheimer’s plaques but is highly invasive and may miss parts of the brain where the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer’s are densest. While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection, accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FDA says that Amyvid “is not a test to predict the development of AD-associated dementia” in those who have no problematic symptoms. It’s an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer’s disease may be the cause. Among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, about 60% have amyloid plaques and will go on to develop dementia that is likely Alzheimer’s disease, said Dr. Michael W. Weiner of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases.\n\nWeiner is the leading researcher on the largest and most comprehensive Alzheimer’s research initiative of its kind, the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. ADNI, a nationwide consortium that is still enrolling subjects, is a five-year, $60-million project that will track 800 participants to compare how mental and daily-life skills, and the brain’s structure and function, change in those aging normally, those with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia. Weiner conducted much of the research leading to Amyvid’s approval.\n\nFor now, says Weiner, there is “no consensus” on which patients should get the costly new PET scans that use Amyvid, and large insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid have not made decisions about coverage for such tests. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer’s disease, said Weiner.\n\n“But for many, when you take a person to the doctor, you usually want an answer, whether it leads to a treatment or not. This is a way of getting closer to an answer,” said Weiner. Many patients experiencing cognitive lapses may also be reassured if the test fails to reveal amyloid plaques, he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer’s disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The “real game-changer,” he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer’s disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress. Once that happens, physicians, researchers and insurers will need to figure out who should get the test and at what cost, and who will pay.']",This story never clearly explained what information is conveyed by a positive or negative test and how the result might be useful for decision-making in patients with cognitive impairment.,"This story describes the FDA approval of a new agent, called Amyvid, that is used together with PET scanning to detect amyloid plaques in the brain. Although the headline suggests that the test will “aid early diagnosis” of Alzheimer’s, the story never explained to readers that a positive test is not an accurate indicator of Alzheimer’s disease. As the FDA pointed out in a statement, “a positive Amyvid scan does not establish a diagnosis of AD because, although patients with AD always have an increased brain content of plaque, the test also may be positive in patients with other types of neurologic conditions, as well as in older people with normal cognition.” It appears that the test is useful primarily to help rule out Alzheimer’s disease in patients who don’t have the condition, since “a negative Amyvid scan indicates few to no neuritic plaques and reduces the likelihood that any cognitive impairment is due to AD,” according to the FDA. This basic, yet critical information should have been the foundation for the story, but somehow escaped mention.

The data were presented today at the Society for Research on Nicotine & Tobacco\'s 22nd Annual Meeting.\n\nChrono\'s wearable transdermal drug delivery device times nicotine delivery to when smokers have their strongest cravings. For example, 75% of all smokers reach for their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up. The Chrono Solution is designed to deliver the first dose of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) shortly before a smoker wakes up and then creates a pattern of ""peaks and troughs"" of nicotine delivery throughout the rest of the day to assure the smoker has more nicotine support when cravings are predicted to be strongest.\n\n""In the United States, 70 percent of smokers want to quit, but quitting is extremely difficult. In fact, most people try 8 to 10 times and this includes quit attempts with standard cessation medications like nicotine patch and gum and prescription drugs like varenicline,"" said Alan Levy, Ph.D., chairman and CEO of Chrono Therapeutics. ""Gums and patches are designed to help manage cravings, but they are only 5 to 9 percent effective. Our goal is to solve this crisis of public health with an innovative, integrated smoking cessation solution, and the data we presented demonstrates that we are on the right path.""\n\nThe clinical trial was a randomized, double blinded study of 24 adult males who smoked 11 or more cigarettes per day, indicating a high level of nicotine dependence. The subjects were divided into two groups. Test group subjects had nicotine administered over a 30-hour time period via Chrono\'s prototype device that delivered nicotine according to Chrono\'s ""peaks and troughs"" profile. Control subjects had a placebo solution, with no nicotine, administered at the same intervals via the same prototype device. Across both groups, subjects showed no serious adverse events or study withdrawals due to an adverse event. Skin irritation assessment showed no signs of irritation or erythema.\n\nCravings were assessed via three different methods: the Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (QSU), the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS) and a single craving question, each of which is a validated tool to assess cravings. When compared to subjects treated with placebo, test subjects had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in cravings for all assessment methods (p=0.035; p=0.034 and p=0.016, respectively).\n\n""Achieving statistical significance in a 24-subject trial is very striking and happens infrequently in biopharma; so these results are very encouraging,"" noted Wende Hutton, general partner at Canaan Partners and a member of Chrono\'s board of directors. ""Quitting smoking is one of the simplest ways to improve global public health, but as the dismal efficacy of current therapies demonstrates, it is also one of the hardest. I\'m very excited to be working with a company that has the potential to solve such a serious problem.""\n\nAbout Chrono Therapeutics\n\nEffective care of the most hard-to-treat conditions requires approaches beyond simply taking medicine. Chrono\'s team is developing the first wearable transdermal drug delivery device that optimizes drug dosing, is embedded with sensor technology to track usage and is connected via Bluetooth to an evidence-based smartphone application that delivers real-time personalized behavioral support to keep users on track to achieve their goals. Chrono\'s first application is in smoking cessation, enabling smokers to overcome the world\'s deadliest addiction.

This news release provides an overview of a smoking cessation product developed by Chrono Therapeutics, and discusses its reported benefits in reducing nicotine cravings. The news release cites a clinical trial that involved 24 men, smoking at baseline at least 11 cigarettes daily, who were randomly assigned to have nicotine delivered over a 30-hour time period through a wearable transdermal drug delivery device. Along with delivering nicotine, the device is synced with a smartphone app that provides “behavioral support.” Compared to the control group who received placebo, the device had a statistically significant effect on reducing nicotine cravings, according to the release. Although we appreciate the details regarding the clinical trial, we note that the trial compares the new device to placebo, so does not inform us about the effectiveness compared to other smoking cessation methods. We are also concerned about the transparency of the study data. When we requested the study abstract upon which the release is based, and which was presented at a national medical meeting, we found that the study pertains to a trial group of 12, not 24 as mentioned in the release. The study abstract also references another trial that was to be completed in October 2015, so we’re left confused about which study was presented at the Society for Research on Nicotine & Tobacco annual meeting.

We are also dismayed at the unjustified claims about solving the world’s smoking problem, a bit grandiose for a trial lasting 30 hours that does not measure smoking outcomes. Smoking is a health risk spanning years or decades, and people trying to quit experience high relapse rates.
[Editor’s note: After this review was published the news release issuer provided additional background on the research presented at the medical conference. According to the company’s representative, “Chrono ended up completing that second study in Sept 2015 and this is the study that generated the p-values for the cravings reduction. Therefore, the company presented more data at SRNT, and wrote the press release inclusive of this, beyond what had originally made it into the abstract. Knowing this, and with the presentation attached, I hope this allows for a fairer evaluation of the release, with the fuller data set clarified.” Although this background clears up the discrepancy between the number of volunteers cited in the news release and the study, it doesn’t affect the overall review rating since we apply our review criteria to the release and not the study.]

New clinical research published today in PLoS One shows that over-the-counter magnesium appears safe and effective to treat mild to moderate depression.\n\nCritical to such body functions as heart rhythm, blood pressure and bone strength, the mineral magnesium plays a role in combating inflammation in the body and has been proven to have an association with depression. However, few clinical trials have studied the supplement\'s effects.\n\nEmily Tarleton, MS, RD, CD, a graduate student in Clinical and Translational Science and the bionutrition research manager in the University of Vermont\'s Clinical Research Center, and colleagues conducted a clinical trial of over-the-counter oral magnesium tablets for mild-to-moderate depression. Their results showed that magnesium is safe and effective and comparable to prescription SSRI treatments in effectiveness.\n\nThe researchers at the University of Vermont\'s Larner College of Medicine conducted an open-label, blocked, randomized cross-over trial involving 126 adults in outpatient primary care clinics. The study participants, who were currently experiencing mild-to-moderate depression, had a mean age of 52, with 38 percent of them male. Participants in the active arm of the study received 248 milligrams of elemental magnesium per day over six weeks, while those in the control arm received no treatment. Depression symptom assessments were conducted on all participants on a bi-weekly basis.\n\nThe study team found that in 112 participants with analyzable data, consumption of magnesium chloride for six weeks resulted in a clinically significant improvement in measures of depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition, these positive effects were shown quickly, at two weeks, and the supplements were well tolerated and similarly effective regardless of age, sex, or use of antidepressants, among other factors.\n\n""This is the first randomized clinical trial looking at the effect of magnesium supplementation on symptoms of depression in U.S. adults,"" says Tarleton.

This news release from the University of Vermont reports on a study showing an association between taking magnesium supplements and a decrease in depression and anxiety symptoms in people with mild-to-moderate depression. The release simplifies and overstates the benefits of magnesium without offering any comparisons (beyond vague statements) with current pharmaceutical treatments for depression.

A new study on nonsmokers found that six months of treatment with nicotine patches restored long-term memory performance to 46% of normal— while placebo patients experienced a 26% decline in recall during the same treatment period.\n\nThe randomized controlled trial included 74 people, mainly in their late 70’s, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI falls somewhere between the normal senior moments that occur with aging, and the more serious lapses in recall and orientation that are typical of dementia. People with MCI are aware of their deficits, but are still able to function and complete their daily activities. Prior research has shown repeatedly that nicotine enhances memory and reaction time, which is one reason smokers cite for sticking with their habit. About half the participants were former smokers.\n\nAttention, memory and reaction time all improved in those given nicotine treatment on several objective tests— and patients’ own ratings of their cognitive abilities and those of family members or other people close to them also showed improvement. Moreover, nicotine’s positive effects did not seem to wane over time. However, when clinical experts rated overall general change in the patients, they did not see a significant difference between the two groups.\n\nMORE: A Cheaper Way to Quit Smoking?\n\nWas the nicotine actually having an effect on memory? Possibly. Intriguingly, it appeared to be more effective among people with two copies of the APOE4 gene, a genetic combination that increases risk for Alzheimer’s by a factor of 20 or higher. People with Alzheimer’s disease have reduced numbers of nicotine receptors in their brains— and while the research is conflicting, some evidence suggests that the drug could protect these neurons. Other research, however, suggests that nicotine might enhance the cancer-causing properties of other substances.\n\nThe authors conclude, “This initial study provides evidence for nicotine-induced cognitive improvement in subjects with MCI; however, whether these effects are clinically important will require larger studies.”\n\nThe study found no problematic side effects associated with the nicotine patch and none of the patients had withdrawal symptoms when it was stopped. However, patients on nicotine did lose a few pounds, which is a known side effect.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institute on Aging, but some of the authors also receive pharmaceutical industry funding and one reported funding from Philip Morris.

In the latest trial to address those limitations, however, meditation does appear to have an effect on reducing heart attack, stroke and even early death from heart disease, at least among African-Americans.\n\nMORE: Losing Focus? Studies Say Meditation May Help\n\n“The main finding [of our research] is that, added on top of usual medical care, intervention with a mind-body technique — transcendental meditation — can have a major effect on cardiovascular events,” says Robert Schneider, lead author on the study published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes and a professor at the Maharishi University of Management, an institution in Iowa that was founded by the creator of transcendental meditation.\n\nHe and his colleagues followed 201 African American men and women, who are at higher risk of heart disease than whites, but who also had addition reason to worry about heart attacks and strokes since they were also diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a health education class about heart-friendly diet and exercise, or to attend a transcendental meditation program. Transcendental meditation involves shutting out the outside world and focusing thoughts inward, or resting while remaining alert. All of the participants continued to receive their normal medical care as well, including appropriate medication.\n\nMORE: Medical Meditation: Say Om Before Surgery\n\nAfter roughly five years of follow-up, the researchers found a 48% reduction in the overall risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause among members of the meditation group compared to those from the health education group. The meditating group enjoyed an average drop of 4.9 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure compared to the control group and also reported less stress and less anger. “It’s like discovering a whole new class of medications,” Schneider says of the power of meditation in improving the patients’ health.\n\nBut while the magnitude of those results is remarkable, the study involved a relatively small number of participants, and did not reveal how meditation may be lowering heart disease risk. On the surface, it’s intuitively obvious that stress management can affect heart health for the better; anxiety and stress cause blood pressure to shoot up and leave us on edge, triggering spikes in heart-harming stress hormones like cortisol.\n\nBut many experts are skeptical of the alleged benefits of techniques such as transcendental meditation that claim to reduce stress by a substantial amount. In the past, these benefits have been hard to test scientifically, largely because study participants who volunteered for meditation programs may have been biased to see them succeed. Practitioners have also made strong and essentially unsubstantiated claims about the powers of meditation, leading heart experts and scientists to be especially skeptical. In fact, in 2005, more than 500 brain researchers signed a petition (albeit an unsuccessful one) to protest a scheduled lecture on the neuroscience of meditation by the Buddhist spiritual icon, the Dalai Lama, at a major conference organized by the Society for Neuroscience.\n\nMORE: Mind Over Matter: Can Zen Meditation Help You Forget About Pain?\n\nThe great lengths to which the researchers of the Circulation study went to make their trial scientifically rigorous, however, should reinforce the results in the eyes of some skeptics. The scientists adjusted for the effects of weight, smoking behavior, and diet, all of which can influence heart attack, stroke and early heart death rates. And while the participants in both groups exercised more and cut back on alcohol during the study, they did so at similar rates, making these changes unlikely to be responsible for the differences in health outcomes either.\n\nWhile the findings aren’t likely to resolve questions over whether meditation should become a standard part of heart disease care, the results should give more doctors confidence in discussing the practice with their patients and giving them some scientifically based information that’s an improvement over the advice that “it can’t hurt to try.”\n\nVIDEO: Practicing Meditation for Female Pleasure""]","This TIME.com story suggests that this study will win over skeptics with the strength of its evidence.

But cardiologists have long relied on so-called stress testing as a simpler, cheaper “gatekeeper” procedure to identify people more likely to benefit from the riskier, more invasive and more costly catheterizations.\n\nCT angiograms have recently emerged as yet another non-invasive alternative. A handful of studies, Zadeh says, have suggested CT angiographies may be superior, but uncertainty has persisted due the small number of people involved in these analyses, and stress tests have remained the more popular choice among clinicians.\n\nResults of the new study, the research team says, should help settle lingering doubts among physicians and the nearly 15 million Americans who seek medical attention each year for symptoms that signal a clogged artery, including chest pain, shortness of breath and extreme fatigue.\n\nIn CT angiography, clinicians use dye injected into the circulation to visualize blockages inside the arteries. When the dye reaches impenetrable or narrowed passages clogged by fatty buildups or clots, the scan shows a blockage. The so-called nuclear exercise stress tests also use dye and CT scans but instead of directly visualizing the interior of the arteries, they measure blood flow to the heart muscle immediately after a patient walks on a treadmill. Reduced blood flow to the heart muscle is a signal that a narrowed or blocked artery is not supplying the muscle with enough blood. Although exercise stress testing is generally safe for most people, it can rarely trigger an abnormal heart rhythm or even an actual heart attack in people with seriously clogged arteries.\n\nResearchers emphasize that both nuclear stress tests and CT angiograms expose patients to radiation. While many newer CT scans deliver substantially lower doses of radiation than the scans used in nuclear stress tests, the dose and protocols can vary widely from hospital to hospital, researchers say. CT angiograms and nuclear stress tests carry similar price tags —between $750 and $1,200. Researchers say the total tab stemming from either test, including downstream costs related to additional testing due to unclear or unrelated findings, remains unclear and should be an important consideration in crafting any new testing recommendations.\n\nFor the current study, 391 patients, ages 45 to 85, seen at 16 hospitals in eight countries, underwent noninvasive CT angiograms, followed by traditional, catheter-based coronary angiographies. Within two months, each patient also underwent an exercise stress test. All patients had symptoms suggestive of heart disease, but not all had a previous diagnosis of the condition.\n\nOverall, non-invasive CT angiograms accurately detected or ruled out artery blockages in 91 percent of patients, compared with 69 percent for stress testing. When researchers analyzed test performance in a subgroup of 111 patients with very high-risk disease as identified on traditional angiography, the diagnostic accuracy of CT angiograms went up to 96 percent, compared with 80 percent for stress testing. In other words, researchers report, stress tests missed two out of every 10 patients with severe disease, marked by multiple blockages.\n\nCurrent guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College Cardiology call for a stress tests in all patients who show signs of coronary artery disease to confirm the diagnosis and define the severity of the blockage. CT angiograms are generally reserved only for patients with borderline stress test results. But given its much higher accuracy, the researchers say, CT angiography may be a better first-line test in people with symptoms suggestive of a blocked artery.\n\nOther investigators from Johns Hopkins included Rodrigo Cerci, Richard George, Andrea Vavere, João Lima, Jeffrey Brinker and Julie Miller. Other institutions involved in the research included Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Charité Hospital in Germany, St. Luke’s Hospital in Japan, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.\n\nThe work was funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, under grant number HL006138-04, and by Toshiba Medical Systems, manufacturer of the scanner used in the trials.']",This news release makes the premature suggestion that CT angiograms replace stress tests as a noninvasive method for identifying clogged arteries. But the latter test provides important information that the former lacks.,"This release from Johns Hopkins describes results from a head-to-head comparison study that found computed tomography (CT) scans of the heart’s vessels outperformed single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) stress tests in detecting clogged arteries. The analysis came from a trial that compared how well the two noninvasive imaging techniques (CT scans and SPECT stress tests) matched up with invasive coronary angiography.
A quick read of this news release could erroneously lead readers to believe the current standard initial imaging test for a blocked heart artery, SPECT stress testing, should be immediately tossed aside in favor of CT angiography, and that the switch would improve heart attack prevention.
While the release had several strengths, it inflated the benefits and soft-pedaled study limitations. Our reviewers suggest the findings are of modest importance because while identifying blocked arteries is important, the bigger question is: What is the prognosis (what will happen to me if I don’t do anything differently?) and how should patients be treated? Identifying blocked vessels is part of that, but it doesn’t provide a complete picture. The release doesn’t mention that elements of the standard stress test, unlike the CT scan, can help predict prognosis. The release presumes that finding blocked arteries is the goal when really what patients and providers need to know is whether or not to undergo additional interventions.

This study -- which is the first to suggest that the reduction in risk occurs for low-dose aspirin -- was proposed by City of Hope\'s Leslie Bernstein, Ph.D., professor and director of the Division of Biomarkers of Early Detection and Prevention, and published online in the journal, Breast Cancer Research.\n\nBernstein and her colleagues saw an overall 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer in women who reported using low-dose aspirin at least three times per week. Such regular use of low-dose aspirin reduced the risk by 20 percent of estrogen or progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, which is the most common breast cancer subtype.\n\n""The study found an interesting protective association between low-dose aspirin and breast cancer,"" said lead author Christina A. Clarke, Ph.D., M.P.H., from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. ""We did not by and large find associations with the other pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. We also did not find associations with regular aspirin since this type of medication is taken sporadically for headaches or other pain, and not daily for prevention of cardiovascular disease.""\n\nThis study differed from other studies that have looked at aspirin and cancer risk because it focused on the dose levels of the aspirin women had taken and tracked the frequency of the use of low-dose aspirin as opposed to regular aspirin. It was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer.\n\n""We already knew that aspirin is a weak aromatase inhibitor and we treat women with breast cancer with stronger aromatase inhibitors since they reduce the amount of estrogen postmenopausal women have circulating in their blood,"" said Bernstein. ""We thought that if aspirin can inhibit aromatase, it ought to reduce the likelihood that breast cancer would develop and it could also be an effective way to improve breast cancer patients\' prognosis once they no longer take the more potent aromatase inhibitors."" Bernstein added, ""Aspirin also reduces inflammation, which may be another mechanism by which aspirin taken regularly can lower risk of breast cancer developing or recurring.""\n\nAs part of the study, researchers analyzed data recorded in questionnaires submitted by 57,164 women in the California\'s Teacher\'s Study. In 2005, participants answered questions regarding family history of cancer and other conditions, use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), menstrual and reproductive history, use of hormones, weight and height, living environment, diet, alcohol use and physical activity. In the ensuing years before 2013, 1,457 of these participants developed invasive breast cancer.\n\nThe team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose ""baby"" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer.\n\nNow that we have some data separating low-dose from higher-dose aspirin, more detailed research can be undertaken to understand the full value of low-dose aspirin for breast cancer prevention,"" said Clarke.""\n\n###\n\nOther collaborating authors include Alison J. Canchola, M.S., and Lisa M. Moy, M.P.H., from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California, and Susan L. Neuhausen, Ph.D., The Morris & Horowitz Families Professor in Cancer Etiology & Outcomes Research, Nadia T. Chung, M.P.H., and James V.

While the release states that low doses of aspirin “reduces the risk of breast cancer in women,” there are problems with how the information is presented. Specifically, it’s impossible to know whether the aspirin affected breast cancer risk based on this study. That’s because this was an observational study — meaning that it could detect a correlation between aspirin use and breast cancer, but not whether the use of aspirin was actually responsible for lower rates of breast cancer. That’s a key distinction.

(istockphoto)\n\nThree long-awaited studies have shown that mechanically removing a blood clot from a stroke patient’s brain is no more useful than the older treatment of giving an IV dose of a clot-dissolving drug to the whole body.\n\nThe results of the clinical trials, presented this week at a meeting in Hawaii, shocked and surprised stroke physicians. Many had already adopted the more aggressive strategy over the past decade.\n\n“For the stroke field, this is a really big deal,” Walter Koroshetz, deputy director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said of the findings, which were presented over three days at the International Stroke Conference in Hono\xadlulu.\n\nNINDS paid for two of the trials, one of which cost $27 million. One study took eight years to complete because it was so difficult to enroll patients willing to take the chance that they would be randomly assigned to get the older treatment.\n\nPractitioners hoped that “endovascular treatment,” in which a catheter is threaded into a blocked artery and the clot pulled out, would do for stroke patients what it has done for heart attack patients. In them, going after clots with angioplasty balloons and stents is clearly more effective than giving clot-dissolving drugs through a vein in the arm.\n\n“We did this study with the strong expectation that we would find a positive benefit. We were surprised,” said Joseph P. Broderick of the University of Cincinnati Neuroscience Institute, who headed one of the studies.\n\nHis view was echoed by Alfonso Ciccone, a neurologist from Milan who led a clinical trial in Italy: “We were surprised. We wanted the superiority of endovascular treatment.”\n\nWhether the findings will cause physicians to abandon the practice is uncertain.\n\nInsurance companies and Medicare, the health insurer for the elderly, already cover the endovascular procedure. It costs about $23,000 compared with $11,000 for acute stroke treatment using intravenous clot-dissolving drugs, known as thrombolytics.\n\nFurther, many practitioners think that newer clot-retrieving devices work better than the ones used in the three trials. Because endovascular procedures were shown to be no more dangerous than IV thrombolytics, physicians may continue to perform them and assume the outcomes can only get better.\n\n“Will it change practice? That’s a good question,” said Koroshetz. “The payers may look at this and wonder if they should continue paying for these procedures. If it gets to that point, then clearly things will change.”\n\nStroke is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. About 800,000 people suffer a stroke each year, and about 130,000 die.\n\nNearly 90 percent of strokes occur when a clot blocks an artery in the brain, starving the region downstream of blood and oxygen. If flow isn’t restored quickly, brain tissue and the functions it controls — movement, speech, cognition — are damaged or can die.\n\nOver the past 20 years, studies showed that if a person having a stroke gets a thrombolytic drug within three hours of when the symptoms start (4½ hours for certain patients), the process can be reversed and a lifetime of disability avoided. Later than that, little is gained; the brain cells are too damaged to survive. In fact, giving the drugs too late can make matters worse. Uncontrolled bleeding can occur as the dying tissue breaks down.\n\nEarly observations suggested that approaching the clot with a catheter and either injecting clot-dissolving drugs into it or snagging it and pulling it out produced better results. In 2004, the FDA began approving use of the catheters in the brain because they had been proved useful elsewhere in the body. The three studies reported this week (which will eventually be published in the New England Journal of Medicine) tested the hypothesis in a rigorous way.\n\nIn the largest trial, called IMS III, all patients got the IV clot-dissolving drug tPA within three hours of the start of stroke symptoms. Half were then assigned to get an imaging study that looked at the arteries of the brain to see whether a blockage remained. If it did, the doctors went after it with an endovascular procedure. The other half of the patients got standard treatment, which didn’t include the procedure. Forty-one percent of patients recovered completely in the endovascular group and 39 percent recovered completely in the control group, outcomes that were no different statistically. Death within three months was essentially the same too: 19 percent vs. 22 percent.\n\nIn the Italian study, called SYNTHESIS Expansion, 362 stroke patients were randomly assigned to get either IV tPA or endovascular treatment. At three months, 35 percent of the patients in the tPA group were alive without any disabilities, compared with 30 percent of the endovascular group. That also was not significantly different.\n\nThe third study, called MR RESCUE, run out of Georgetown University, was more complicated.\n\nIt randomly assigned 118 patients less than eight hours out from the start of their strokes to receive standard care or have the clot removed with a catheter device. They also got CAT or MRI scans to see whether they had a large or small amount of brain tissue still alive and salvageable. Removing the clot wasn’t better than standard care in either group — those with a lot or a little brain tissue to lose.\n\n“I think everybody was a little surprised. But mainly disappointed,” said Chelsea S. Kidwell, the Georgetown neurologist who headed the study.\n\nWhy endovascular treatment wasn’t better is a mystery that the researchers are struggling to explain. The answer could be in the patients, the device or the timing of the procedure.\n\nIn IMS III, patients with large strokes benefited from clot removal more than those with small ones, but there weren’t enough patients in the study to make such a fine distinction with certainty.\n\n“It’s a hint. But it’s not proof,” Broderick said.\n\nIn MR RESCUE, only 67 percent of arteries opened up completely after the clot was grabbed. Current devices, which use a mesh stent to hold the clot more firmly, are successful more than 80 percent of the time.\n\n“The stroke community is hopeful that with the new generation devices we will show better outcomes,” Kidwell said.\n\nIn the Italian study, patients getting endovascular treatment were 3.75 hours into their stroke — an hour longer than those getting IV treatment, because of the logistics of assembling the procedure team. “That hour could have made a difference. We know that ‘time is brain,’ ” Ciccone said.\n\nThe three trials demonstrated how hard it is to test things once they’re in widespread use. History is replete with treatments (such as supplemental oxygen for premature infants) and devices (such as pulmonary artery catheters) used routinely before being shown to be harmful or of little value.\n\nIt took from 2004 to 2011 for the MR RESCUE team to recruit the 118 patients in the trial. It had permission to run the study in 30 hospitals but found only 22 that were willing to participate. More than 10 other hospitals were invited to join but declined because their neurologists were already convinced the catheter treatment was better — a view that turns out not to be true.']",Excellent job on a story that received very little mainstream news media attention.,"History, context, costs, evidence – all were covered in this story.  But the reporter also introduces the nagging question of whether “true believer” physicians will ignore the findings.

If the experimental medication is eventually approved for use, it would be only the second oral MS drug available to patients, alongside a number of long-standing injectable options.\n\n""The injectables aren\'t going to go away,"" commented Dr. Scott S. Zamvil, a professor of neurology and faculty member in the program in immunology at the University of California, San Francisco. ""We went 17 years with injectables before we got our first oral option, \'Gilenya\', just last year. But there\'s a lot of excitement about this new option and these results, because even though the injectables are safe and effective in terms of convenience and patient compliance, oral drugs are much better than shots.""\n\n""And with the one oral option we have today, there has been a lot of concern over a possible risk for immune suppression and also an increased risk for cancer,"" added Zamvil, who was not a part of the current study team. ""That does not seem to be the case with this new drug. So this appears to be a significant advance forward.""\n\nThe current research was funded by Teva Pharmaceuticals, the maker of laquinimod.\n\nThe lead study author is Dr. Giancarlo Comi, director of the department of neurology and the Institute of Experimental Neurology at the Scientific Institute and University Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, Italy. He is slated to present his team\'s findings this week in Honolulu at the American Academy of Neurology meeting.\n\nIn the two-year, double-blind Phase III trial, participants were randomly divided into two groups: those who were given a daily dose of laquinimod (0.6 milligrams) and those who were given a sugar-pill (placebo); neither the researchers nor the participants knew who received the medication or the placebo.\n\nThe annual rate of MS relapse was 23 percent lower in the laquinimod group compared with the placebo group.\n\nIn addition, disability progression was reduced by 36 percent and brain atrophy by 33 percent compared with those getting the sham treatment.\n\nAdverse events, including serious events, were comparable to those in the placebo group, according to the researchers. The incidence of liver enzyme elevation was higher in patients treated with laquinimod, according to Comi, but he added that the elevations were temporary, reversible and did not lead to any signs of liver problems.\n\nLaquinimod was not, however, tested against currently existing treatment alternatives, the authors stressed. The team added that the new medication appears to tackle MS by a different type of mechanism than other available options, and apparently works by curtailing the onset of permanent tissue damage while limiting acute inflammation.\n\n""Each of the medications we have has a different mechanism of action,"" explained Dr. Gary Birnbaum, director of the MS Treatment and Research Center at the Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology. ""And MS is probably not a single disease. So different medications may work better for some and not others, which is why this new drug could end up being an important addition to the armamentarium.""\n\n""However, we still need to have a head-to-head comparison with other drugs,"" cautioned Birnbaum, who was not part of the study team. ""This is not that. And it\'s also important to note that this is not a cure. It achieved a reduction in the annualized relapse rate, and people on this medication did not have as many attacks per year as people on a placebo. But a 23 percent reduction is not a cure. This didn\'t stop MS.""\n\n""But, this is extremely hopeful research,"" he added. And if it is approved, it\'ll be a valuable adjunct to the array of treatment options now available.""\n\nSince the study is being presented at a medical meeting, it should be considered preliminary until the findings are published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on multiple sclerosis, visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story about a possible new oral medication for treating multiple sclerosis (MS) packs a lot of good information into a tight and clearly written story.</span>","Readers are well served by information on the study’s design, the preliminary nature of the research, the industry-funding behind the work and the strength of the study’s findings.

Tai chi, sometimes known as ""shadow boxing,"" is a form of martial arts which combines slow graceful movements with meditation. HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS Tai chi, an ancient Chinese practice of exercise and meditation, may relieve symptoms of a painful chronic condition called fibromyalgia, a small new study shows. Tai chi involves gentle, flowing movements in which students shift their weight and breathe deeply, cycling through a series of stances with poetic names, such as ""white crane spreads its wings."" The philosophy of tai chi involves moving a person\'s vital energy, or qi (""chee""), through the body. In the study, doctors randomly assigned 66 fibromyalgia patients to take either a 12-week tai chi class or attend a ""wellness education"" class that included stretching exercises, according to a study in today\'sNew England Journal of Medicine. Fibromyalgia patients experience pain, stiffness, fatigue and other problems. \'CHI RUNNING\': Athletes say it\'s injury-free ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE: Americans spend $34 billion a year All participants attended two hour-long classes a week and had instructions to practice at home 20 minutes a day. Most were women with an average age of 50, and most were overweight. After finishing the course, 79% of tai chi participants said their symptoms had improved, compared with 39% of those in the educational class, the study shows. It was financed by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a branch of the National Institutes of Health. Tai chi students reported improvements in mood, sleep, quality of life and their ability to exercise. Even three months after the classes ended, 82% of tai chi students still felt better, compared with 53% of the comparison group, the study says. A study in 2007 from the National Institutes of Health found that 2.3 million American adults had used tai chi in the past year. In an accompanying editorial, Harvard Medical School\'s Gloria Yeh and others note that the study had limitations. Yeh notes that researchers don\'t know which aspects of tai chi were most helpful: the exercise, deep breathing, relaxation exercise, meeting new friends or learning from a charismatic teacher. Because all students knew which type of class they were taking, it\'s possible that tai chi could act like a placebo, so patients improved simply because they expected to. Yeh suggests conducting a larger, longer study — with multiple teachers, at different locations, perhaps comparing it with yoga and other therapies — to really understand tai chi\'s benefits. But Callahan notes that tai chi has few drawbacks. Even the cost of a class, which can top $50 a month, is modest compared with the cost of many medications. And unlike drugs, tai chi had no harmful side effects, she says. Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Study participants were all aged 42 to 60, with a median age of 53.\n\nThose men who enjoyed a sauna two or three times a week had a 23% lower risk of experiencing a fatal episode of coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease, compared to those who took just one sauna a week, according to researchers.\n\nThe apparent health benefits for men who used the sauna four to seven times a week was even greater: They had a 48% lower risk of similar incidents when compared to men who used the sauna only once a week, researchers said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The higher frequency of sauna bathing was related to considerable decreased risks of sudden cardiac death, fatal coronary heart disease, fatal cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality,” the authors wrote.\n\nThe researchers said a similar health benefit was unlikely to be found in steam rooms and hot tubs, due to the unique conditions of Finnish saunas.\n\nA traditional Finnish sauna has dry air (10% to 20% humidity) and a recommended temperature of 176 degrees to 212 degrees. Humidity is increased temporarily by throwing water on the hot rocks of the sauna heater, and most Finns are accustomed to using a sauna once a week.\n\nOn average, the men in the study used a sauna twice a week, at a temperature of about 174 degrees. The average time spent in the sauna was about 14 minutes, researchers say.\n\nThe super-heated conditions of a sauna provoke a variety of physical reactions.\n\nHeart rate can climb to 100 or 150 beats per minute -- similar to low- or moderate-intensity exercise -- and sweat is secreted at a rate of about 2 pounds per hour.\n\nHigh temperatures also causes the body to flow more blood to the skin and less to internal organs.\n\n“Previous studies have suggested that sauna bathing might have some harmful effects, whereas our results indicated a protective effect,” the authors wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers noted that only 1% to 2% of sudden deaths occurred within 24 hours of sauna bathing. Alcohol intake was a major contributing factor in those cases, authors wrote.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, speculated on a number of possible reasons for the observed benefits.\n\n“Although we do not know why the men who took saunas more frequently had greater longevity (whether it is the time spent in the hot room, the relaxation time, the leisure of a life that allows for more relaxation time, or the camaraderie of the sauna), clearly time spent in the sauna is time well spent,” Redberg wrote.\n\nFollow @montemorin for science news']",This was a report on a Finnish study about the potential cardiovascular benefits of frequent sauna use. Read our review before you commit to a daily sit in the sweat lodge.,"On the plus side, the story makes it clear that we don’t know if sauna use — or some other factor associated with sauna use — is responsible for the benefits observed in the study.

(May 1, 2018)--An estimated 45 percent of people are at risk of developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) in their lifetime. According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method.\n\nNonsurgical treatments for knee OA supported by previous research evidence include strength training, low-impact aerobic exercises, NSAIDs, and weight loss in individuals with a body mass index over 25. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.\n\n""This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,"" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. ""Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.""\n\nAuthors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective. They found the following:\n\nFor pain reduction, cortisone injections provided the greatest short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief, followed by ibuprofen, PRP injections, naproxen, and celecoxib.\n\nNaproxen ranked the highest for probability for improving function, followed by diclofenac, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and PRP injections.\n\nNaproxen was ranked the most effective individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function followed by cortisone injections, PRP injections, ibuprofen and celecoxib.\n\nHA injections did not achieve a rank in the top five treatments for pain, function, or combined pain and function.

This study covers primary prevention, or devices implanted in patients who have never had a serious heart-rhythm incident.\n\n""I was surprised -- I expected [the proportion] to be lower,"" Sana Al-Khatib, lead author of the study and a cardiologist at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, tells the Health Blog. Previous research has suggested that the devices are underused in some eligible patients, she says.\n\nHere\'s the WSJ story on the study. As the paper reports, the study was released early after an embargo break, and shares of device makers seemed to drop as word leaked out. Analysts at Wells Fargo said in a research note that the study could provoke a decline of about 5% in the worldwide ICD market. Medtronic shares were down less than 1% to $37.10 in late trading, while Boston Scientific shares were down 1.5% to $7.49 and St. Jude Medical shares were down 2.9% to $41.06. Read the WSJ story to get perspective from Medtronic and Boston Scientific.\n\nSome of the patients in the study weren\'t appropriate candidates for an ICD because they\'d been excluded from trials -- such as newly diagnosed heart failure patients who are supposed to first try tinkering with medication levels. Other patients weren\'t considered appropriate because studies showed they weren\'t likely to benefit from them, for example, patients newly recovering from a heart attack.\n\nThe authors emphasize that decisions about ICDs will ultimately come down to the best judgment of the physician and patient. But even if some cases fall into a gray zone where a decision to implant an ICD is not based on evidence but is nonetheless ""reasonable,"" not all of the 22.5% of cases identified in the study likely fit the bill, says Al-Khatib.\n\nIn a statement, the Heart Rhythm Society, a professional group for cardiac arrhythmia specialists, says that ""the vast majority of implanting physicians are prescribing ICDs with the confidence that they are providing the best care for their patients."" The group ""encourages research that will further improve the use and effectiveness of ICDs to improve overall quality of care,"" the statement says.\n\nWhile the characteristics of patients receiving non-evidence-based ICD implants likely contribute to higher rates of in-hospital mortality and complications, those complications are particularly worrisome when there\'s no likely benefit from the procedure, Al-Khatib says.\n\nThe study also finds that electrophysiologists, who specialize in heart-rhythm issues, were less likely to implant ICDs in patients for whom there was no evidence of benefit. (Read: Specialty Matters When Implanting Defibrillators)\n\n""The way I look at this is that it\'s an opportunity for improvement"" and to see if a ""lack of knowledge or awareness of the guidelines is playing a role,"" says Al-Khatib.\n\nAuthors of the study reported receiving funding from Medtronic and other device- and drug makers.\n\nUpdate: Adds comment from the Heart Rhythm Society.\n\nImage courtesy of Columbia University Medical Center']","<span style=""font-size: small;""> Not as complete as the </span>","This blog post about a study revealing some new data about the overuse of heart implants does some things quite well, but it falls short on a number of our measures.

The product, called Hello, Peanut, can be mixed into puréed baby food to expose infants to peanuts starting around five months old.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration allowed the new item, developed by a physician, to make the claim just months after the nation’s top allergy experts reversed longstanding advice on preventing peanut allergies, dropping recommendations to withhold all peanut-containing foods in early childhood in favor of early, frequent exposure, starting with peanut powder or extract for infants beginning to eat solid food. The label warns that evidence is limited.\n\nWhile many foods like whole grains, nuts and supplements carry qualified health claims stating that they may reduce the risk of diseases like cancer or heart disease, this is the first time a food product label will be allowed to make a qualified claim that it reduces the risk of an allergy, officials said. A qualified claim means there is evidence supporting the claim, but it is not conclusive.\n\n“This is a very important claim for us to allow to be incorporated into food labels,” said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the F.D.A. “The guidelines for how to approach allergens in children are changing, the science is changing, and it’s important for parents to know.”']","The story was strong on many points, though we wished it had better explained what a qualified health claim is, and why changing guidelines based on one study can be risky.","This New York Times story covers the health claims of Hello, Peanut!, a powdered peanut product that allows parents to gradually expose their infants to peanuts, in accordance with pediatricians’ and allergists’ advice that the practice reduces the risk of children developing peanut allergies.
The recently released, updated medical advice promoting early exposure to peanuts is a complete reversal from the American Academy of Pediatrics’ previous guidelines, which said that high-risk infants should avoid peanuts up to age 3. New guidelines are based on the results of one study conducted in 628 infants at high risk for peanut allergy, which found that early introduction of peanuts significantly decreased the frequency of the development of peanut allergy and modulated immune responses to peanuts.
The story covers the science behind the change as well as a range of reactions concerning the new product and its qualified health claim.

Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment\'s brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.\n\nAD\n\nIn late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn\'t respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.\n\nAD\n\nBiotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah\'s, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta\'s cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.\n\nThe FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies. CAR T-cell therapies are among several approaches, along with treatments called checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, but they have recently grabbed much of the attention. Dozens of other companies also are working on them.\n\nAD\n\n“Today, marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement, adding that the approval demonstrates “the continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine.”\n\nAD\n\nA CAR T-cell therapy involves a complicated and customized procedure in which T cells — sometimes called the foot soldiers of the immune system — are removed from the patient. They are sent to a special lab and genetically modified to target a protein on the surface of the patient\'s cancer cells. Once the modified cells are returned to the patient, their numbers expand exponentially as they become an army of cancer fighters.\n\nIn 2015, Marie Miceli was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma at Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis, which is jointly owned by Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. She received chemo and underwent a bone-marrow transplant. Neither worked.\n\nAD\n\n“The doctors were saying, \'Go see an attorney and get your life in order,\' "" the 64-year-old Realtor recalled. Then they offered her a slot in Kite\'s clinical trial, a last-resort effort. “I could feel it when they put those T cells back in,” she said. “It was the craziest feeling in the world.” When she was checked a month later, she said, her cancer was gone. It hasn\'t returned.\n\nAD\n\nKite\'s “vein-to-vein” turnaround period — from cell extraction to reinfusion — is about 17 days, according to Frederick Locke, an oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa and co-leader of the Kite trial.\n\nThe FDA said the safety and efficacy of Yescarta were established in a multi-center trial of more than 100 adults with large B-cell lymphoma. An independent review committee found that 72 percent of patients treated with a single infusion responded to therapy, including 51 percent who then showed no evidence of remaining cancer. Kite has said that at six months, 44 percent of patients were still responding, with 39 percent having no sign of cancer.\n\nAD\n\n“This is not just an incremental benefit,” said David Chang, Kite\'s chief medical officer. “It raises the potential that a cure can be possible.” Some of the first patients who underwent treatment now have been in remission for three to five years, he said, although he cautioned that it\'s still too early to know whether those patients are cured.\n\nAD\n\nLocke said about 13 percent of patients in the trial had a severe side effect known as cytokine release syndrome, which produces high fevers, low blood pressure and other flulike symptoms. Twenty-eight percent had neurological “events,” such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment.\n\n“These are patients who knew they were out of options,” he said, noting that lymphoma patients who relapse or don\'t respond to treatment have just a 50 percent chance of surviving for six months.\n\nAD\n\nBecause of the side effects, the treatment will carry a boxed warning, the FDA\'s most serious. In addition, the agency is requiring hospitals and clinics that dispense Yescarta to be certified after undergoing special training.\n\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. This type of cancer begins in the immune system and can be fast- or slow-growing, the FDA noted.\n\nAD\n\nKite\'s CAR T-cell product was developed years ago at the National Cancer Institute by pioneering scientist Steven Rosenberg and licensed to the company for commercialization.\n\nArmin Ghobadi, an oncologist at Siteman who was an investigator in the Kite trial, said the new treatment is “just the first step” and that researchers are working to make it safer and more effective. He said the therapy already has been life-changing for many of his patients — and for him.\n\n“There\'s nothing worse than telling patients, \'I\'m sorry, we are done here, we don\'t have anything else to offer,\' "" he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD']",The tone of this story is that CAR T-cell therapy represents a cure (,"We applaud this story for taking the time to walk readers through the different side effects from the drug — including patient deaths — and for raising the issue of the high cost of the drug. However, we would have liked to have seen a clearer description on the benefits of the therapy and more explanation of both the evidence underpinning the findings and the availability of the drug.
Though the tone of this story is that CAR T-cell therapy represents a cure (“This is not just an incremental benefit”), the results suggest otherwise. The story states that at 6 months only 44% are still responding and 39% have no sign of cancer. There was no control group, and it’s still early on, so whether this therapy represents a long-term cure and for how many remains to be established.

Not everyone agrees,"[""An analysis of two influential studies of prostate cancer screening concludes that the much-debated test “significantly” reduces deaths from the disease, suggesting that current recommendations against routine PSA screening might be steering men away from a lifesaving procedure.\n\nThe analysis, published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine, drew wildly different reactions, as is often the case with research on PSA screenings. Some experts in cancer screening and statistics said its novel approach was “on shaky ground” and used a “completely unverifiable” methodology that they had “never seen before,” but others praised its “intriguing and innovative approach.” There was one area of agreement, however: “I imagine it’s going to generate some buzz,” said biostatistician Ted Karrison of the University of Chicago.\n\nIf the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. For a man in the U.S., the risk of dying of prostate cancer is about 2.5 percent. A mortality reduction of 30 percent would lower the death rate to 1.75 percent, said epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the study’s senior author.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“If a screening test reduces cancer mortality by 20 percent, it’s considered a successful test,” Etzioni said. “I think the [prostate-cancer] mortality reduction we calculate is a significant benefit. This is a screening test that saves lives.”\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Cancer Briefing A weekly look at the latest in cancer research, treatment, and patient care. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nThose gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such “overdiagnoses” outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1.\n\nThe new study lands amid another shift in how experts view PSA screening, which measures blood levels of a molecule sometimes associated with prostate cancer. In 2012 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, whose recommendations help determine that procedures insurance should cover, recommended against routine PSA tests because of their many risks and tiny benefits. Among other drawbacks, the tests lead to overdiagnosis (meaning a biopsy finds malignant cells but they are so innocuous they would never harm, let alone kill, the man) as well as incontinence and impotence from treatment (including of harmless cancers).\n\nIn April, however, the task force proposed instead that men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA’s pros and cons with their doctor and then decide what to do, factoring in that if 1,000 men get regular PSA screening for a decade it will save about one life. (Older and younger men are still advised not to have routine screening.)\n\nThe rationale for the re-analysis led by Etzioni is that the PLCO study was a bit of a mess. It assigned half of its nearly 77,000 participants, men ages 55 to 74, to have yearly PSA tests and the other half to not do so. But 46 percent of the men in the no-PSA group had yearly PSAs anyway. As a result, when researchers counted deaths in each group, it wasn’t a clean comparison: Rather than comparing screened to unscreened men, they were comparing assigned-to-screening men to not-assigned-to-screening men.\n\nThe finding that assigned-to-screening men were no more likely to avoid death from prostate cancer might therefore have been because their screening behavior wasn’t different enough from the “unscreened” (but in fact partly screened) men’s, not because PSA screening doesn’t save lives.\n\nIn an effort to untangle that possibility, Etzioni and 21 co-authors from 10 countries created multiple mathematical models. They all rely on estimates of “lead time,” or how much sooner a cancer is detected because of PSA instead of because symptoms are detected. The models incorporated the records of all the PLCO men and ignored which group they’d been assigned to.\n\nBottom line: Screened men’s cancers were detected earlier than unscreened men’s, and more frequent screening advanced detection more. That moved some prostate cancers from too-advanced-to-treat to treatable, reducing prostate cancer mortality by 27 percent to 32 percent over 11 years, Etzioni and her colleagues conclude.\n\nResearchers not involved in the study weren’t convinced. “The concern is that men in the no-screening group but who chose to get screened anyway might differ in important ways from men who stayed with no-screening,” Karrison said. They might be more health conscious or conscientious, or have other traits associated with longevity. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. Two prominent experts in cancer prevention and statistics agreed, but said they did not want to be publicly identified as criticizing the new analysis because some of its authors are colleagues of theirs.\n\nDr. Kenneth Lin of Georgetown University Medical Center, a former staffer at the USPSTF, said crediting PSA tests with reducing prostate cancer mortality by around 30 percent was probably an overstatement, especially since mathematical models are only models. An earlier one for the PLCO study concluded that more men died in its screening group than in the don’t-get-screened group. “Models are models,” Lin said. “No matter how sophisticated, they shouldn’t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized trials” — which in PLCO found zero lives saved from PSA screening.\n\nA researcher associated with the Preventive Services Task Force, but who was not permitted to speak to reporters while the group is finalizing its PSA recommendation, said the panel would incorporate the new paper in its analysis. “But honestly,” he said, “I don’t know that this adds a great deal to our understanding.”""]","A thorough, nuanced and balanced examination of a re-analysis of two major PSA trials show the complexities involved in PSA screening research and underscores the difficulty physicians and patients face when it comes prostate cancer prevention.","This examination of two new mathematical modeling studies on the value of PSA testing accurately nails the problems in interpreting research of this nature and why it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. The reader is left with a broader understanding of different factors that might affect prostate cancer detection, including what is often called the “healthy user bias”–when those who undergo screening and/or treatments might be a healthier cohort of patients to begin with and it is that factor, not the decision to undergo screening/ treatment, that is the main reason for apparent improved survival. A Los Angeles Times story we reviewed on the same study didn’t provide this important context.

(1)\n\nThis paper emphasized that overall diet quality, rather than individual foods, may have a greater impact on reducing risk of physical function impairments. Specifically, diet quality traits most associated with reduced rates of incident physical impairment were higher intake of fruits and vegetables; lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium; and moderate alcohol intake. Among food components, the strongest relations were found for increased intakes of oranges, orange juice, apples, pears, romaine or leaf lettuce, and walnuts.\n\n""There\'s a lot of research that looks at specific health conditions in aging, such as diabetes and heart disease, but less attention to research on quality of life and ability to maintain independence with aging,"" said Dr. Francine Grodstein, ScD, professor of medicine at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. ""The simple message from this study is that eating an overall healthy diet, including certain foods, such as walnuts and other whole foods, may help women with the ability to do key everyday tasks as they age, like carrying groceries or dressing themselves.""\n\nThe researchers looked at data from 54,762 women in the Nurses\' Health Study, which tracked women for over 30 years. Between 1992 and 2008, the women were asked questions about their physical function, including their ability to perform basic activities of daily living. This new paper prospectively examined the association between the dietary habits of the participants and subsequent impairment in physical function. Diet was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), a measure of diet quality that incorporates foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk based on scientific evidence.\n\n""These results add to the large body of evidence that outline the many benefits of a healthy diet for women. Additional research is needed to better understand how diet and lifestyle choices can help maintain our health and well-being as we age,"" said Dr. Grodstein.\n\nThere are numerous possible active properties in walnuts that may be contributing factors in providing health benefits. Walnuts are unique among nuts in that they are primarily composed of polyunsaturated fat (13 grams per ounce), which includes alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. They are the only nut to contain a significant amount of ALA with 2.5 grams per one ounce serving.\n\nSome study limitations should be considered. The sample only included women, so these results may not be generalizable to men. Additionally, participants were not assigned to eat walnuts or other foods, and were just asked about their dietary choices. It is also possible that subjects may have misreported their dietary intake since this information was collected by questionnaires. In addition, because this is an observational study, residual confounding cannot be ruled out (i.e. that other lifestyle habits which are more common in adults who eat walnuts could contribute to the study findings); and, thus, the results should be interpreted with caution.\n\n###\n\nThis research was supported in part by the California Walnut Commission (CWC). The CWC has supported health-related research on walnuts for more than 25 years. While the CWC does provide funds and/or walnuts for various projects, the actual studies are conducted independently by researchers who design the experiments, interpret the results and write the manuscripts.\n\nAbout California Walnut Commission\n\nThe California Walnut Commission, established in 1987, is funded by mandatory assessments of the growers.

The researchers tested for levels of a blood marker of vitamin B12 and for levels of homocysteine, an amino acid that has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer\'s disease (as well as heart disease and stroke).\n\nB vitamins, including B12 and folate, have been shown to help lower homocysteine levels, so high levels of the amino acid suggest low levels of B12.\n\nHealth.com: 9 foods that may help save your memory\n\nOver the next seven years, 17 study participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer\'s disease. The people with the highest levels of homocysteine at the beginning of the study had the greatest risk of developing the disease. In contrast, each unit increase in the marker of vitamin B12 (known as holotranscobalamin) reduced the risk of developing Alzheimer\'s by 2 percent.\n\nThe relationship between vitamin B12 and Alzheimer\'s risk is ""complex,"" says Dr. Sudha Seshadri, M.D., an associate professor of neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine and the author of an editorial accompanying the study. But, she adds, ""B12 levels, particularly holotranscobalamin levels, likely play a contributory role.""\n\nThe links among Alzheimer\'s risk, homocysteine, and B12 were more pronounced in older individuals, the study found.\n\nHealth.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer\'s disease\n\nBlood levels of folate, which the researchers also measured, were not related to homocysteine levels or Alzheimer\'s risk in this study. Folic acid -- a synthetic version of folate found in many supplements and multivitamins -- has been shown to lower homocysteine in previous studies, but its effect on disease risk is disputed.\n\nA National Institutes of Health panel recently concluded that there are no foods or vitamins that definitively prevent the development of Alzheimer\'s disease, and experts say this study is consistent with the panel\'s recommendations. ""A healthy diet likely remains important,"" Seshadri says. ""The role of supplementation remains unclear.""\n\nHealth.com: Ginkgo doesn\'t work: are there better ways to save your brain?\n\nMaria Carillo, Ph.D., the senior director of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer\'s Association, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, urges caution in interpreting the new findings, especially given that so few study participants developed the disease.\n\n""We do know that vitamin B12 is a huge contributor to lowering homocysteine levels,"" she says. ""Lowering these in general is important for cardiovascular health, and this study strengthens our knowledge about its role in risk for Alzheimer\'s disease.""\n\nDr. Sam Gandy, M.D., the associate director of the Alzheimer\'s Disease Research Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City, says that it may make sense for people to get blood tests to measure their levels of B12 and folate.\n\nHealth.com: How to age-proof your memory\n\nHowever, he says, the study findings may not necessarily translate to people outside Scandinavia.

Along with being persistent, experts like J. Lee Westmaas, strategic director of tobacco control research at the American Cancer Society, recommend trying lots of different approaches to smoke out the leading cause of preventable death. “I would say use as many aids as you can,” he says.\n\nFor those trying to quit, one new quit aid on the horizon will be easily accessed with an internet connection and a smartphone, tablet or computer: tailored emails.\n\nResearch led by Westmaas and published in May in the journal Tobacco Control looked at the effect of sending multiple emails to smokers during a quit attempt that were customized based on information provided by those individuals, such as quit date, their top two reasons for quitting, top five triggers for smoking and intended use of cessation medications. The findings showed that approach yielded quit rates that were higher than for those who received a single, non-tailored email containing links to smoking cessation resources. Self-reported rates of abstinence from smoking at six months after enrollment in the randomized controlled trial were 36 percent in the multiple email group compared with 26.5 percent in the single email group.\n\nWhat’s more – though smokers are encouraged to try different methods of quitting – the research found the emails worked as a stand-alone approach. Westmaas says some emails were tailored based on whether study respondents planned to use nicotine replacement therapy, which has been found to be helpful for those seeking to quit smoking. Those study participants who weren’t planning to use NRT received an email explaining why use of NRT is actually a good thing, he says. Those receiving multiple emails who planned on using NRT got messaging outlining all the different kinds of NRT.\n\n“Interestingly though, when we looked at whether or not people had used NRT, our results were the same. So even when we controlled for use of NRT, we still found an effect of the intervention,” he says – that is, receiving multiple, tailored emails helped people quit smoking regardless. “The intervention was effective whether or not you use nicotine replacement therapy.”\n\nOne of the study’s limitations was that those who participated were generally well-educated. The majority were white, and only 20 percent reported a high school education or less, suggesting the possibility that results may not necessarily be generalizable to less educated or other racial or ethnic groups, the researchers wrote. They suggest that future research should examine how well tailored emails worked for these and other groups, such as cancer survivors or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex groups.\n\nAt present, the email program studied isn’t available to the general public. But Westmaas says the American Cancer Society aims to make a similar program available soon. “We hope that by the beginning of next year we’ll have something ready,” he says, adding that it could be earlier depending on the success of efforts to secure funding for the program.\n\nIn the meantime, those who wish to get support for quit attempts but prefer to receive it in a way that fits with an on-the-go lifestyle can opt to receive text messages to support a quit attempt as well – like through smokefree.gov, a website created by the Tobacco Control Research Branch of the National Cancer Institute. NCI also offers QuitPal, a free app for iPhone or iPad, for a quit assist. The app has numerous interactive features, such as tracking smoking habits with a calendar and providing tips to deal with cravings. It also allows users to connect with social media, where they can see loved ones' personalized video messages to support their progress.\n\nThe point, however support is provided, is to deliver it in a way that best suits the individual. “It seems like people have preferences for how they want to receive information, especially about quitting,” Westmaas says.\n\nWhile some gravitate toward group smoking cessation classes, for example, others prefer to talk one-on-one with a counselor or on a smoking quitline, like 1-800-QUIT-NOW (also affiliated with NCI). Others prefer less intrapersonal interaction, and technology provides a way to reach more people trying to quit. Some people in rural areas may not have access to smoking cessation programs, says Mary LeVasseur, manager of community health and wellness at Lancaster General Health, who’s responsible for the health system’s tobacco prevention and treatment programs.\n\nThe email approach is not meant to replace other options for quitting, Westmaas emphasizes, but rather to provide an additional one.\n\nExperts point out, in particular, that medications and counseling in combination can be a powerful combination – even more effective than either alone. However, medications Chantix and Zyban are also associated with risks ranging from depressed mood, hostility and aggression to suicidal thoughts. “Most of the medication options and the nicotine-replacement options are fairly well tolerated” and effective, Bonne says. But experts say its important to keep doctors in the loop when issues arise to determine if medications or NRT should be stopped.\n\nIf using NRT to break a tobacco addiction, talk with a health provider if you experience nausea, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, fast or irregular heartbeat, “mouth problems” with the lozenge or gum or redness or swelling of the skin around an NRT patch that doesn’t go away, the Food and Drug Administration recommends. Taken by mouth, the lozenges can cause a warm or tingling sensation; and users are urged to seek medical attention right away if they experience a severe allergic reaction – which may be marked by rash, itching, swelling of the mouth or difficulty breathing – or other serious side effects.\n\nWith any attempt to quit, experts say it’s important to take stock of even small successes – like not smoking for a short period, even if it doesn’t last. “We look at tobacco dependence as a chronic disease. So that’s the most important thing – knowing that people go through many different cycles of abstinence and remission,” LeVasseur says.""]","An informative, detailed description of a smoking cessation study that places the results nicely in context.","This story by U.S. News & World Report highlights the results of a trial of a digital aid to quit smoking: tailored emails. Researchers sent multiple encouraging messages, which also included links to information on how to quit, to willing smokers, then followed up six months later to see if the recipients had resumed smoking at lower rates than participants who received a single non-tailored email. The story did a good job of explaining how the study worked, seemed to grasp the quality of the evidence, and went out of the way to describe multiple alternative methods to quitting smoking (and their risks). However, the article would have been stronger had it had described previous research into email-based interventions, and compared the benefits of multiple emails to other effective approaches. We learn that more tailored emails are better than a single non-tailored email, but how do the quit rates seen here compare, numerically, with other approaches that smokers might try?

Nearly 3 million people in the United States have the condition. It is often marked by elevated internal eye pressure, called intraocular pressure. Medicated eye drops taken daily or twice daily can lower internal eye pressure to help prevent damage to the optic nerve. But studies show that many patients do not take glaucoma eye drops as directed due to factors such as forgetfulness or physical limitations like arthritis. 1 Some studies show that half of patients stop taking their prescription glaucoma eye drops after a year, leaving them vulnerable to vision loss. 2\n\nResearchers are tackling this challenge of medication adherence with new drug delivery methods. One technology involves a thin silicone ring suffused with medication that slowly releases over time. An ophthalmologist fits the patient with the ring. No surgery is required. The ring is designed to be replaced by an ophthalmologist every six months. This eliminates the need for glaucoma patients to regularly put in medicated eye drops themselves.\n\nOphthalmologists at 10 sites nationwide tested the ring in a phase 2 clinical trial on patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the study, 64 patients received the topical ocular insert containing the glaucoma drug bimatoprost. They were also supplied artificial tears. The control group of 66 patients wore an insert treated with no drug but twice a day used 0.5 percent timolol drops, the regulatory benchmark for glaucoma drugs. Eye pressure in the bimatoprost group fell 3.2 to 6.4 mmHg over six months, in comparison to 4.2 to 6.4 mmHG for the timolol group. Overall, eye pressure decreased in the group wearing the bimatoprost ring by about 20 percent from the initial measurements over six months.\n\nAuthors said the device was well-tolerated and safe, with a high retention rate of 89 percent for both groups at six months. The ring became dislodged in 15 patients but was replaced each time, allowing therapy to continue. Some patients experienced itchiness and eye redness, which is not unusual for patients taking glaucoma medication.\n\n""In making effective treatments easier for patients, the hope is that we can reduce vision loss from glaucoma, and possibly other diseases,"" said study author James D. Brandt, M.D., director of the UC Davis Medical Center Glaucoma Service. ""What is exciting is that this is just one of several sustained-release drug delivery methods designed to help patients who have trouble taking daily eye drops.""\n\nA phase 3 study of a larger group of patients is expected to begin later in 2016. The authors noted the device could also be used for non-glaucoma medications, with potential applications for dry eye, allergies and inflammation. In addition, the non-invasive nature of the device and its relatively large surface area make this technology a potential candidate for delivering multiple ocular drugs at once, further reducing the burden of self-administration on patients.\n\n""Six-month IOP Reduction with a Topical Bimatoprost Ocular Insert: Results of a Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Study,"" Brandt, et al.

1157,story_reviews_01059,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/4074/,2011-07-01 04:00:00,Who should get screened for lung cancer?,"['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Using chest scans to screen for lung cancer in people who’ve never smoked and have no symptoms might help catch cancers early and decrease the disease’s death toll, suggests a new study from Japan.\n\nBut experts say the findings likely don’t apply in non-Asian countries, where the majority of all lung cancers are found in people who smoke — and where using computed tomography (CT) scans to screen for lung cancer in smokers has recently been a controversial topic.\n\nMoreover, they warn that while regular screening might help doctors catch cancer earlier, it also comes with a high price tag and added risks to patients.\n\nCT scanning uses X-rays and computers to produce a clearer image than traditional X-ray techniques, but CT also uses higher radiation doses to generate those images.\n\nEverybody agrees that CT “does find the early stage lung cancer,” said Dr. Heidi Roberts, a lung cancer researcher from Women’s College Hospital, Toronto who wasn’t involved in the new study. Early-stage cancer is easier to treat and has a higher survival rate.\n\nThe new study provides further evidence of that. Researchers led by Dr. Ryoichi Kondo of Shinshu University Hospital in Matsumoto looked back at outcomes for close to 500 non-smoking lung cancer patients whose cancer was caught by CT scan screening, or by standard X-ray screening — another strategy for catching cancer early — or when patients came into the doctor with lung symptoms.\n\nMost of the tumors found via CT scans were small, whereas those found through X-ray screening or in patients with symptoms were more often further advanced, according to the findings published in the journal Lung Cancer.\n\nFive years after their diagnosis, 95 percent of people whose cancers were found through a CT scan were still alive, compared to 73 percent diagnosed with an X-ray and 40 percent of patients who had not been screened and whose symptoms led to discovery their disease.\n\nEast Asian countries are more likely to regularly screen non-smokers for lung cancer because biological differences seem to put Asians at a higher risk than other non-smokers, researchers explained.\n\nNon-smokers without symptoms generally are not screened for lung cancer in the U.S.\n\nThere and in Canada, the lung cancer debate has centered around how often to screen smokers, and until what age screening should be done, Roberts said.\n\nIn another study published by Kondo and colleagues — this one looking at lung cancer screening in smokers — five-year survival rates were also highest in those screened with CT scans.\n\nThat’s consistent with the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial in the U.S., which in November released data — published online in the New England Journal of Medicine last week — showing that 20 percent fewer middle-aged heavy smokers died of lung cancer when they were screened annually with a CT scan compared to a standard, less detailed chest X-ray.\n\nLung cancer kills more people in the U.S. than any other cancer — over 150,000 each year.\n\nThe problem with frequent screening is not only its cost — CT scans typically run a few hundred dollars each — but that each scan exposes a person to radiation, which also slightly increases cancer risks over time with repeated scans.\n\nAnd screening comes with an inherent risk of false-positives — scans which suggest a lung cancer that turns out not to be there.\n\nDr. Christine Berg, one of the leaders of the U.S. screening studies, said that generally about a quarter of chest CT scans show some kind of abnormality — but 96 percent of those abnormal scans turn out not to be lung cancer. While doctors ruled out cancer, those patients would have undergone further tests, sometimes including biopsies, which can cause complications including infection and bleeding.\n\nAnd for some patients, “if you really weren’t going to benefit from the screening...that complication is something you may not have faced,” Berg said. “Those are some of the things I worry about.”\n\nHer study showed that 300 middle-aged smokers would need to be screened with CT scans to prevent one death from lung cancer.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally-supported expert panel, has said there isn’t enough evidence for it to recommend screening for lung cancer in symptom-free people using CT scans or other methods.\n\nBerg and Roberts both told Reuters Health that more research is needed to see if there might be hints in the blood or genes of smokers that could tell doctors which had the highest risk for lung cancer — and which would get the most out of routine CT screening.\n\n“We now have a technology that can detect (lung cancer) early enough to make some impact,” Berg said. But, “it’s not a home run, and it clearly has these limitations.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/iLARSq Lung Cancer, online June 12, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">In ending with an expert’s summary that lung CT scanning is “not a home run” with clear limitations, this story touches ’em all and hits its own home run in addressing our criteria. </span>","In the same week that new data were published by the US National Lung Screening Trial – subject of some badly flawed national news coverage – here’s a story on a different lung screening trial in Japan.

They showed that in people with very early AD (pre-dementia), a once-daily nutritional drink* designated a ""food for special medical purposes"" can help to reduce brain shrinkage - particularly in the hippocampal brain area, the part of the brain that helps store short-term memories for long-term retrieval. And for those who start the intervention early and consumed it regularly, it can help to conserve memory and the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. The drink contains ""Fortasyn Connect"", a specific combination of fatty acids, vitamins and other nutrients.\n\nThis is the first time a randomised, double-blind, clinical trial has shown that a nutritional intervention can help to conserve the ability of patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) to carry out everyday tasks, such as paying bills, or finding your way around, as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) - a combined measure for the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. This is important because those with very early AD (pre-dementia) currently have no approved, available pharmacological options.\n\nThe study did not find a significant benefit in broad cognitive function (the study primary endpoint). Cognitive decline over the study period was less than originally expected when it was designed ten years ago, so differences found between the two groups were too small to be statistically significant. Project coordinator Professor Tobias Hartmann, Saarland University Germany, explained that this is the most likely reason the primary endpoint was not met.\n\nProfessor Hilkka Soininen, Professor in Neurology MD, PhD from the University of Eastern Finland, who headed the clinical trial as part of the LipiDiDiet project, said: ""Today\'s results are extremely valuable as they bring us closer to understanding the impact of nutritional interventions on very early AD (pre-dementia) which we are now better at diagnosing but unable to treat due to a lack of approved pharmaceutical options.\n\nThe LipiDiDiet study illustrates that this nutritional intervention can help to conserve brain tissue and also memory and patients\' ability to perform everyday tasks - possibly the most troubling aspects of the disease. We look forward to the results of subsequent analyses and the six year extension study which will provide further insights"".\n\nThe clinical trial, headed by Professor Hilkka Soininen is part of a large EC project (LipiDiDiet) to explore the therapeutic and preventative impact of nutrition on neuronal and cognitive performance in ageing, AD and vascular dementia. LipiDiDiet is funded by the seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission (EC) and coordinated by Professor Hartmann, Saarland University in Germany.\n\nFortasyn Connect was selected by a consortium of leading researchers from 19 European institutes, for this 24-month, randomised, controlled, double-blind, multicentre study involving 311 patients - on the basis of its results in a previous EU project (LipiDiet).\n\nNearly 47 million people have Alzheimer\'s or a related dementia for which there is currently no cure.[2] This number is expected to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050.[2]\n\nStudy details\n\nThe trial was the first to investigate the impact of Fortasyn Connect on patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) who were randomised to receive either Fortasyn Connect or an iso-caloric control drink once daily.\n\nThe primary outcome parameter was selected to assess the effect on cognitive function (a broad measure of thinking) during 24 months intake of Fortasyn Connect compared with a control product. This was a cognitive composite score consisting of the CERAD 10-word immediate recall, delayed recall and recognition, category fluency and letter digit substitution test.\n\nSecondary outcome parameters were brain volumes (total hippocampal, whole-brain & ventricular volumes), the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Neuropsychological Test Battery composite scores: episodic memory, executive function/working memory composite and a complete composite score consisting of 16 subtests, progression to (AD) dementia, blood and CSF biomarkers, tolerance and safety.\n\nNo significant difference was observed for the cognitive composite score. Predefined analyses showed significant differences between active and control study groups for hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy, and favourable effects for CDR Sum of Boxes and episodic memory (both were most pronounced in patients with high baseline cognition with regular intake). Analyses are ongoing for progression to (AD) dementia and blood and CSF biomarkers.\n\nTobias Hartmann, the project\'s coordinator, said, ""We have known for a while that diet can reduce the risk of developing dementia. Indeed, certain nutrients have been found to have a neuroprotective effect on the brain. However translating this into an effective intervention hasn\'t been easy because single nutrients simply aren\'t powerful enough to fight a disease like Alzheimer\'s alone. Today\'s clinical trial results have shown that the key is combining certain nutrients, in order to increase their effect.\n\n""This is exciting because it shows that in the absence of effective drug options, we really have found something that can help slow down some of the most distressing symptoms in very early AD (pre-dementia); especially in those who started the intervention early. Indeed those patients who have lost the least cognitive function, have the most to gain.""\n\nNotes to editors*\n\nAbout LipiDiDiet\n\nLipiDiDiet is an innovative project whose remit is dementia prevention related research.

Coverage of that study mentioned prominently that the nutritional drink was made by Dannon, the yogurt company. Something that tastes good and also helps you remember where you put your keys? What’s not to like? But this update to that study received a bewilderingly opaque treatment in this news release. We have to wonder why the release avoided spelling out cost, benefits, risks, and the overall contours of the study. There is a lot of space spent on the organizations involved in the study and far too little on what they actually did and, most importantly, found.
The release notes that the research was presented as a “late-breaking presentation” at an international medical meeting but offered no easy way to access the research. The release directs us to the LipiDiDiet website for more information on the study, but there we are told:
“15 October 2015

Over time, taste and smell abnormalities (TSA) can lead to a loss of appetite and anorexic behaviors, compromising patients\' ability to recuperate from the disease.\n\nIn a new paper published in the journal Food & Function, Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences researchers Susan Duncan and Aili Wang investigated the feasibility of lactoferrin, a highly bioactive protein found in saliva and milk, as a treatment for TSA. Their findings could bring relief to millions of patients undergoing cancer treatment.\n\n""The underlying molecular mechanisms of TSA are not well-understood,"" said Duncan, associate director of the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station and a professor in the Department of Food Science and Technology. ""The prevailing symptom described by patients undergoing chemotherapy is a persistent metallic flavor or aftertaste, with or without food intake. This can last for hours, weeks, or even months after the completion of treatments.""\n\nAs a consequence, cancer patients suffer poor appetite, weight loss, depression, and diminished nutrition, all of which are detrimental to recovery. Although TSA is widespread and a frequent complaint of cancer patients, until now, there have been no established therapies that reliably prevent or treat this problem.\n\n""Our research shows that daily lactoferrin supplementation elicits changes in the salivary protein profiles in cancer patients - changes that may be influential in helping to protect taste buds and odor perception,"" said Duncan. ""By suggesting lactoferrin as a dietary supplement, we can reduce TSA for many patients, restoring their ability to enjoy foods during a time in which nutrition can play a key role in their recovery. This research could help us develop TSA-targeted biomarkers and strategies for improving quality of life during chemotherapy. Cancer patients and their supporting family and friends may again find comfort in enjoying a meal together. ""\n\nThe transdisciplinary team, including William Ray, Department of Biochemistry; Andrea Dietrich, of the Charles E. Via Jr. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the College of Engineering; and Glenn Lesser, from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, previously identified the role of lactoferrin, a specific milk protein, in diminishing the metallic flavor stimulated by chemotherapy medications. The substance is well-known as a first-line defense, aiding the body\'s immune response, but little is known about its ability to impact salivary proteins. Their most recent study builds on the previous body of work through the application of lactoferrin supplements in treating taste and smell abnormalities.\n\nThe team\'s findings will make it possible for cancer patients to taste foods properly and to enjoy a healthier appetite, enabling more optimal nutrition during a critical period of recovery. Lactoferrin supplementation also enhances the expression of salivary immune proteins, which may help reduce oxidative stress and resulting side effects. Oral infections, such as thrush, also may be diminished.\n\n###']",The release offers speculation but no data to describe lactoferrin (a protein found in milk) benefits.,"The very preliminary study mentioned in this news release relies on only 12 cancer patients filling out an unvalidated questionnaire about whether taking lactoferrin supplements improved their sense of taste and smell.
This is a weak news release about a weak observational study  because it provides no supporting data, never mentions how small the study is, and doesn’t explain the basic design or multiple limitations of the study.
To then write a headline broadly claiming alleviation of chemotherapy side effects and state the “findings could bring relief to millions of patients undergoing cancer treatment” is a textbook example of overreaching and unjustified hype with significant potential for misleading — not “bringing relief” to millions.

Both tend to be diagnosed late, because the symptoms are ambiguous, meaning the five-year survival rate for these two types of cancer is only 15%.\n\nThe new research, involving more than 300 patients, showed that the test could diagnose cancer with an overall accuracy of 85%.\n\nDr Sheraz Markar, an NIHR Clinical Trials Fellow from Imperial College London, under the supervision of Professor George Hanna, told the Congress: ""At present the only way to diagnose oesophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy. This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications.\n\n""A breath test could be used as a non-invasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival.""\n\nThe trial was based on the results of previous research that suggested differences in the levels of specific chemicals (butyric, pentanoic and hexanoic acids, butanal, and decanal) between patients with stomach or oesophageal cancer and patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms without cancer. The new research aimed to test whether this \'chemical signature\' that seemed to typify cancer could be the basis of a diagnostic test.\n\nIn the new study, the research team collected breath samples from 335 people at St Mary\'s Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust; University College London Hospital; and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London. Of these, 163 had been diagnosed with stomach or oesophageal cancer and 172 showed no evidence of cancer when they had an endoscopy.\n\nAll the samples were analysed with a technique called selected ion flow-tube mass spectrometry, which is able to accurately measure small amounts of different chemicals in mixtures of gases such as breath.\n\nResearchers measured the levels of the five chemicals in each sample to see which ones matched to the \'chemical signature\' that indicated cancer.\n\nThe results showed that the test was 85% accurate overall, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 81%. This means that not only was the breath test good at picking up those who had cancer (sensitivity), it was also good at correctly identifying who did not have cancer (specificity).\n\nDr Markar said: ""Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the oesophagus and stomach, and which do not. However, these findings must be validated in a larger sample of patients before the test could be used in the clinic.""\n\nOver the next three years, the researchers will continue with a larger trial, using the test with patients who are being given an endoscopy for gastrointestinal symptoms but not yet diagnosed with cancer. This will assess the ability of the test to pick up cases within a group that is likely to contain only a small percentage of cancers.\n\nThe team is also working on breath tests for other types of cancer, such as colorectal and pancreatic, which could be used as first-line tests in general practice surgeries.\n\n###']",Screening for cancer is different than distinguishing established cancer from non-cancer. The release needed to be a lot more clear on this difference.,"This news release about a breath test to detect stomach and esophageal cancers discusses the potential benefits of a screening test that could distinguish useful indications of early-stage, but serious, cancer in the breaths of average people –.if future research shows it can work in the real world. But that’s a bit off track from what the researchers tested. The underlying trial merely showed that in most cases breath analysis could distinguish between people who were already known to have stomach or esophageal cancer (advanced in most cases) with people who did not have any signs of cancer.
The release did note at the end that researchers have yet to study whether this breath analysis can detect cancers among people in the general population. That’s an important point and one that would have been good to emphasize earlier in the release. The release gave only the briefest nod to the existence of numerous other breath tests for cancer that are being studied and didn’t explain how this particular research compares to other efforts.

Maybe.\n\nResearchers conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 40 postmenopausal women ages 45 to 65 with high blood pressure. Half ate 22 grams of freeze-dried blueberry powder (equivalent to a cup of blueberries) daily for eight weeks. The others consumed an identical-looking and tasting placebo.\n\nThe study, in The Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, found that those who ate the blueberry preparation saw an average 5.1 percent decrease in systolic blood pressure (the top number) and a 6.3 percent decrease in diastolic pressure. Levels of nitric oxide, known to be involved in relaxing and widening blood vessels, increased significantly in the blueberry eaters. There were no significant changes in the placebo group.\n\nThe improvement, the scientists write, was moderate compared with that of blood pressure medicines. But, they say, eating blueberries in larger amounts or for longer periods could increase the effect.\n\nThe lead author, Sarah A. Johnson, a postdoctoral researcher at Florida State University, said she saw no reason for people to radically change their diet, but that if they are not eating blueberries, they might want to try them. “There is something very special about the composition of blueberries that is responsible for their effect on blood pressure,” she said. “Other fruits and plant extracts have not produced the same result.”']",This story asks if a cup of blueberries can keep the doctor away. The answer should have been much clearer.,"Blueberries are a healthy alternative to many foods that Americans consume, but are they a potential alternative to drug therapy for individuals with hypertension? That’s the message readers may take away from this New York Times brief, which suggests — based on a study of people with high blood pressure — that blueberries could help “keep the doctor away.”
In truth, we really can’t tell much of anything from a study that included a mere 40 people who took blueberry powder for only 8 weeks. So we think the story should have been more circumspect about what conclusions we might be able to take away from this research.
Don’t misunderstand us: we realize that briefs like this aren’t always going to merit a 5-star rating on our reviews (although many shorter stories have done so). But we do hope that they’ll use language that reflects the quality of evidence being reported on. Maybe there is “something very special about the composition of blueberries,” as the quoted researcher suggests, but we’d like to see more proof before canceling our next doctor’s appointment.

I’ll drink to that!,"['In a study suggesting that red wine might be the next big thing in breast cancer prevention, a study has found that women who drank just under two servings of red wine daily experienced hormonal changes that mimic the effects of a drug used to prevent malignant breast tumors from coming back.\n\nThe study, published Friday in the Journal of Women’s Health, found that consuming the same amount of white wine did not have the same effect in premenopausal women participating in the study.\n\nWomen intent on warding off breast cancer have been warned about alcohol consumption: as recently as November, a study found that women who consumed as few as three servings of alcohol a week increased their risk of developing the disease, which strikes one in eight American women at some point in life.\n\nWhite wine and other alcoholic beverages are believed to promote the conversion of androgens--""male hormones” such as testosterone, which circulate in all women’s blood--into estrogen. And the greater a woman’s lifetime exposure to estrogen--whether her own or estrogen that comes from medication or environmental sources--the higher her risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut red wine acts differently, the present study found. Instead of promoting the conversion of androgens to estrogen in a woman’s body, red wine appears to block that process. In that sense, it acts more like a class of drug called aromatase inhibitors, which are prescribed to most women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer to prevent recurrences.\n\nIt’s not the alcohol in red wine that appears to conjure such magic. It’s the phytochemicals, which also are found in grapes, grape juice and grape seed extract. Resveratrol, one of the phytochemicals found plentifully in red wine, has been linked to a host of disease-preventing processes.\n\nResearchers led by a team from Cedars-Sinai’s Heart Institute and Medical Center found that study participants who drank eight ounces of red wine daily (the equivalent of almost two servings at five ounces per serving) showed a significantly different mix of seven sex hormones than those who drank the same amount of white wine. Among the red wine drinkers, estrogen levels were lower and androgen levels were higher.\n\nThe current study was small--36 women, with an average age of 36, participated. Each drank eight ounces nightly of Cabernet Sauvignon wine for most of a single menstrual cycle, then drank no alcohol for a little over a week and then drank eight ounces of Chardonnay nightly for roughly the next 21 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe authors asserted this was the first rigorous study to find that red wine is a “nutritional aromatase inhibitor in healthy premenopausal women.” Another study has found that women who drank more red wine showed less breast density on mammograms--an emerging marker for breast cancer risk-- than those who drank other forms of alcohol.\n\nL’chaim!']",We’re always going to balk at ,"It’s ironic that we just published two blog pieces last week that mentioned surrogate markers (both links appear in our comments below), and along comes this story trumpeting a finding that involved only surrogate markers – without any of the expected caveats.

Patz, Jr., M.D., the James and Alice Chen Professor of Radiology at Duke and lead author of a study published online March 21, 2016 in The Lancet Oncology journal. ""Not screening patients annually could save millions in health care costs and spare patients the radiation exposure and the downstream effects of false positive screenings.""\n\nPatz and colleagues analyzed data from the National Lung Screening Trial, a large prospective study that randomly assigned former smokers to either receive three annual low-dose CT scans or three chest radiographs for the early detection of lung cancer. Patients were ages 55-74 who had smoked for the equivalent of 30 years (one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years, etc.).\n\nThe researchers identified study participants in the CT-scan group whose initial screening was negative. They then compared those patients to other CT-scan recipients whose screenings detected an abnormality to assess any differences in lung cancer incidence and lung cancer-specific deaths.\n\nOf the initial 19,066 participants with a negative initial LDCT scan, 444 (2 percent) were diagnosed with lung cancer at the time of the last available follow-up. In the first year after a negative screen and before the scheduled first annual screen, 17 patients (0.09 percent of all initial negative LDCT participants) were diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nAn additional 75 patients (0.4 percent of the initial negative group) were diagnosed with lung cancer between the first and second annual screening. The incidence of lung cancer at the first screen among those who were initially negative was 0.34 percent, compared to 1 percent of patients who were diagnosed during the baseline screening.\n\nThe researchers determined that eliminating the first annual screening after the initial negative test might have resulted in, at most, an additional 28 lung cancer deaths in the LDCT group (186 vs. 212 deaths per 100,000 per years) over the course of the study.\n\n""Our analysis suggests that annual screens may not be warranted for patients who have had an initial negative scan, and future risk prediction and cost-effectiveness models could incorporate these data to improve screening guidelines,"" Patz said.\n\nHe added that improving the accuracy of LDCT screening for lung cancer would also significantly reduce the number of annual screens. Nearly 40 percent of LDCT patients in the National Lung Screening Trial had false positives sometime during the seven years the study examined\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Patz, study authors include Erin Greco, Constantine Gatsonis, Paul Pinsky, Barnett S. Kramer, and Denise R.

Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that’s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial—and how to protect them. A recent study published in The BMJ adds to the growing evidence that fiber might be a critical gut-nourishing nutrient. (Unfortunately, less than 3% of Americans eat the government-recommended amount daily.)\n\n“You really hold the reins to guiding this community [of bacteria] through the choices you make,” says Justin L. Sonnenburg, PhD, associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine and author of The Good Gut. Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria.\n\nThe authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species: Akkermansia muciniphila—a strain that’s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice. They wrangled a group of 49 overweight and obese adults, took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six-week calorie-restricted diet (between 1,500-1,800 calories per day) while increasing their fiber intake. The diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally. They kept a food journal throughout, and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue.\n\nThe people who had more Akkermansia in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet, compared to the people with less of the bacterium. Both groups of people lost the same amount of weight, but the high-Akkermansia group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others, says study author Patrice D. Cani, PhD, professor and group leader of the Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group at Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. “We discovered that the patients who exhibited higher amounts of Akkermansia were the patients who had a very strong improvement in cholesterol, in glycemia, in waist to hip ratio and also a reduction in different parameters in both cardiovascular disease and risk factors.”\n\nHigher levels of Akkermansia, the findings suggest, seem to have favorable effects on health.\n\nThe good news is that your initial Akkermansia levels are not your fate. People who started out with lower stores of Akkermansia had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. You can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber, Cani’s research suggests, which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria.\n\nNow, Cani says he is working on an experiment with obese and diabetic patients to administer Akkermansia alone, without any dietary modifications, to see what effect it has on insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors. “If we can improve these different parameters, that would be something great,” he says.\n\nGet The Brief.

It’s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans, but Sonnenburg thinks it might. “We start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic,” he says.\n\nLoading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn’t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut. Studies done on single fibers—those, like inulin, which are added to foods—haven’t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods. “All of the vegetables we’re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines, these are all filled with fiber, and filled with a diversity of fiber, and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota,” Sonnenburg says.\n\nNuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber—as are vegetables. “You can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you, you can feel really satisfied and full,” Sonnenburg says. “I find that a really nice way to eat—just kind of gorging myself on plant material.”\n\nWrite to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com.""]","This story did a reasonable job of covering an individual study, but the piece raises questions about whether this early-stage research was worth writing about at all.","The story focuses on a June paper from the journal BMJ, which looked at the role that a particular bacterium found in the human gut (Akkermansia muciniphila) may play in influencing metabolic health and reports that a high-fiber diet can influence an individual’s population of A. muciniphila. The story does a good job of explaining what happened in the study and providing outside expert commentary on the role of fiber in regulating the immune system. It also communicates what we think is a good science-based message about the value of a diet rich in a variety of plant foods. But the story doesn’t explain for readers the many limitations of the study or the fact that there was significant variability in how a fiber-rich diet affected an individual’s A. muciniphila levels. And the number of qualifiers needed in discussing the study raise the question of why this study was written about at all. Why not wait for the additional research that’s needed? There is a lot of speculation here about how this bacterium might impact obesity, with a paucity of evidence to back it up.

Not even at the beach in July.\n\nToenail fungus causes nails to become thick, yellow and brittle in a way that looks pretty ugly and can be painful. Sufferers can spend years and hundreds of dollars trying to clear the infection with drugs, topical treatments and home remedies, sometimes to no avail. It tends to be a cosmetic issue for the younger set and a pain issue for older folks.\n\n“The problem is huge. It is bigger than you can imagine,” says Washington podiatrist Stephen J. Kominsky. “I would say 70 percent of the patients who come into my office have fungal infections on their toenails.”\n\nThere may be hope. Podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection — or wastes their patients’ money because it doesn’t work, depending on whom you ask.\n\nThe treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient’s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure. The nails aren’t immediately clear after the treatment, which takes up to an hour; the patient must wait for the fungus-free nails to grow out.\n\nLast year, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the first laser, PinPointe, for “temporary increase of clear nail” in patients with onychomycosis, the medical term for a fungal infection of the nail. The FDA cleared a second one, GenesisPlus, in April. Practitioners have been using other lasers on toenail fungus since about 2009.\n\n‘No side effects’\n\nKominsky has treated 400 to 500 patients with the PinPointe laser. Compared with oral medication, he says, “the odds of success are better with the laser; plus, there’s no side effects.”\n\nThe most common oral treatment, Lamisil, works for about two out of three patients, according to Lamisil’s FDA-approved prescribing information, but it has been associated with rare cases of serious liver problems. Other potential side effects include diarrhea, headache, rashes and changes in taste. According to Lamisil’s manufacturer, Novartis, the relapse rate is 15 percent one year after completing treatment.\n\nIn one small study about laser treatment for toenail fungus, which appeared last year in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association, “26 eligible toes (ten mild, seven moderate, and nine severe)” were treated with a laser produced by Nomir Medical Technologies, which is still seeking FDA approval. After six months, 85 percent of the toenails had improved.\n\n“I never use the term ‘cured’ with toenail fungus,” Kominsky says. “With a cure, people think there’s no chance for a recurrence. In this case, there is a chance.”\n\nEven John Strisower, the founder of PinPointe USA, says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment.\n\nRoutes of infection\n\nResearch done by PinPointe, which is based in Chico, Calif., identified more than 100 organisms, including fungi, yeast, mold and bacteria, that work together to cause toenail fungus.\n\nThere’s no one route of infection, but sources include pedicures and locker room showers. Fungi love moist, dark environments such as wet shoes, Kominsky says, so people such as lifeguards, landscapers and fishermen are particularly susceptible. Shoes are the reason why toenail fungus is much more common than fingernail fungus, which can also occur.\n\nThe elderly are more likely to have toenail fungus than younger people because they have had more years to be exposed to the infection and their immune systems can’t always fight it off, according to Washington podiatrist Lee Firestone. He estimates that about half of people over 70 have toenail fungus.\n\nLast year, Americans spent $354 million on prescription and over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company.\n\nFirestone typically recommends oral medication for patients with toenail fungus.\n\n“I think the laser can improve the appearance of the nail, but it’s only temporary and it needs to be used again and again to maintain that improvement,” says Firestone, who doesn’t use the lasers in his practice. “I’ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long-term success.”\n\nVinegar won’t work\n\nFirestone also says that over-the-counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can’t penetrate the nail root. Home remedies such as tea tree oil, bleach and vinegar also don’t work, he says.\n\nYet even a superficial improvement would be an improvement for many.\n\nRichard, a retiree in Fairfax who did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus, got a laser treatment on all 10 toes in April 2010, and he says his nails were fully cleared of the yellowed, thickened look after a year. To prevent reinfection, he has purchased all new socks and a SteriShoe, a $130 device that uses ultraviolet light to sanitize shoes, at his podiatrist’s recommendation. He has also turned to what he calls “an old wives’ tale” that he read about in a newspaper column: slathering Vicks VapoRub on his toes.\n\n“My doctor said, ‘Listen, it’s not a prescribed treatment, but if it works for you, for heaven’s sake, do it.’ ”']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Loaded with anecdotes and light on facts, this story serves as an advertisement for one local podiatrist and for an uNPRoven laser treatment.</span>","Near the end of this story, we meet a man named “Richard,” and describes him as “a retiree in Fairfax who did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus”.

Impaired insulin sensitivity is one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is associated with age and obesity and happens when the body can’t properly convert blood sugar into energy.\n\nThe researchers did two brief sleep experiments. On one occasion, the volunteers were permitted just 4.5 hours of rest for four nights, followed by two evenings of extended sleep that amounted to 9.7 hours on average. On another occasion, the same men were allowed to sleep 8.5 hours for four nights.\n\nAfter the four nights of sleep deprivation, the volunteers’ insulin sensitivity had fallen by 23 percent and their bodies had started to produce extra insulin. But when researchers checked again after two nights of extended rest, the men’s insulin sensitivity, and the amount of insulin their bodies produced, had returned to normal, mirroring what was seen during the portion of the experiment when the volunteers consistently got a good nights’ rest.\n\nThe volunteers were given a calorie-controlled diet to limit the potential for their food and drink choices to influence the outcomes. In the real world, when people don’t get enough sleep they tend to overeat, which may limit how much results from this lab experiment might happen in reality, the authors note in a report scheduled for publication in the journal Diabetes Care.\n\n“The results from the present study are unlikely to be fully reflective of what may occur in persons who are older, overweight or obese, or have other potent risk factors for diabetes,” said James Gangwisch, a researcher at Columbia University who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\nChronically sleep-deprived people are more likely to develop other health problems, though, ranging from obesity to high blood pressure to cognitive deficits, the study authors point out.\n\n“By catching up on sleep on the weekends, people are reducing average extent and severity of the effects of sleep deprivation,” Gangwisch added by email. “Ideally, we would all get sufficient sleep on a nightly basis.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1DDtd9j Diabetes Care, released January 18, 2016.']","A decent enough job of reporting on a small observational study, but our reviewers questioned whether the study was worth covering at all.","This article describes results of a very small observational study suggesting some tantalizing links between sleep and diabetes risk. But it’s probably fair to say that this article, although it pretty accurately reflects the proffered data and does a solid job of pointing out study limitations, may have served readers better by not being written. The notion that sleep deprivation is linked epidemiologically to temporary insulin resistance has been reported in animal and human observational studies for more than a decade. The confounding factors — obesity, overeating, sleep apnea —  are well known. The scope of the study was acknowledged to be extremely limited and perhaps unmoored from what “might happen in reality,” and it appears that at best, the observational letter to the editor on which the article is based adds only two possible and very preliminary new pieces of information to what is known: it did control for calorie intake, but only over a very few weeks of observation; and there is a slim bit of evidence that “catch up” sleep after four nights of sleep deprivation may improve insulin sensitivity by 23 percent. In sum, although the article states correctly that the study “doesn’t prove that catching up on sleep will prevent diabetes” or that sleep deprivation actually does increase diabetes risk, it doesn’t add much beyond that of a decade of similar investigations.

The device alone reduced that to about one seizure a year. And she hasn\'t had any seizures since she added low doses of a medication more than 18 months ago.\n\nThe device is appealing because it doesn\'t require surgery, doesn\'t have side effects and is very easy to use, Rees says. She wears her device while she sleeps.\n\n""For me, all it involved was putting two gel pads above my eyebrows, one on each eyebrow,"" she says. The device causes ""a slight tingling sensation"" on her skin, she says.\n\nResearchers believe electrical pulses can act like a sort of pacemaker in the brain, heading off the chaotic ""electrical storms"" that cause epileptic seizures. And the trigeminal nerve stimulator is not the first time researchers have used electrical pulses to prevent seizures.\n\nIn 2005, the FDA approved a device that stimulates another nerve that leads to the brain — the vagus nerve. But stimulating the vagus nerve requires surgery to implant a device near the collarbone.\n\nThe trigeminal nerve stimulator, in contrast, never penetrates the skin and is powered by an external device about the size of a large cell phone, DeGiorgio says.\n\nAnd DeGiorgio says he\'s found an interesting benefit to trigeminal nerve stimulation.

Its path, extending nearly three decades from the first studies, demonstrates not only potential benefits but also some of the hurdles in the hunt within nature\'s bounty for drugs of the future.\n\nEisai Co.\'s Halaven, approved for treating late-stage breast cancer, is derived from a substance in a Japanese black sponge. Yasunori Saito, Ph.D.\n\nSecret Sources 1. Quinine, made from bark of the cinchona tree, has been used for centuries to treat malaria. 2. The chemical salicylic acid, found in willow bark, was the basis for the development of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). 3. Cyclosporin, isolated from soil samples, is an immunesuppressant used to prevent transplanted-organ rejection. 4. The diabetes drug Byetta, approved in 2005, derives from a hormone of the Gila monster, a lizard of the southwest U.S. 5. Taxol, a staple of chemotherapy, comes from the Pacific yew tree.\n\nPrimitive creatures developed many clever ways to kill each other after billions of years of evolution, and some can be turned to human use. ""Weapons of mass destruction are alive and well on a coral reef,"" says David Newman of the National Cancer Institute, who has studied the subject for decades.\n\nHalaven derives from halichondrin B, a substance identified in a black sponge that lives off the coast of Japan. Studies showed it has a powerful effect on tumors, blocking cell division in a way that scientists hadn\'t previously thought of.\n\nYoshito Kishi, a Harvard University chemistry professor, synthesized halichondrin B with funding from the National Cancer Institute. His work galvanized researchers at Eisai of Japan, who identified the active part of the molecule and, working with Dr. Kishi, went on to create the drug. Chemists say Halaven is among the most complex small-molecule drugs ever made commercially.\n\nDr. Kishi fears younger researchers are ignoring Halaven\'s lesson. Eisai Co., led by the founder\'s grandson since 1988, stuck with the Halaven research despite nearly dropping it more than once. ""If the CEO changes every 10 years, then this type of project couldn\'t go through,"" Dr. Kishi says.\n\nBig pharmaceutical companies used to have entire sections devoted to research on natural products, and they yielded some major anticancer drugs. Taxol, from the Pacific yew tree, is a staple chemotherapy drug; another set of widely used drugs derives from the Madagascar periwinkle plant. Yet despite popular notions about the miracle cures lying in the Amazon, many companies over the past decade have scaled back research into potential natural sources.\n\nRecently, rather than start with nature, many corporate scientists have been starting with a target, the particular process in cancerous cells that goes awry. They look for drugs, typically synthetic or semi-synthetic molecules cooked up by humans, that can block the target process.\n\nThis type of search holds out hope of a cure, rather than simply extending life. Halaven, meanwhile, is no cure. A study found it extended the life of patients with advanced breast cancer by about two-and-1/2 months, to 13 months.\n\nAt first it was hard to gather enough of the sponge molecule for research, let alone for studies on animals. The National Cancer Institute in the 1990s teamed up with the government of New Zealand to harvest a ton of sponges just to get a few hundred milligrams.\n\nCancer drugs from nature tend to have nasty side effects. Typically they work by blocking cell division, using a chemical ""weapon"" that one bacterium or fungus may use against another. When these drugs work, they also harm healthy cells. And in the most difficult tumors, they may lose effectiveness, as cancerous cells develop resistance.\n\nThat\'s why research into targeted drugs is center stage at large companies. ""Natural-products discovery is a small-company endeavor nowadays,"" says Ken Lloyd of Nereus Pharmaceuticals Inc., of San Diego, which is awaiting data from mid-stage trials of a lung-cancer drug derived from a marine fungus.\n\nThe fashion for targeted therapies also may have its blind spots. Some targeted therapies also offer only a few extra months of life. The best-known, Novartis AG \'s Gleevec, which went on the market in 2001, works by turning off the protein blamed for triggering chronic myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Gleevec has produced a nearly 90% five-year survival rate in patients, and 2010 sales were on track to top $4 billion.\n\nThe diabetes drug Byetta derives from a hormone of the Gila monster, a lizard of the southwest U.S. Getty Images\n\nBut Gleevec is virtually alone among targeted therapies in delivering such dramatic outcomes. Hopes that deciphering the human genome would lead directly to cures have failed to pan out; billions of dollars in corporate research has produced a string of failures. In breast cancer, for example, Pfizer Inc. \'s Sutent failed two big trials last March, showing serious side effects but no efficacy when added to chemotherapy.\n\nIn that light, Halaven\'s modest benefit looks meaningful. Eisai has said it hopes annual sales eventually top $1 billion. Much depends on whether Halaven proves valuable against earlier-stage disease, and on how well it works in combination therapies that are given the best odds of holding back cancer. Takashi Owa, head of Eisai\'s cancer unit, says Eisai wants to test it as a first-line therapy.\n\nAnd don\'t assume natural products are doomed to modest efficacy compared with targeted drugs, Dr. Owa says. ""Cytotoxic [cell-killing] agents in some cases can demonstrate unexpectedly remarkable clinical benefit,"" he says. A natural molecule, if screened properly, may prove to have the same qualities as a targeted drug—or even reveal previously unknown targets.\n\nOne popular drug target is ""mammalian target of rapamycin"" or mTOR. Rapamycin is a bacteria-derived antifungal drug that turned out to have anticancer properties. Scientists discovered the mTOR target, and now Merck & Co. and others are testing anticancer drugs believed to hit mTOR better than rapamycin does.\n\nCharles Sawyers, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who was involved in the Gleevec research, says, ""Natural products remain quite interesting and, often, represent the most exquisite examples of targeted therapies—selected for their activities through evolution.""\n\nWrite to Peter Landers at peter.landers@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">An interesting and generally well-written story about fascinating research.  However, for the main drug profiled, there weren’t enough details to satisfy several of our key criteria.  </span>", ,4,real

It may actually help you live longer, according to new research from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, found that women who were optimistic had a significantly lower risk of dying from several major diseases, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory disease, compared to other women whose outlook on life was less positive.\n\n“Optimism in prior research has been shown to be related to better health behaviors and better health outcomes, particularly in cardiovascular disease,” postdoctoral research fellow Kaitlin Hagan, co-lead author of the study, told CBS News. “So in our study we wanted to expand that and look at all-cause mortality and be able to see whether optimism improves other health behaviors that then affects mortality, or whether there’s an independent effect of optimism on mortality.”\n\nFor the study, the researchers analyzed data on from 2004 to 2012 on 70,000 women who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study, a long-running research project tracking women’s health via surveys every two years.\n\nTo measure levels of optimism, participants were asked to use a five-point scale to either agree or disagree with six statements, such as, “In uncertain times, I usually expect the best.”\n\nThe results showed that the most optimistic women – those in the top 25 percent – had a nearly 30 percent lower risk of dying from any of the diseases analyzed in the study when compared to the least optimistic participants in the lowest 25 percent.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers found that the most optimistic women had:\n\na 16 percent lower risk of dying from cancer.\n\na 38 percent lower risk of dying from heart disease.\n\na 39 percent lower risk of dying from stroke.\n\na 38 percent lower risk of dying from respiratory disease.\n\nThe researchers controlled for a number of factors that could have had an impact on lifespan, including marital status, education level, and other socioeconomic factors.\n\nWhile the study is observational and cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship between optimism and a longer life, the researchers have some theories for what might be behind the connection.\n\n“It’s a combination,” Hagan said. “If you’re more optimistic, you tend to have healthier behaviors. Optimistic people are likely to have better diets, they’re exercising more, and they’re getting better sleep.”\n\nHowever, even after the researchers accounted for these factors, the results still suggest that optimism itself is linked to a longer life.\n\n“So it could be that optimism directly impacts our biological functioning,” Hagan said. “Optimism is linked with lower inflammation and healthier biomarker levels and lipid levels, so there could be an independent effect on optimism.”\n\nShe said her team plans to focus more on the potential impact of optimism on biological functioning in future research.\n\nThe authors point out that since the study was only done in women, who were mainly white, the results might not be generalizable to other populations. However, they note, “there is no clear basis for believing that the effects of optimism on health differ by sex or race.”\n\nFinally, the researchers emphasize that while some people may think they’re just not optimistic, it is something that is modifiable. They suggested a number of steps people can take to improve their level of optimism.\n\n“One is called ‘best possible self,’” Eric Kim, who also co-led the study, told CBS News. “So you think about your different domains of life, whether it’s your personal relationship, your spouse, your career, your friendships, and in each of those domains you think about the best possible outcome.”\n\nHagan had some suggestions, too. “Simple things like thinking about what you’re grateful for every day or writing down what things make you happy or what things you’re looking forward to can help someone to increase their optimism, which can improve health outcomes as we’ve seen here,” she said.']","The story also missed an important discussion about how much the results could stem from having good health–that perhaps this causes the optimism, and not vice versa.","
A story by CBS news plays up a new study in the American Journal of Epidemiology that could give anyone reason to feel optimistic: Optimism itself is linked to a longer life, at least based on a survey of professional nurses over the years. The survey used by the researchers was the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), which reaches out to tens of thousands of medical nurses every 2 years and asks them basic questions. The data is often used to help guide public policy.
The story attempts to lay out the potential benefits of optimism and their relation to various diseases and longevity–but it did so using relative risk numbers, which are not reflective of the true impact. The story also missed an important discussion about how much the results could stem from having good health–that perhaps this causes the optimism, and not vice versa. Also, no independent sources–who could provide insight and some skepticism–were included.

All underwent surgery for their cancer before they began treatment with either Opdivo (nivolumab) or Yervoy (ipilimumab), the drug that\'s the current standard of care.\n\nBoth drugs are ""immunotherapies,"" which work by boosting the immune system\'s ability to spot and destroy tumor cells.\n\nAfter a year of treatment, 71 percent of patients in the Opdivo group were alive without any recurrence of the disease, compared with 61 percent of those treated with Yervoy. And at 18 months, the rate was 66 percent for Opdivo and 53 percent for Yervoy, the findings showed.\n\nAccording to the Skin Cancer Foundation, metastatic melanoma accounts for only about 1 percent of skin cancer cases but causes the majority of skin cancer deaths.\n\n""Our results demonstrate that [Opdivo] is more effective in treating patients with stage III and IV melanoma, cutting the risk of relapse by a third,"" lead researcher Dr. Jeffrey Weber, professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine, said in a university news release.\n\n""Results like this will change how we practice medicine.

Five percent of patients on Opdivo had to stop treatment due to side effects, compared with 31 percent of those on Yervoy. The most common side effects for both drugs were fatigue and diarrhea.\n\nWeber added that ""the safety of [Opdivo] is very promising.""\n\nThe study is scheduled for presentation Monday in Madrid, Spain, at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. It was also published online Sept. 10 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nBoth Opdivo and Yervoy are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced (metastatic) melanoma. In some patients, the drugs are used in combination.\n\nDr. Michele Green is a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She said any advance in the care of aggressive melanomas is welcome news for patients.\n\n""It is amazing that there is now an alternative that is superior to conventional chemotherapy for advanced metastatic disease,"" Green said after reviewing the new study findings. ""With these advanced melanomas -- that have high risks of recurrences and have poor outcomes -- it is vital to look at alternative treatments. The future in cancer treatments lies in immunotherapy and other targeted options.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on melanoma.']",The story would have been stronger if it had mentioned the steep costs of these drugs.,"The story focuses on a recent study that found the drug nivolumab (sold under the trade name Opdivo) is superior to the drug ipilimumab (sold as Yervoy) in preventing recurrence of Stage 3 and Stage 4 melanoma after surgery, at least when it comes to recurrence-free survival.

""While future studies are needed, we\'re optimistic of the role of miRNAs as biomarkers of disease and prognosis, and may demonstrate a potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer treatment.""\n\nResearchers conducted the randomized study with two groups of mice. One group was fed the equivalent of two servings (2 ounces) per day of walnuts for humans, while the second group received a similar control diet with no walnuts. After 25 days, researchers found that in walnut-fed mice, key miRNA that may affect cancer cell inflammation, vascularization (blood supply) and proliferation were positively engaged.\n\nThe tumors of mice fed the walnut-containing diet were found to have 10 times the amount of total omega-3 fatty acids, including plant-based alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), in the tissue compared to the mice fed the control diet. The study results found that a smaller tumor size was associated with greater percentage of omega-3s in tumor tissues, suggesting that ALA may provide a protective benefit. Tumor growth rate was also significantly slower in the walnut group compared to the control group. As this study was conducted on animals, results cannot yet be implied for humans.\n\nALA is an essential fatty acid critical to various body processes and is known to reduce inflammation. Walnuts are the only nut that contain a significant source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (2.5 grams per ounce). Walnuts also contain a variety of antioxidants, (3.7 mmol/ounce), and numerous vitamins and minerals.\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer worldwide and is second to only lung cancer as the leading cause of death in Western Countries.1 Diet has been shown to be a modifiable risk factor in preventing many types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. It is estimated that 30-50 percent of colorectal cancer in men and 20 percent in women can be prevented by diet and other lifestyle changes.2\n\nAn article detailing these findings, ""Dietary Walnut Suppression of Colorectal Cancer in mice: mediation by miRNA patterns and fatty acid incorporation"" has been published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry.3\n\n###\n\nThis study was supported from a grant by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the California Walnut Commission.\n\nAbout California Walnut Commission\n\nThe California Walnut Commission, established in 1987, is funded by mandatory assessments of the growers.

But the release benefits from several “Not Applicables” and borderline “Satisfactory” ratings that could have gone the other way.,"Mice are not people. Yet many medical research headlines about mouse studies extend the implicit promise that whatever is discovered may cure diseases in humans. This release tries to correct that by mentioning “animal study” in the sub-headline and in its first sentence. That’s more than many releases would do, but the main headline (not the subhead) is what appears in search results about this release, and we still worry most people will assume the wrong implicit promise.
The study discussed here is about the biochemistry surrounding certain genetic changes in mice fed walnuts while growing colon cancer tumors. It appears the mouse tumors grew more slowly in the mice fed the equivalent of a human diet of two ounces of walnuts per day. The study is trying to unpack the mechanism of that impact. And apart from the headline, it mostly does a satisfactory job of communicating the results of the study in a responsible, measured way.
But let’s remember that these findings in mice are many years away from any human application. And yet a public relations company connected to the California Walnut Commission is very eager to make sure you — probably not a cancer scientist, but definitely a human potential walnut consumer — are aware of what happened in these mice. Yes, the study carries tantalizing information about the way the walnut diet appears to influence the genetics of colon tumors — in the mice — but it will take much more investigation before it yields the kind of results that warrant a headline, “New Harvard research finds walnuts may help slow colon cancer growth.”

The randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in 121 patients showed that MM36 demonstrates a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoints versus vehicle as measured by improvement in IGA score (Investigators Global Assessment) and percentage change in EASI score (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The mean percentage improvement in baseline EASI score was notable very early at week 1 (31.4% vs. 6% for vehicle; p=.0005) and at week 2 (39.0% vs. 3% for vehicle; p=.0001). These effects were sustained through week 8 of the study. MM36 was also associated with improvement in patient-reported outcomes, most notably rapid and sustained itch relief, with Visual Analog Scale scores showing improvement from moderate to mild within the first week (36.4% mean change; p=.0011).\n\nMM36, a PDE4 inhibitor, reduces inflammation in affected skin by inhibiting production of cytokines and chemical mediators that are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation. MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of Anacor Pharmaceuticals\' crisaborole product.\n\n""The results of the Phase 2 study suggest that MM36 represents a potentially safe, effective and well-tolerated non-steroidal treatment for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis,"" said Linda Stein Gold, MD, director of clinical research, Department of Dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital and co-author of the article. ""Based on the results of this study, it appears that MM36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology.""\n\n""We are pleased that JAAD, the most respected peer-reviewed journal in dermatology, published the Phase 2 results,"" said Bradley Glassman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Medimetriks. ""We believe these Phase 2 results demonstrate compelling evidence of MM36\'s capacity to be a leading topical PDE4 inhibitor and are aggressively developing MM36 for atopic dermatitis in the US. Atopic Dermatitis patients have few treatment options and Medimetriks is dedicated to addressing this important unmet need.""\n\nThe JAAD article discussing the Phase 2 results can be found by visiting www.jaad.org.\n\nAbout Atopic Dermatitis\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by red, swollen and cracked skin with intense itching. The onset of AD occurs most commonly between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the condition in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age. The majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease during childhood, although 10% to 30% of patients maintain the condition throughout their lives. A small percentage of the population develops first symptoms as adults. It has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with AD in the U.S. and this disease accounts for up to 20% of patient visits to dermatology offices.\n\nCurrent treatments for atopic dermatitis include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Topical steroids are typically used as first line therapies and are effective anti-inflammatory agents. However, topical steroids may be associated with local and systemic side effects when used for extended periods of time, including skin atrophy, acne and telangiectasias locally, and HPA axis suppression systemically. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are recommended as second-line treatment for people with atopic dermatitis who are at risk of steroid-related side effects. TCIs carry boxed warnings about a possible association with skin malignancies and lymphoma, although studies have not demonstrated a clear link. Their use can be limited by local adverse reactions such as burning and stinging.\n\nAbout MM36\n\nMedimetriks has sole, exclusive US rights to MM36. Discovered by Otsuka, MM36 is an investigational non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis. MM36 is hypothesized to exert anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemical mediators thought to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, which is an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation.\n\nAbout Otsuka\n\nOtsuka Pharmaceutical is a global healthcare company with the corporate philosophy: ""Otsuka – people creating new products for better health worldwide."" Otsuka researches, develops, manufactures and markets innovative and original products, with a focus on pharmaceutical products for the treatment of diseases and nutraceutical products for the maintenance of everyday health.\n\nIn pharmaceuticals, Otsuka is a leader in the challenging area of mental health and also has research programs on several under-addressed diseases including tuberculosis, a significant global public health issue.

The MM36 compound is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ointment believed to stop itching and redness by blocking chemicals released by an enzyme known as PDE4 subtype B and active in causing inflammation. The release describes the percentage of improvement in symptoms over a period of eight weeks, but doesn’t describe or quantify what improvement means.

""Dementia is not an inevitable cause of aging. How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline.""\n\nIf the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age.\n\nAnd the scans would be ""well set up for routine testing,"" according to Chiesa. ""It\'s very easy to do, and it\'s very quick to do.""\n\nWhen healthy, arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ, ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain.\n\nBut damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain, which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time, the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study.\n\n""What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia,"" said Carol Routledge, Director of Research at Alzheimer\'s Research UK, who was not involved in the research.\n\nVascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer\'s disease, studies have found. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia.\n\nDementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function. Alzheimer\'s disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases.\n\nAround 50 million people suffer from dementia worldwide, according to the World Health Organization , with numbers projected to rise to 152 million by 2050.\n\nIn the United States, the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the UK it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\n\'Promising findings\'\n\nThe study\'s findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations.\n\n""Getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people, so it\'s promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development,"" said Paul Edwards, Director of Clinical Services at Dementia UK.\n\nBut he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis, saying: ""The elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia.""\n\nThere is currently no cure for dementia, though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms.\n\n""Often, a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information, no follow-up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next.""\n\nPrevious studies this year have linked dementia risk to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and fitness level , but its effects remain largely incurable.\n\nMore research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia.\n\n""While these findings are interesting, as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be,"" said Routledge.\n\nRoutledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking, only consuming alcohol within recommended limits, staying active, monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain.']",The story didn’t tell readers this was an observational study–cause-and-effect couldn’t be established.,"The story focuses on research presented a conference that found increased intensity of “forward compression waves” (FCWs) in the carotid artery was associated with an increased risk of dementia later in life.

Even with this trio of medicines, Mr. Brown’s LDL cholesterol level hovered around 200.\n\nThe two PCSK9 inhibitors approved by the FDA last year were developed as a result of research done by UT Southwestern geneticists Dr. Helen Hobbs and Dr. Jonathan Cohen. Using data from the Dallas Heart Study, a population-based study that gathered extensive medical data on 6,000 Dallas residents, the two researchers showed that certain mutations to the gene that codes for the protein PCSK9 lead to low levels of cholesterol in the blood.\n\nFurther,Dr. Hobbs and Dr. Cohen found a woman who had inherited not one, but two of these mutations in the PCSK9 gene – one mutation from each parent. This woman had stunningly low levels of LDL cholesterol. While anything below 100 is considered good, her LDL cholesterol level was just 14. Crucially, this woman was in good health, suggesting that therapies aimed at blocking PCSK9 would not only be effective, but also safe.\n\nTheir research led to the development by drug companies of evolocumab and alirocumab, the two approved PCSK9 inhibitors, which are delivered by monthly or semimonthly injections.\n\nDr. Hobbs, Director of the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development, holds the Eugene McDermott Distinguished Chair for the Study of Human Growth and Development, the Philip O’Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Chair in Developmental Biology, and the 1995 Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Cardiology Research. Dr. Cohen, Professor of Internal Medicine and with the McDermott Center, holds the C. Vincent Prothro Distinguished Chair in Human Nutrition Research. Mr. Brown had been part of a clinical trial testing the safety and effectiveness of one of the new PCSK9 inhibitors and, when the drugs were approved, Dr. Khera began working to get Mr. Brown approved by his insurance to be on the new regimen.\n\n“In the world of cholesterol patients, most are well-controlled with statins, and they should stay on those,” said Dr. Khera. “But Mr. Brown is the perfect patient for PCSK9 inhibitors. We knew he could tolerate it because he’d been in a clinical trial, he knew how to administer the injections, and he was very high-risk. We’d exhausted the other options in trying to control his cholesterol.”\n\nTwo months after he started his biweekly injections of the new drug, Mr. Brown’s LDL cholesterol level was down to 111 – not quite normal, which is 100 or less – but an almost 50 percent reduction from the level it had been for years.\n\nIt’s a good sign for Mr. Brown, who looks forward to many more years of running his business, watching Dallas Cowboys games, and spending time with his grandchildren.\n\n“There are many more Frank Browns out there – patients who can’t control their cholesterol with the standard drugs,” said Dr. Khera. “It’s wonderful to have this option to offer this special set of patients.” About UT Southwestern Medical CenterUT Southwestern, one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation, integrates pioneering biomedical research with exceptional clinical care and education.

1255,story_reviews_01178,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3696/,2011-03-03 05:00:00,Virtual Colonoscopy Gains in Popularity. Is It Right for You?,"['A study finds that use of virtual colonoscopy, a non-invasive way of scanning the colon for potentially cancerous growths, is on the rise.\n\nThat’s a bit of a surprise, given that not all medical experts agree on whether the virtual screen is as reliable as a traditional colonoscopy, in which doctors insert a scope with a small camera into the colon. Plus, Medicare does not currently reimburse patients for routine screening with virtual colonoscopy, but does cover evaluations with colonoscopy. Add to that the aggressive public awareness campaign for colonoscopy screening led by celebrities like Katie Couric, who allowed TV cameras in as she got her first test, and it’s clear why more people are familiar with the scope than with its virtual cousin.\n\nBut in spite of those challenges, Megan McHugh at the Health Research and Educational Trust in Chicago and her team report that about 17% of hospitals in the U.S. now offer the screening test, up from 13% in 2005.\n\nAs its name implies, virtual colonoscopy is way to survey the colon without actually using a scope. Patients lie in a CT scanner, which takes a series of pictures from a variety of different angles, and a computer compiles the snapshots in two different ways. The images can be viewed as two dimensional CT scans, which display any possible abnormalities protruding from the lining of the colon. Or, the images can be combined to generate a 3D view of the colon, allowing the doctors to “fly through” the organ looking for any suspicious growths or protrusions.\n\nThe prep for both the virtual and actual colonoscopy is the same — the dreaded “colon cleanse” that many patients find is the worst part of the procedure. The night before the test, they start drinking clear liquids and take agents to loosen their stools and empty their colon so any remaining debris isn’t mistaken for a tumor during the screen.\n\nWhile the virtual colonoscopy does not require the sedation and insertion of a scope that colonoscopy does, it involves exposure to a small amount of radiation. But according to Dr. Marc Gollub, director of CT and gastrointestinal radiology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, “the radiation is much lower than a regular CT scan and has not been proven to be of any risk. It’s similar to [the exposure from cosmic radiation] you might get on a long airplane flight.”\n\nWhile a growing body of data suggest that virtual colonoscopy is as sensitive as colonoscopy in picking up potential tumors, not all cancer experts agree that it’s a good alternative to the gold-standard scope. While the American Cancer Society, the American College of Physicians and other gastroenterology experts recommend virtual screening every five years, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a congressionally mandated but non-federal, independent group of medical experts, concluded the evidence wasn’t strong enough to justify Medicare coverage of the service.\n\nSo which one is right for you? Virtual colonoscopy is a good option for those who can’t be sedated for colonoscopy, or who simply can’t tolerate the scope. In McHugh’s survey, hospitals reported that these patients make up the bulk of their use. And given the relatively low cost of investing in the software and other equipment required to run a virtual scan, more hospitals may be adding the option to their patient services. The virtual scan does involve radiation exposure, and if doctors find an abnormality that needs to be removed, you’ll have to undergo a colonoscopy anyway (to avoid another colon cleanse, consider scheduling a colonoscopy on the same day in case tumors need to be removed). But Gollub notes that only about 8% of healthy adults getting regularly screened actually have tumors.\n\nGiven the fact that more hospitals are offering virtual colonoscopy, it’s worth discussing with your doctor. In the end, it’s a matter of personal preference — it’s less important how you get screened, just that you do get screened.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This column offers a far too-limited view of colon cancer screening options, focusing only on what form of colonoscopy someone might choose.</span>","The story attempts to provide information about a recently published survey of hospitals noting that 17% now offer CT colonoscopy, up from 14% 3 years prior. Why is that important? Is that number high or low? The headline suggests that the method is gaining, but up 3% is hardly an overwhelming response.
We also think the story missed an opportunity since it could have provided readers with more information about who is potentially best served by the virtual test. Elderly, frail patients who cannot undergo both the bowel prep and sedation are prime candidates. If you are going to ask readers a question – “Is It Right For You?” –  you should give them enough information to come up with an educated answer.

Midwives are experts in the care of women having healthy pregnancies, and tend to spend more time with their patients with a focus on the overall physical, emotional and psychological wellbeing of mothers and their newborns.\n\n""Our findings show that women who are more vulnerable benefit from the care of a midwife, likely because they receive more time, counselling and education on how to care for themselves,"" said the study\'s lead author Daphne McRae, a post-doctoral research fellow at the UBC school of population and public health who conducted the study while she was a PhD student at the University of Saskatchewan.\n\nFor the study, the researchers followed 57,872 women in B.C. who carried a single baby, had low-to-moderate risk pregnancies, and received medical insurance premium assistance sometime between 2005 and 2012. They used maternity, medical billing and demographic data to investigate the odds of small-for-gestational age birth, pre-term birth and low birth weight for low-income women receiving care from a midwife, GP, or OB.\n\nAfter controlling for differences such as age, previous pregnancies, where they lived and pre-existing medical conditions, the researchers found that low-income women who were receiving prenatal care from a midwife had 29 per cent lower odds of a small-for-gestational age birth compared to women who received care from a GP. Compared to those who received care from an OB, low-income women receiving midwifery care had a 41 per cent reduction in odds for small-for-gestational age birth, the researchers found.\n\nMcRae said the findings add new evidence in support of midwifery care, and support the development of policies to ensure midwives are available and accessible, especially for low-income women. Midwifery is not available in all parts of the country.\n\n""Waitlists for midwives can be quite long, so women who are educated and health-conscious typically access midwives early on in their pregnancies,"" said McRae. ""But more vulnerable women might not be as aware of the services available to them, so expanding midwifery to make it available for all women is important.""\n\n""Our research could help develop policies that make the service more accessible to low-income women,"" added senior author Nazeem Muhajarine, a professor in community health and epidemiology at the University of Saskatchewan and McRae\'s supervisor while she conducted the research.\n\n###\n\nThe study was co-authored by Patricia Janssen, Saraswathi Vedam, Maureen Mayhew at the University of British Columbia, and Deborah Mpofu and Ulrich Teucher at the University of Saskatchewan.']",But the study could pave the way for further studies that establish midwifery’s benefits and risks.,"This news release touted an observational study that found low-income women in British Columbia who used midwives for prenatal care experienced fewer complications than those who used general practitioners or obstetricians. The study was published in the British Medical Journal Open.
Commendably, the release used mostly cautious language, stating the study adds “new evidence in support of midwives as a safe option.” However, it did not quantify adequately the differences in the outcomes or explain the limitations of observational data.

The test, developed by biochemists, engineers and chemists at McMaster University, features an all-inclusive patch of reactive material, or reagent, printed on paper that changes colour to indicate the presence of a biological marker for a specific bacterium, virus, or even cancer. “It’s a very simple device that anyone can use,” says Yingfu Li, a professor of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster and one of the authors of a new paper in the German chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie. “There’s a huge need for this type of technology.” Li explains that the platform can be manufactured cheaply, and easily formulated to detect biological markers for a huge range of illnesses. Only a tiny sample of blood, sweat or other fluid is required, since the test works by detecting and amplifying the target DNA or RNA sequence in a sample. A single molecule of the target can be multiplied thousands of times, producing a visible result. Conceivably, a user could swab a doorknob or dip it in a toilet bowl to test for Ebola, for example. The test is the latest in a series of related developments to emerge from the Biointerfaces Institute, whose mission is to create useful new substances that combine biological agents and physical materials. “The new test involves printing of all required components needed to amplify a DNA or RNA target directly on paper,” says the institute’s director, John Brennan. “The user only needs to add the sample to the paper and wait a few minutes for a color to develop.” The test material is suspended in pullulan, a naturally derived polymeric sugar that is also the platform for the familiar Listerine breath strips. Pullulan allows the testing materials to remain viable for months until used. The new test, which could be commercialized quickly, the researchers say, can diagnose infections even before patients feel symptoms. During cold season, for example, patients could save trips to the doctor and exposing the public by testing themselves at home. The test can also quickly differentiate between illnesses that share similar symptoms, such as headache, fever or diarrhea, permitting a quick diagnosis and earlier treatment. Because it is portable, inexpensive and requires no other equipment, the technology – which can be printed on paper by an inkjet printer – could be used in many environments, such as homes and airports, and in remote locations. Research funding was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Ontario Centres of Excellence and Pro-Lab Diagnostics Inc.\n\nSEE ORIGINAL STUDY']",Will a paper diagnostic test under development change the diagnostic tools landscape? By not mentioning alternatives (both new and conventional) this release fails to make its case.,"Paper diagnostic test strip. Image: McMaster University
This news release reports on the development of paper test strips that amplify DNA or RNA from blood, sweat or urine and determine if the person taking the test has a disease. The strips are made of a polymeric sugar film integrated with the paper device. Once a sample is applied the paper changes color to indicate the presence of a marker for a “specific bacterium, virus, or even cancer,” according to the release. The researchers quoted in the release claim that these test strips can be easily and inexpensively manufactured and, because they are portable, could be used to diagnose or self-diagnose illness (such as Ebola) in remote areas before the subject even knows they are ill. But the release does not make clear how such a test could be used to diagnose and differentiate between the multitudes of different diseases and conditions that afflict humans. Besides skirting other important details such as ballpark cost of the strips and data backing up claimed benefits, the release doesn’t put the paper test in context. While the idea of a “simple” paper test to check for illness may sound novel to the public, paper diagnostic tools have been under development since at least 2007.

The findings, presented at the 68th AACC Annual Scientific Meeting & Clinical Lab Expo in Philadelphia, showed that the biochip test, which allows multiple tests to be run on one blood sample, was as accurate as existing molecular tests that analyze DNA.\n\n""This is the first time that we have used this biochip technology to test for an increased risk of Alzheimer\'s disease,"" said Emma C. Harte, PhD, a research scientist at Randox Laboratories. ""This type of testing is important in our quest to understand and diagnose Alzheimer\'s and empower patients to understand risks, consider medication, and even make early lifestyle changes.""\n\nThis test detects the presence of a protein in the blood produced by a specific variation of the apolipoprotein gene (ApoE4), which is associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer\'s disease. The apolipoprotein gene is inherited from each parent and when a patient inherits the ApoE4 variant from one parent they have a three times greater risk of developing Alzheimer\'s disease, whereas a patient who inherits ApoE4 from both parents is eight-to-12 times more likely to develop the disease.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the biochip test, 384 samples were analyzed and results compared to those from a standard molecular diagnostic test. Researchers from Randox Laboratories collaborated with research colleagues at the Medical University of Vienna and found that results from the two tests were in 100% agreement. As biochip tests allow clinicians and researchers to quickly run multiple tests on one sample of blood, this new test is also faster and more affordable than the standard DNA test, producing results in only three hours. This enables doctors to predict the risk of an individual developing Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\n""Pairing this test with medical and family history for risk of Alzheimer\'s disease has the real potential to advance personalized medicine,"" said Harte. ""This fast, accurate testing will allow doctors and patients to make more informed choices earlier to potentially slow the possible progress of Alzheimer\'s.""\n\nIn addition to this study, researchers will present the latest in Alzheimer\'s disease at the AACC Annual Scientific Meeting & Clinical Lab Expo, including:\n\nSession Information\n\nRegistration for the AACC Annual Scientific Meeting is free for members of the media.

Overall, the release ably reports on the findings of the study, which was set up to verify the precision of the biochip test. And it does a creditable job of explaining the role of the gene variant ApoE4 in assessing risk of AD and making the distinction between elevated risk, and disease causation.
It could have been clearer and stronger if it had offered a bit more context for the usefulness of such testing, given  there currently is no way to prevent or reverse AD. And it provides no information on the potential costs of the assay or a timetable for its availability. One other concern relates to the lead paragraph which states that the test helps identify “which patients” are at elevated risk of AD, when in fact the blood samples taken from study participants may have included people who were not yet “patients” and — based on their ApoE4 status, at least — are likely never to be.
But the bigger question might be: What is the value of the test to patients or would-be patients? APOE testing has been around for about 20 years and the consensus is that it is a research tool, not a clinical tool.

That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say.\n\nMultivitamins also may have different results in women, younger men or people less healthy than those in this study.\n\n""It\'s a very mild effect and personally I\'m not sure it\'s significant enough to recommend to anyone"" although it is promising, said Dr. Ernest Hawk, vice president of cancer prevention at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and formerly of the National Cancer Institute.\n\n""At least this doesn\'t suggest a harm"" as some previous studies on single vitamins have, he said.\n\nHawk reviewed the study for the American Association for Cancer Research, which is meeting in Anaheim, Calif., where the study was to be presented on Wednesday. It also was published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nAbout one-third of U.S. adults and as many as half of those over 50 take them. They are marketed as a kind of insurance policy against bad eating. Yet no government agency recommends their routine use ""regardless of the quality of a person\'s diet,"" says a fact sheet from the federal Office of Dietary Supplements.\n\nSome fads, such as the antioxidant craze over vitamins A and E and beta-carotene, backfired when studies found more health risk with those supplements, not less. Many of those were single vitamins in larger doses than the ""100% of daily value"" amounts that multivitamins typically contain.\n\nScience on vitamins has been skimpy. Most studies have been observational — they look at groups of people who do and do not use vitamins, a method that can\'t give firm conclusions.\n\nDr. J. Michael Gaziano, of Brigham and Women\'s Hospital and VA Boston, led a stronger test. Nearly 15,000 male doctors who were 50 or older and free of cancer when the study started were given monthly packets of Centrum Silver or fake multivitamins without knowing which type they received.\n\nAfter about 11 years, there were 2,669 new cancers, and some people had cancer more than once. For every 1,000 men per year in the study, there were 17 cancers among multivitamin users and more than 18 among those taking the placebo pills. That worked out to an 8% lower risk of developing cancer in the vitamin group.\n\nMultivitamins made no difference in the risk of developing prostate cancer, which accounted for half of all cases. They lowered the risk of other cancers collectively by about 12%. There also was a trend toward fewer cancer deaths among multivitamin users, but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone.\n\nSide effects were fairly similar except for more rashes among vitamin users. The National Institutes of Health paid for most of the study. Pfizer Inc. supplied the pills and other companies supplied the packaging.\n\nThe main reason to take a multivitamin is to correct or prevent a deficiency, ""but there may be a modest benefit in reducing the risk of cancer in older men,"" Gaziano said.\n\nCancer experts said the results need to be confirmed by another study before recommending multivitamins to the public. These participants were healthier — only 4% smoked, for example.\n\nFor people who do want to take multivitamins, doctors suggest:\n\n— Be aware that they are dietary supplements, which do not get the strict testing required of prescription medicines.\n\n— Ask your doctor before taking any. Vitamin K can interfere with common heart medicines and blood thinners, and vitamins C and E can lower the effectiveness of some types of chemotherapy. For people having surgery, some vitamins affect bleeding and response to anesthesia.\n\n— Current and former smokers should avoid multivitamins with lots of beta-carotene or vitamin A; two studies have tied them to increased risk of lung cancer.']","Details matter, and this AP story provided more of them than the ","In lots of little ways, this AP piece exemplifies the difference between very good and outstanding health reporting.

The researchers, led by Dale Boger, co-chair of TSRI’s Department of Chemistry, discovered a way to structurally modify vancomycin to make an already-powerful version of the antibiotic even more potent.\n\n“Doctors could use this modified form of vancomycin without fear of resistance emerging,” said Boger, whose team announced the finding today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe original form of vancomycin is an ideal starting place for developing better antibiotics. The antibiotic has been prescribed by doctors for 60 years, and bacteria are only now developing resistance to it. This suggests bacteria already have a hard time overcoming vancomycin’s original “mechanism of action,” which works by disrupting how bacteria form cell walls.\n\nBoger called vancomycin “magical” for its proven strength against infections, and previous studies by Boger and his colleagues at TSRI had shown that it is possible to add two modifications to vancomycin to make it even more potent. “With these modifications, you need less of the drug to have the same effect,” Boger said.\n\nThe new study shows that scientists can make a third modification—which interferes with a bacterium’s cell wall in a new way—with promising results. Combined with the previous modifications, this alteration gives vancomycin a 1,000-fold increase in activity, meaning doctors would need to use less of the antibiotic to fight infection.\n\nThe discovery makes this version of vancomycin the first antibiotic to have three independent mechanisms of action. “This increases the durability of this antibiotic,” said Boger. “Organisms just can’t simultaneously work to find a way around three independent mechanisms of action. Even if they found a solution to one of those, the organisms would still be killed by the other two.”\n\nTested against Enterococci bacteria, the new version of vancomycin killed both vancomycin-resistant Enterococci and the original forms of Enterococci.\n\nThe next step in this research is to design a way to synthesize the modified vancomycin using fewer steps in the lab, as the current method takes 30 steps. But Boger calls this the “easy part” of the project, compared with the challenge of designing the molecule in the first place.\n\nEven if the process isn’t streamlined, Boger believes the new vancomycin’s lifesaving powers make its production valuable. “Antibiotics are total cures for bacterial infections,” said Boger. “Making this molecule is important, even by the current approach, if the failure of antibiotics continues.”\n\nIn addition to Boger, authors of the study, “Peripheral modifications of [Ψ[CH2NH]Tpg4]vancomycin with added synergistic mechanisms of action provide durable and potent antibiotics,” included first author Akinori Okano and Nicholas A. Isley, both of TSRI.\n\nThe study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants F32 GM114948 and CA041101).\n\nAbout The Scripps Research Institute\n\nThe Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) is one of the world's largest independent, not-for-profit organizations focusing on research in the biomedical sciences. TSRI is internationally recognized for its contributions to science and health, including its role in laying the foundation for new treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, and other diseases. An institution that evolved from the Scripps Metabolic Clinic founded by philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps in 1924, the institute now employs more than 2,500 people on its campuses in La Jolla, CA, and Jupiter, FL, where its renowned scientists—including two Nobel laureates and 20 members of the National Academies of Science, Engineering or Medicine—work toward their next discoveries. The institute's graduate program, which awards PhD degrees in biology and chemistry, ranks among the top ten of its kind in the nation. In October 2016, TSRI announced a strategic affiliation with the California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), representing a renewed commitment to the discovery and development of new medicines to address unmet medical needs. For more information, see www.scripps.edu.""]","The advance discussed in this news release is interesting and newsworthy, but it is several steps removed from clinical relevance — and that is far from clear in the news release.","The news release reports on the development of a new “mechanism of action” in the antibiotic vancomycin. However, while the release tells readers that vancomycin now has “new superpowers,” which “could eliminate the threat of antibiotic-resistant infections for years to come,” the new form of vancomycin has yet to be tested in an animal model — much less gone through the clinical trials in humans that would be necessary to determine how viable the new form may be in treating patients on any kind of widespread basis.
The release also says that “bacteria are only now developing resistance” to vancomycin — which is misleading. Vancomycin-resistant bacteria were first reported in 1987, 30 years ago — and papers (like this one) on how to limit the spread of vancomycin resistance date back more than 20 years.

The review articles are authored by an international panel of academic scientists, translational researchers and clinicians.\n\n""IBS considerably affects quality of life and places an enormous burden on patients, physicians and the health-care system,"" said Brooks D. Cash, M.D., A.G.A.F., F.A.C.G., F.A.C.P., F.A.S.G.E., Professor of Medicine in the Gastroenterology Division at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Ala. ""The results of these studies add to the growing body of medical evidence supporting the utility of IBgard®, a novel formulation of peppermint oil, in improving the symptoms, patient satisfaction and quality of life of patients with IBS. The understanding of IBS has expanded considerably over the past decade with many new studies, in part driven by the development of new therapeutic agents.""\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Cash was the lead study author of the IBSREST™ study, which demonstrated that IBgard® provided a statistically significant reduction in the Total IBS Symptom Score (TISS) in as early as 24 hours and at four weeks.\n\nGrowing Medical Support for Peppermint Oil in the Management of IBS\n\nThe World Gastroenterology Organization (WGO) issued global IBS guidelines in September 2015, which recommended peppermint oil in managing IBS as a first-line therapy option. The consensus report, entitled ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Global Perspective,""2 guides health providers in the best management of IBS through recommendations based on the latest evidence and resulting from a global expert consensus process based on best current practice. An international scientific and medical review team reported that there are a range of agents available to treat IBS and physicians should be knowledgeable about the efficacy and risk profile of any option they are about to prescribe. The review team concluded that as a first-line therapy option, peppermint oil is superior to placebo in improving IBS symptoms and the risk of adverse events is no greater with peppermint oil than with a placebo.\n\nThese evidence-based guidelines go through a rigorous process of authoring, editing and peer review. They are available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin and Russian. WGO, formed in 1935 and incorporated in 1958, is a federation of 110 member societies and 4 regional associations of gastroenterology representing more than 50,000 individual members worldwide focusing on the improvement of standards in gastroenterology training and education on a global scale.\n\nAdditionally, the support from the medical community builds on a previously important review article about the use of peppermint oil in IBS. In a meta-analysis by Dr. Enck, entitled ""Therapy Options in Irritable Bowel Syndrome,""3 published in The European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Dr. Enck and the authors concluded that the highest efficacy in the management of IBS is currently found in peppermint oil. Among the thirteen IBS options that Dr. Enck and the authors reviewed, only peppermint oil had the lowest NNT (number needed to treat) of 2-3 patients needed for one patient to benefit from the therapy.\n\nAbout Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nOne in six Americans experience Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a frustrating, under-diagnosed and under-treated condition characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, often associated with alteration in stool frequency and/or form. Bloating is also a common symptom experienced by patients with IBS. Recent understandings of the root causes of IBS point to gut mucosal barrier dysfunction and malabsorption.\n\nAbout IBgard\n\nIBgard® is a medical food specially formulated for the dietary management of IBS. IBgard® capsules contain solid state microspheres of peppermint oil, including its principal component l-Menthol, in a unique delivery system. With its patented Site Specific Targeting (SST®) technology, pioneered by IM HealthScience®, IBgard® capsules release Ultramen®, an ultra-purified peppermint oil, quickly and reliably to the small intestine, where its actions help manage IBS. Peppermint oil can help toward normalizing the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients, which have been compromised by IBS. Peppermint oil has also been shown to normalize intestinal transit time.\n\nIBgard® was studied in a pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-center trial called the I rritable B owel S yndrome R eduction E valuation and S afety T rial (IBSREST™). The study findings were accepted by a leading, peer-reviewed scientific journal, called Digestive Diseases and Sciences, and published in February 2016. The data showed that IBgard® demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the Total IBS Symptom Score (TISS) in as early as 24 hours and at four weeks. The TISS represents a composite score of eight individual IBS symptoms. Currently, there are limited options for patients with IBS that offer effective and rapid relief, especially during a flare-up.\n\nOver 10,000 healthcare practitioners, including 3,000 gastroenterologists, are estimated to have already used IBgard® for their patients. In a recent nationwide survey of gastroenterologists, IBgard® was the number one recommended peppermint oil for IBS. Like all medical foods, IBgard® does not require a prescription, but it must be used under medical supervision. Only doctors can diagnose IBS. The usual adult dose of IBgard® is 1-2 capsules as needed, up to three times a day, not to exceed 8 capsules per day.\n\nIBgard® is available to patients in the digestive aisle at most CVS/pharmacy, Walgreens and Rite Aid stores nationwide and now increasingly in independent drug stores and grocery stores across the country.\n\nAbout IM HealthScience®\n\nIM HealthScience® (IMH) is the innovator of IBgard® for the dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome. It is a privately held company based in Boca Raton, Florida, that is also the innovator of FDgard® for the dietary management of functional dyspepsia. It was founded in 2010 by a team of highly experienced pharmaceutical research and development and management executives. The company is dedicated to developing products to address gastrointestinal issues where there is a high unmet need.

If we can control the autoimmunity, we may reverse the diabetes. We showed that the islets [cells] can start to work again,"" said Dr. Yong Zhao, an assistant professor in the section of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nThis treatment could potentially be useful in other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n""It\'s quite remarkable that this approach, based on the re-education of immune cells, might work so well. The concept is very intriguing, and the treatment seems to be so simple and so safe,"" said Dr. Luca Inverardi, deputy director of translational research at the Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nBut he\'s also ""reasonably cautious,"" he said. ""The follow-up is long, up to 40 weeks, but it\'s not long enough to declare victory against diabetes yet,"" said Inverardi.\n\nAlso, he noted that the study involved only 15 Chinese people, and that type 1 diabetes is a bit different in that population. He said he\'d like to see larger studies with a more diverse population, followed for a longer time.\n\nResults of the study were published online Jan. 9 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nType 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, occurs when the body\'s immune system cells mistakenly attack the insulin-producing (beta) cells in the pancreas. Because their beta cells don\'t produce enough or any insulin, people with type 1 diabetes have to replace the lost insulin through injections to survive.\n\nStopping that autoimmune attack appears to be crucial to any treatment that hopes to cure or reverse type 1 diabetes.\n\nZhao\'s team developed a completely new approach. They take blood from a patient and separate out the immune system cells (lymphocytes). They briefly expose those cells to stem cells from umbilical cord blood from an unrelated infant and return the lymphocytes alone to the patient\'s body. The researchers have dubbed this ""Stem Cell Educator Therapy,"" because while exposed to the stem cells, the lymphocytes seem to relearn how they should behave.\n\nThe study participants, who were 15 to 41 years old, had had type 1 diabetes for an average of nine years. Six had some residual beta cell function and six did not. Both groups were given stem cell educator therapy. The other three people served as the control group.\n\nThe researchers measured C-peptide, a protein fragment that\'s a byproduct of insulin production, and found that the educator therapy group had improved levels of C-peptide at 12 weeks. These levels continued to improve until 24 weeks, and remained stable through the follow-up at 40 weeks. There were no changes in C-peptide in the control group.\n\nThe average daily dose of insulin dropped almost 39 percent after 12 weeks for the group with some beta cell function and 25 percent in those with no beta cell function, suggesting that the group with no beta cell function now produced insulin.\n\n""That means if you stop the autoimmune reaction, you may see beta cell regeneration, or there might be other precursor cells in the pancreas. If these data are confirmed, this is a very provocative and remarkable finding,"" Inverardi said.\n\nThe average hemoglobin A1C level dropped 1.06 percent for those with residual beta cell function and 1.68 percent for those without beta cell function. A1C levels measure average blood sugar levels over two to three months, and people with type 1 diabetes are advised to maintain A1C levels below 7 percent. A drop of 1 percent in A1C levels can reduce the risk of complications.\n\nThis was an initial clinical trial designed to test for safety. Zhao said that in future trials he hopes that with additional treatments people might get off insulin altogether.\n\nBut, even if that\'s not possible, the recovery of some beta cell function would be welcome news. ""In the absence of complete remission, there are very sizable advantages to having some beta cell function,"" Inverardi noted.\n\nBoth experts said the treatment appears safe, with no risk of rejection. No significant side effects were reported during the trial, other than some arm soreness where blood was taken and returned.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about type 1 diabetes from the Nemours Foundation\'s KidsHealth Web site.']","This story includes some elements of a good medical research news report, but several stumbles produced unsatisfactory grades on several of our criteria.","This story highlights the novelty of an experimental diabetes treatment. Yet despite cautionary statements from an independent source, the story portrays a preliminary safety test as being much more than it is. The story also should have told readers that this approach to overcoming insulin resistance may not be relevant to the overwhelming majority of people with diabetes, who do not use insulin.
It’s also a bit misleading for the story to call this a “clinical trial” since there were only 3 controls and 15 patients.

At a cost of several dollars per day, depending on dosage, it is much more expensive than older pain relievers such as ibuprofen.\n\nDuring the study, Dr. Nadir Arber of Tel Aviv University and his colleagues reviewed data collected from 1,561 people with a history of colorectal cancer. More than half had received Celebrex for approximately 3 years, before concerns over the increased risk of cardiovascular problems caused researchers to discontinue the study.\n\nThe scientists then followed the people willing to continue the research for another 2 years, noting who developed new polyps, including advanced polyps with features that suggest they’re more likely to become cancerous. Approximately half of the people who started the study agreed to continue.\n\nNot surprisingly, Celebrex users were more likely to develop cardiovascular problems, including a 66 percent higher risk of serious cardiac disorders. But over the total 5-year period, people who took Celebrex were also less likely to develop new and advanced polyps than people who took a placebo.\n\nSpecifically, new polyps were found in 58 percent of people on placebo, and only 51 percent on Celebrex.\n\nHowever, during the 5th year of the study alone, after the trial had been over for 2 years, 27 percent of Celebrex users developed new polyps, versus only 16 percent of people who had been on placebo - translating to a 66 percent higher risk among those who previously took Celebrex. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.\n\nThis rebound in risk actually makes biological sense, Chan told Reuters Health. If COX-2 inhibitors protect against colon cancer by blocking an enzyme pathway, when that blockage is released, the disease could occur “potentially at higher levels than had you never been on the drug in the first place,” he said.\n\nStill, the results are “very promising,” Arber told Reuters Health by e-mail, adding he is now working to identify people who could benefit from the drug without experiencing the side effects.\n\nOnly half of the people who originally agreed to participate in the study remained after 5 years, and it’s unclear how this might affect the results, noted Chan, whose own research suggests aspirin could prevent deaths from colorectal cancer.\n\nHowever, for a study that lasts this long, “those are acceptable numbers,” noted Arber.\n\nIf patients asked him whether they should take celecoxib to prevent colorectal cancer, Arber would tell them “no,” he added. “They should speak with their doctor.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/mDNurd The American Journal of Gastroenterology, online April 19, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">We applaud the generally restrained take on the results, with “caveats” right in the headline and some discussion of the study’s limitations.

Nevertheless, it raises hope that a simple, noninvasive intervention might go a long way towards countering the fatigue, poorer prognosis and impaired quality of life that can result from chemo-induced muscle mass loss.\n\n""Fish oil may prevent loss of weight and muscle by interfering with some of the pathways that are altered in advanced cancer,"" study author Dr. Vera Mazurak, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said in a news release. ""This holds great promise, because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer-related malnutrition.""\n\nMazurak and her colleagues report their observations in the Feb. 28 online edition of Cancer.\n\nTo explore the therapeutic potential of fish oil supplements, the authors offered 16 cancer patients undergoing an initial 10-week chemotherapy regimen a daily dose of 2.2 grams of a particular omega-3 fatty acid called eicosapentaenoic (EPA).\n\nWhile these patients took fish oil supplements throughout their chemotherapy treatment, a second group of 24 patients underwent the same regimen minus the fish oil.\n\nThe results: continual muscle and fat measurements revealed that the group that took no fish oil supplementation lost an average of just over 5 pounds; the supplement group lost no weight.\n\nWhat\'s more, blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream EPA concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains.\n\nSpecifically, nearly 70 percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre-chemo muscle mass or gained muscle. By comparison, less than 30 percent in the non-supplement group kept their original muscle mass.\n\nTotal fat tissue measurements were unaffected by fish oil supplementation, the team noted, and no side effects were observed.\n\nThe authors concluded that fish oil supplementation appears to be a safe and effective way to prevent malnutrition among cancer patients, and may ultimately prove to be of benefit for other groups of people, such as elderly patients who also face a significant ongoing risk for muscle loss.\n\nLona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Dallas, reacted with cautious optimism to the findings.\n\n""Malnutrition is a big concern with cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation,"" she noted. ""Because first of all they do have wasting from the cancer itself, which is very metabolically active and eats up your energy stores. And then with chemotherapy, there is some inflammation that\'s detrimental to the heart and muscle, as it can cause muscle breakdown. And preservation of lean muscle tissue, we know, leads to better outcomes.""\n\n""So certainly this does seem to be promising,"" Sandon said. ""And other similar studies have looked at omega-3 and muscle preservation and have also suggested that fish oil can act to prevent inflammation caused by both disease and hardcore medications, like chemotherapy agents.""\n\n""But I would caution that the amount of pure concentrated fish oil supplement the people in this study were given is a lot,"" she added. ""Much much more than any recommended dietary allowance, along the lines of two to three servings of fish per week.""\n\nBut, she said, ""I would say this is certainly worthy of continuing research and exploration. But meanwhile, people should definitely not go out and start consuming huge amounts of fish oil.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on chemotherapy, visit the American Cancer Society.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Are we in this much of a rush to report from a news release on a very small, short-term study and say that it’s posted online when, in fact, it was not yet?  </span>","The story used quotes given in a news release – and was wrong in stating that the findings were already published in the Feb. 28 online edition of Cancer.

But it said there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against newer types of testing — including HPV tests and the “liquid-based” Pap tests that are now more often used than the old-fashioned version.\n\nDuring Pap tests, cells are swabbed or scraped from the cervix for examination under a microscope to find cancer or possible pre-cancerous changes. In the so-called liquid-based version, the cells are placed in special preservative liquid designed to make the specimen easier to “read”; those same cells can also be used for HPV testing (unlike the cells collected with conventional Pap tests).\n\nExactly what impact the new research review will have on the USPSTF recommendations is anyone's guess. A draft of the guidelines will not be published until Wednesday, when it will be available for public comment on the task force website (here: 1.usa.gov/4xXexl).\n\nA lot of research has been done since the 2003 recommendations, said Dr. Evelyn P. Whitlock, a senior investigator with Kaiser Permanente Northwest in Portland, Oregon, who led the review.\n\nBut there are still questions about the effects of HPV screening, and “more complete evidence” is needed before it becomes widely used, Whitlock and her colleagues write.\n\nHPV is a common virus that causes warts, including genital warts. Usually, the immune system clears the infection, but persistent infection with certain strains of HPV leads to cervical cancer in some women.\n\nSo in recent years, tests for those “high-risk” HPV strains have been developed to help in screening for the disease. A few HPV tests are approved for use, along with Pap tests, for screening women age 30 or older. (The tests are not approved for younger women because they give doctors little information; younger women commonly have HPV infections that go away on their own.)\n\nIt has not been clear exactly how HPV testing, or liquid-based Pap tests, measure up against standard Pap tests.\n\nIn their review, Whitlock’s team examined four clinical trials including more than 140,000 women that compared older Pap tests with the liquid-based version.\n\nThey found that both tests had nearly the same “sensitivity” — which refers to their ability to detect cancer or pre-cancer. The tests also had the same “specificity,” which can be used to measure how often a screening test produces false-positive results.\n\nAcross studies, the false-positive rate ranged between about six percent and 16 percent for both conventional and liquid-based Pap tests.\n\n“It’s reassuring to know that they perform equivalently,” Whitlock told Reuters Health.\n\nIn an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient’s. It may not even be the doctor’s — but may instead depend on whatever health system he or she is part of.\n\nSeveral other clinical trials in the review looked at HPV testing. In general, Whitlock’s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate.\n\nIn a 2003 trial of more than 3,000 women, for example, HPV testing caught 96 percent of potentially pre-cancerous growths, versus 65 percent with Pap tests. But the false-positive rate was 15 percent, compared with two percent with Pap testing.\n\nThe problem with that higher false-positive rate is that it could lead to needless biopsies and other tests, or treatment to remove abnormal-looking tissue.\n\n“It’s a tricky thing to get your mind around,” Whitlock said. “It may seem that if a test is more sensitive, it must be better. But it’s more subtle than that. You’re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.”\n\nSince cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what’s needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. How often, for example, does HPV testing lead to biopsies, versus Pap testing?\n\nAnd no one knows yet whether HPV testing actually catches cervical cancer at an earlier stage, or reduces deaths from the disease, compared with Pap tests.\n\nClinical trials are ongoing, Whitlock said. “The state of the science will be changing relatively quickly, so we’ll have to keep looking at this.”\n\nRight now, the American Cancer Society (ACS) and other medical groups recommend that women start Pap tests at age 21 or three years after they become sexually active, whichever comes first. Those should be done every one to two years until age 30; after age 30, women who’ve had three normal Pap tests in a row can be screened less often — every two to three years.\n\nPap plus HPV testing, done every three years, is considered a “reasonable option” for women age 30 and up, according to the ACS.\n\nWhitlock called Pap testing “one of the big public health success stories.”\n\nNationally, the cervical cancer death rate dropped by 70 percent between 1955 and 1992, and routine Pap testing is credited for most of that decline.\n\nBut many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out. It’s thought that more than half of cervical cancer cases in the U.S. occur in women who’ve never been screened, or haven’t been in the past five years.\n\nIf more women received the screening that already exists, “that would be a huge step forward,” Whitlock said.\n\nAn estimated 12,700 U.S. women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer this year, and nearly 4,300 will die from the disease, according to the ACS.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/atTzv0 Annals of Internal Medicine, online October 17, 2011.""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A sophisticated job of explaining the large review of four clinical trials involving 140,000 women, and why there remain questions that require further study.</span>","Questions remain – even though a large review was done to try to decide if women should get more than the typical cervical cancer screening, known as a Pap test.

While the newer techniques may have some advantages in some cases, they are not clearly better at diagnosing cancer early or proven to save lives, according to the reviewers. The story carefully explains the tricky landscape of test sensitivity and why it can lead to the risk of many falsely positive results.

On the plus side, the story conveyed some information about the drug’s availability. However, it didn’t didn’t say how much the drug costs, how long it extended survival, or what the potential harms might be.
It also passed along without scrutiny Merck’s assertion that this is the first time a drug of this type has helped those patients live longer.
We can anticipate Reuters reading our review and responding that their audience is different – it’s a business audience. Well, whether you’re flying in business class or coach, you may run into this story in the same way – by searching for Keytruda online.  And whether you’re an investor or a patient, some of your basic informational needs are the same.  And you didn’t get those needs answered in this piece.
The new trial results on Keytruda for digestive tract cancers haven’t been presented at a scientific conference yet, much less been submitted for peer review.
Too much, too soon.

But most of the success so far has been with blood cancers like lymphomas and leukemias. Immunotherapy, as it’s called, has yet to prove itself with solid tumors like breast, prostate, lung, colon and brain cancers.\n\nBut in a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers led by Dr. Behnam Badie from the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center say that the same immune-based therapy that is successful against blood cancers also helped a patient with advanced brain cancer.\n\nThe 50-year-old man with glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor, had already been treated with surgery, radiation and anti-tumor drug therapies. Despite these treatments, his cancer had returned and also spread to other parts of his brain and spinal cord. Badie and his team extracted immune cells from him, then engineered them to express proteins on their surface that would recognize and destroy glioblastoma tumor cells. After surgery to remove the bulk of the brain tumor, Badie and his colleagues directly injected the site with the modified immune cells (called chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR T cells) six times, and the remaining part of this tumor stopped growing.\n\nOther smaller growths in the brain continued to grow, however, so the patient received 10 more doses of the CAR T cells injected into the cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. This is the first time that immune cells have been injected into these brain regions, because introducing anything into the ventricles can cause dangerous and possibly deadly inflammation. The man did not develop such serious complications, however, and after about four months, these tumors too started to shrink. By six months, almost all had disappeared.\n\nIf the patient had not received the CAR T therapy, he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred, says Badie. But after being treated with the immune therapy, his cancer did not grow or recur for nearly eight months. “If we can do the same for other patients, that would be an amazing accomplishment that many decades of work and research on glioblastoma have never done,” says Badie, whose own father passed away a decade ago from glioblastoma.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips.

The tumors in the first patient remained under control for almost eight months, but the cancer returned after that in new parts of the brain. Badie says it’s not obvious why, but his analysis showed that these tumors did not contain much of the protein targeted by the CAR T cells that were injected. It’s possible that the immune cells had destroyed most of the cancer cells expressing the original protein, so other cancer cells with other proteins began to proliferate and survive.\n\nBadie is hoping to take advantage of this information and introduce immune cells with different tumor-targeting proteins. Eventually, these proteins would also be tailored to be specific to each patient’s cancer — a precision medicine approach to controlling cancer. These results are the first encouraging sign that the immunotherapy that is helping more people with blood cancer might also be effective for people with solid tumors like brain cancers.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]",The missing context: The study says very little scientifically because factors that accounted for the limited success and ultimate failure (the cancer came back) remain essentially unknown.,"This TIME.com story describes a single-patient clinical test of injections of modified immune cell proteins, a type of immunotherapy known as CAR-T cell therapy. It has had a few successes in blood cancers but essentially none in solid tumors, including those in the brain. Described in a report in The New England Journal of Medicine, the study was conducted and promoted by officials and physicians at the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center, an organization that has touted treatment as “miracles” and encouraged coverage of compelling individual cancer patient stories to support sometimes exaggerated claims of major advances in cancer treatment.
Unfortunately, this story carries a questionable headline (“Experimental Brain Cancer Treatment Is a Success”) and lacks any outside voices of moderation or caution about extrapolating lessons from a case study. In other words, this article could have done a much better job of contextual reporting. See our six tips for writing accurately about cancer immunotherapy drugs.
At least one other news story covering this same patient, appearing in STAT (see our review), did a better job of providing context and caution. Still, the value of reporting on these single cases remains in doubt.

""The possibility of getting almost all patients nearly clear and able to live their lives without the burden of this disease impacting them every day is getting close to reality.""\n\nPsoriasis is an immune-mediated disease that causes itchy, dry and red skin. It also increases a patient\'s risk for depression, heart disease and diabetes, among other conditions. The disease affects nearly 3 percent of the world\'s population, according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium, but about half of all patients with psoriasis do not get any treatment, Dr. Gordon said.\n\n""For patients, the concept that psoriasis is \'just something you live with\' is no longer appropriate,"" he said.\n\nIn the multi-center trial, 293 adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (defined as covering 10 percent or more of the body) were randomly assigned to receive varying doses of one of the two drugs or a placebo over 52 weeks.\n\nAt weeks 16 and 40, efficacy of the drugs was measured on a scale of 0 to 5. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the guselkumab group had a score of 0 (cleared psoriasis) or 1 (minimal psoriasis) in both the short and long term periods compared to the adalimumab and placebo groups. At week 40, for example, 81 percent of patients taking a 200-mg dose of guselkumab had a score of 0 or 1, compared to 49 percent of patients taking adalimumab.\n\nThe new drug works by blocking a protein specifically implicated in psoriasis, called interluekin 23; older drugs affect the immune process more generally.\n\n""Building on multiple layers of clinical and basic research, we are changing our understanding of how psoriasis works,"" Dr. Gordon said. ""By doing so, we are able to build new treatments that specifically target the immunological processes of psoriasis while leaving even more of the normal immune system intact.""\n\nAn ongoing phase III trial is continuing to test the safety and efficacy of guselkumab as a psoriasis treatment.\n\n###\n\nThis study was supported by Janssen Research and Development, the manufacturer of guselkumab. Dr. Gordon is a former paid consultant for Janssen Research and Development.']","This university news release on a psoriasis treatment trial trumpets benefits, while side-stepping study limitations.","The news release announces the results of a phase II clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which found that an experimental drug called guselkumab was more effective than a drug already on the market (called adalimumab) at controlling the symptoms of psoriasis. However, the release leaves some significant gaps, not giving readers any information about potential harms or costs associated with guselkumab. The release falls victim to the common practice of hyperbole in its headline.  This was a phase II trial in a relatively small number of subjects.  Suggesting that guselkumab is both more effective and less toxic than adalimumab is nothing more than speculation at this juncture.  A more appropriate title would have been, “Early phase II trial suggests that new psoriasis drug may be more effective and has the potential to leave more of normal immune system intact.”

The tightly packed network of cells in brain capillaries only lets certain substances through, such as key nutrients, making brain-based disorders difficult to treat with drugs.\n\n1 Million The number of Americans with Parkinson\'s disease, a progressive, degenerative brain disorder with no cure.\n\nMedtronic, the largest stand-alone medical-device maker, already has a handful of other Parkinson\'s collaborations underway. The company is also working through home-grown efforts and collaborations on potential treatments for other brain diseases, like Alzheimer\'s and Huntington\'s.\n\nThe latest effort with Lilly is still many years from yielding a marketable treatment or even starting human testing. The companies didn\'t disclose terms of their agreement, but a Medtronic spokesman said it spans early research through product development and potential commercialization.\n\nParkinson\'s is a progressive, degenerative brain disorder that affects nearly one million Americans and can lead to tremors and other movement problems, according to the Parkinson\'s Disease Foundation. The disease, which has no cure, is thought to be caused by the death of neurons that produce the important chemical messenger dopamine. Lilly\'s treatment approach involves a modified form of a protein called glial cell derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF, which is designed to protect these neurons.\n\nSeven years ago, Amgen Inc. stopped studying a potential GDNF Parkinson\'s treatment delivered with Medtronic equipment because it didn\'t appear effective. But Lilly hopes its compound, together with Medtronic\'s modernized delivery system, will ""overcome some prior technical hurdles,"" said Ros Smith, senior research director of regenerative biology at Lilly. The company believes its GDNF variant has potential to have broader distribution in the brain than prior versions.\n\nThe drug may not enter human clinical trials for up to five years, Dr. Smith said.\n\nMedtronic\'s system involves small catheters that are implanted in the brain and connected to a hockey-puck-size pump, which would likely be implanted in the abdomen.

That approach is used to treat Parkinson\'s symptoms, Dr. Oesterle said. By contrast, drug approaches from Lilly and other companies have potential to restore damaged parts of the brain, he said.\n\nThe key is getting the drugs on site, rather than having them circulate through the body only to be stymied by the blood-brain barrier.\n\nMedtronic also has partnerships with small drug developers Neurologix Inc. and privately held NeuroNova AB of Sweden on potential Parkinson\'s treatments.\n\n—Peter Loftus and Matt Jarzemsky contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@dowjones.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">We applaud the appropriately cautious tone and context provided in this story – a good example of how health care business stories can address most of our criteria. </span>","Reporters of some business stories we’ve evaluated say that our criteria aren’t fair to or shouldn’t be applied to business stories – that some health care industry business announcements may be incomplete but are still newsworthy.  We have no disagreement with that latter statement.  However, it is the framing of the news coverage at such times that is worth scrutinizing.

Still Safe.,"['A scourge we can eliminate, if we choose wisely: the human papillomavirus. Photo by the Laboratory of Tumor Virus Biology\n\nThrough an article in Forbes I saw that a new study has been published about the safety of Gardasil, a vaccine for prevention of certain strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV.\n\nHPV is a virus that can lead to genital warts, many types of cancer, and cervical cancer in women, which kills 4,000 women every year in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe Gardasil vaccine, on the other hand, caused some people to faint after getting it, and others got mild skin infections—both of which occur somewhat rarely with other vaccines too, as you might expect.\n\nWhich sounds worse to you?\n\nThe study, published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, looked at the published data about effects from the vaccine and found that it has a “favorable safety profile.” This study comes after many other previous studies that show essentially the same thing. There is no correlation between getting the Gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as “autoimmune diseases (including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and multiple sclerosis), anaphylaxis, venous thromboembolism, and stroke.”\n\nMind you, all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it. And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong.\n\nThat doesn’t stop them from making them, or from them getting attention by mainstream media; attention they most assuredly do not deserve.\n\nIt’s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. For example, a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine, and it got a lot of press, but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it’s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. But as the saying goes, correlation is not causation. The vaccines are not to blame here.\n\nEven more frustrating about this vaccine is that it’s being fought by an unusual group of people; while most anti-vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion, Gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous, because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nHowever, this has been shown to be false. Worse, these same people tend to promote abstinence-only education, which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education; kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more STIs than ones who are taught progressive, healthy sex ed.\n\nIt’s like Bizarro world, where everything is backward. All the evidence shows Gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses. It also shows that the claims made by anti-vaxxers are wrong, and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse.\n\nAnd yet they dig in. They insist real science is wrong, that their anecdotes are better, that the entire medical industry is on the take (which is silly beyond reason).\n\nBut that’s where we are. When it comes to health issues, especially ones tied to sexuality, reason goes out the window and emotions take over.\n\nThat’s why I am very, very clear about this: I and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations, and my daughter has had all three stages of the Gardasil vaccine (we’d have done that if she had been a boy, too). As a parent, as someone who knows and loves someone with an autoimmune disorder, and as a person who knows just how truly awful so many diseases are and how easily and safely they can be prevented, I am a strong advocate for vaccinations.\n\nIt’s your body, but it affects literally everyone around you. Don’t listen to the anti-vaxxers, who just want to scare you. Get the facts. And please, talk to your board-certified doctor and find out if there are any vaccinations you need.\n\nHow many lives will you save when you do?\n\nTip o’ the virion to the Refutations of Anti-Vaccine Memes group on Facebook.']","It’s hard to argue with the conclusion here, but the messaging would have been stronger with some numbers and an independent expert voice.","This op-ed-style piece about the safety of the Gardasil vaccine is to be commended for paying attention to a study with negative findings. Negative studies aren’t as sexy as research that reports amazing or frightening new effects from medical interventions, but the mundane finding of “no difference” is often the reality of medical research and a result that readers need to hear about more often.
The message here is sound, but we wish the story had followed some practices that would have buttressed the author’s viewpoint and thereby made the piece more useful for readers. These include: quantifying the benefits of the vaccine and its cost; describing the results of the study that’s the basis for the piece and the quality of evidence it reports; and seeking out an independent voice to comment on the findings.

Those who had used nicotine patches, gum, inhalers or nasal sprays were just as likely to relapse as those who had quit without them, researchers from Harvard University and the University of Massachusetts found.\n\nThe findings run counter to the results of several randomized clinical trials conducted before the Food and Drug Administration gave the thumbs-up to these nicotine replacement products in the 1990s. In those trials, volunteers using such products were up to three times more likely to kick the smoking habit.\n\nBut the latest results are in line with other studies that have found little — if any — benefit from the products when used by smokers in real life. In some cases, studies have found that people who use products like nicotine patches and gums are more likely to relapse than their counterparts who go cold turkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This may indicate that some heavily dependent smokers perceive NRT [nicotine replacement therapy] as a sort of ‘magic’ pill, and, upon realizing it is not, they find themselves without support in their quitting efforts, doomed to failure,” the researchers wrote.\n\nThe new study examined former smokers three times over a five-year period. At the midpoint of the study, 30.6% of recent quitters had gone back to smoking. By the end, 31.3% had relapsed.\n\nAmerican smokers spend more than $1.5 billion on nicotine gum, patches and related products each year, according to the study. Much of that comes from public health programs, which are facing further rounds of budget cuts. Policymakers ought to rethink their willingness to pay for nicotine replacement therapy, the researchers wrote, and consider shifting that money to initiatives aimed at discouraging smoking in general, such as anti-smoking campaigns and efforts to raise tobacco taxes.\n\nBut GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, which makes Nicorette, Nicoderm, Commit lozenges and other smoking cessation products, said that would be premature. The company noted that most of the adults in the study who used nicotine replacement products didn’t use them for the recommended eight weeks. Had those people followed directions, they might have had more success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Hundreds of clinical trials involving more than 35,000 participants and extensive consumer use for more than 20 years have proven both the efficacy and safety of NRT when used as directed,” the company said in a statement. “NRT products have helped millions of smokers quit by gradually weaning them off of their tobacco addiction and is recommended as a first-line therapy for quitting.”\n\nkaren.kaplan@latimes.com']","Of the three stories we reviewed on this study, this one was the weakest.","It fell short by failing to tap any independent sources for commentary and perspective on the findings, by failing to compare the nicotine products to any alternatives for smoking cessation and by relying too heavily on a drugmaker’s press release.

She roamed from Chinatown to the Upper East Side, went sightseeing in Central Park and painted the town with her husband of 33 years, their two 20-something children and assorted friends.\n\nOne evening, they found themselves at Del Posto, a chic Italian restaurant. Glancing at her watch, over the sparkle of conversation, wine glasses and half-eaten dessert, Gilbert marveled at the time: just a few minutes to midnight.\n\n""It was awfully late for me,"" she laughed as she told the story. ""It was just a great moment to know that I was holding up enough to be there, to feel great and make memories.""\n\nLate-night hours, any hours, are especially precious to Gilbert, who could have been forgiven for feeling just a bit weary. For 15 years, she\'s been fighting breast cancer.\n\nAfter years of ups and downs, Gilbert is doing well and gives most of the credit to her most recent medicine: bevacizumab, better known by its brand name, Avastin. But gratitude is tinged with worry, because the Food and Drug Administration is considering the unusual step of revoking its approval of Avastin as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer.\n\n""It\'s disheartening, and it\'s a scary thought,"" says Gilbert. ""Until just recently, I didn\'t know it was so precarious.""\n\nAvastin, which works by cutting off a tumor\'s blood supply, was first approved as a cancer treatment in 2004 as a therapy for colon cancer. Since then, it has also been approved as a treatment for certain types of lung, kidney and brain cancer.\n\nIn 2008, the FDA granted Avastin what\'s known as accelerated approval as a therapy for metastatic breast cancer. The move was based on preliminary studies that found the drug increased the time that patients went without symptoms getting worse. As a condition of the approval, the company that makes Avastin -- Genentech -- agreed to conduct more extensive research.\n\nThe results of those two larger trials, known as RIBBON-1 and AVADO, were made public this year, and to some, they were disappointing. In RIBBON-1, time without symptoms getting worse, known as progression-free survival, or PFS, improved by less than three months.\n\nIn AVADO, it improved by just 24 days. In neither study did patients actually live longer, and there was a high rate of side effects, including high blood pressure and internal bleeding.\n\nIn July, an FDA advisory panel voted 12-1 to recommend revoking the preliminary approval. The FDA promises a final decision by September 17.\n\nGilbert had just passed her 40th birthday when she felt a lump in her breast. It was cancer.\n\nShe had it removed, went through a round of radiation and chemotherapy, and was symptom-free for the next nine years.\n\n""I almost describe it as the little c,"" is how she tells it today. ""When I got the recurrence, it was the Big C. It was a real surprise when it came back again.""\n\nThis time, the signal was pain underneath her armpit. Tests revealed several small tumors in the bone.\n\nDoctors told Gilbert she\'d be lucky to be alive in five years, but with chemotherapy and radiation, she fought off the cancer, again. A year later, she watched her daughter Neely perform her senior dance recital, and not long after, walk across the stage to collect her high school diploma.\n\n""All those things you take for granted,"" Gilbert says. ""I was just so blessed to see her graduate.""\n\nBut chemotherapy took a toll. At one point, Gilbert was hospitalized several days with a low white blood cell count and high fevers.\n\nA few years later, she felt chest pains, and doctors thought she was having a heart attack. As it turned out, Gilbert had no heart damage, but there were days she was so exhausted she couldn\'t leave the house.\n\nLate last spring, tests at Duke University found signs of cancer in her liver. Dr. Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at Duke, put her on Avastin, along with Navelbine, another chemotherapy drug. Gilbert says the combination stopped her illness in its tracks.\n\nBecause Avastin is approved to treat other cancers, losing the breast cancer indication would not, technically, remove it from a doctor\'s toolkit. But here\'s the catch: Avastin costs more than $8,000 a month. At that price, insurance coverage is crucial, and patients and doctors fear that an FDA reversal will lead to most insurers no longer signing the checks.\n\nSusan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the Association of Health Insurance Plans, the largest trade group, said insurers would wait for guidance from the FDA, but adds, ""If the FDA pulls back its approval for this particular indication, it would trigger a review of plan policies. Policies get reviewed whenever there is additional information.""\n\nThe issue has split advocates for breast cancer patients. Susan G. Komen For the Cure, the largest group, issued a statement in support of Avastin and has helped to circulate a petition asking that it still be made available. But Fran Visco of the National Breast Cancer Coalition says Avastin should not have been approved in the first place.\n\n""There was a delay in progression of the tumor, but it had no effect on quality of life, or survival,"" Visco says. ""I favor a strong FDA. We need some oversight body to say whether something is effective. You can\'t rely on industry to do that, or individual physicians.""\n\nVisco says the new studies on Avastin, AVADO and RIBBON-1, should settle the issue.\n\n""It\'s got no impact on survival, and there are troubling side effects. We\'re supposed to be excited about a delay in tumor progression, for a month? That\'s sad.""\n\nBut Blackwell, the Duke oncologist, says the medicine can be used safely as long as patients are carefully monitored. Marcia Gilbert has had no significant side effects since starting on Avastin. If it\'s not available, Blackwell says, ""I\'m going to have to give older drugs with the exact same toxicity. And they\'ve never been shown to improve overall survival, either.""\n\nBlackwell says the FDA risks setting the bar too high. ""If the [Avastin] label is not upheld, it sets a new standard. We\'re not going to see another first-line drug for another 10 years, at least.""\n\nAnother breast cancer specialist, Dr. Edith Perez, deputy director of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center in Jacksonville, Florida, says many chemotherapy drugs, such as Gemzar -- which is substantially less expensive than Avastin -- have previously been approved without showing they can lengthen survival.\n\nThe issue has been taken up by critics of the health care overhaul signed into law last year. In late July, Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote a letter to the FDA saying that there are no new safety concerns and that ""the [FDA advisory] committee\'s concerns appear to have been based on cost-effectiveness.""

In December, an FDA advisory panel will decide if it should revoke the approval of the drug Avastin for treating metastatic breast cancer based on the results of two major trials suggesting that the serious side effects outweigh the time that patients live without the disease getting worse. This story met many of our criteria, but failed to provide important details about the trials, including the patient population and how many women developed serious side effects in each treatment group. While the story included various viewpoints on whether this drug should continue to be used as a first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer, it focused largely on the drug’s success in just one patient.

A slice of fast food pizza has 2,074 micrograms of lycopene. A tablespoon of catsup has 2,146 micrograms of lycopene.\n\nLycopene is also found in watermelon, grapefruit, papaya and mango.\n\nThere are no government recommendations specific to lycopene consumption, but U.S. dietary guidelines have traditionally recommended Americans consume at least five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day. In 2010, the U.S. updated its dietary guidelines, stating Americans should ""increase"" fruit and vegetable intake, noting that at least 2½ cups of fruits and vegetables per day was associated with a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes. There have also been some studies that suggest lycopene can cut the risk of prostate and other types of cancer.\n\nDr. Rafael Ortiz, director of the Center for Stroke and Neuro-Endovascular Surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, who wasn\'t involved in the lycopene study, said it shows ""diet is very important"" for cutting stroke risk along with exercising and not smoking.

The approach appears to produce significantly better outcomes for patients than the conventional practice of waiting up to three days before operating on the fracture. It can also reduce the costs of complications and longer hospital stays.\n\nFast-track hospitals also are providing follow-up care in special geriatric fracture clinics that steer patients through rehabilitation, provide treatment to strengthen bones and help them return to independent living.\n\nMartha Aldredge, 76, fell and fractured her hip in April while looking for a seat at her granddaughter’s high school concert near Greenville, S.C. Photo: Amy A. Chapman\n\nAn estimated 340,000 older adults suffer hip fractures in the U.S. annually, and many of them have other medical issues such as high blood pressure or heart disease. Doctors and surgeons have taken the position that fractures weren’t true emergencies, and studies suggested delaying surgery allows more time to evaluate patients and stabilize other conditions before giving them medical clearance for an operation.\n\nBut a review of more than 2 million patients led by researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, and published last year in the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma, found that compared with same-day surgery, each additional day of delay was associated with a significantly higher overall complication rate. And surgery two days and three or more days after admission was associated with higher rates of death.\n\nThe deaths are a combination of “complications related to the hip fracture and surgery, and overall decline in health that seems to be hastened after hip fracture,” says Dr. Joseph Zuckerman, study co-author and chair of Orthopaedic Surgery at NYU Langone.\n\n“We have to start thinking differently, and treat a hip fracture with the same urgency as a heart attack or a stroke,” says Philip J. Devereaux, a cardiologist and researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He says delays can cause the physical trauma of a fracture to spark inflammatory responses in the body that increase stress on the heart and the immune system and increase risk for complications.\n\nDr. Devereaux, who also heads a surgical research group at McMaster’s Population Health Research Institute, is leading a large international trial, called Hip Attack, which will enroll up to 3,000 patients in 20 countries. The study will compare surgery within 6 hours for a hip fracture against standard care, typically surgery 24 hours after diagnosis. The aim is to determine the impact of accelerated surgery on death, heart attack, stroke, infection, and major bleeding. A pilot study in 2013, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, suggested patients receiving accelerated surgery had a 40% lower risk of major complications.\n\nAn X-ray of Martha Aldredge’s fractured hip. Photo: Bon Secours St. Francis Health System\n\nMs. Aldredge’s doctor inserted a long y-shaped rod in the femur bone from her hip to her knee. Photo: Bon Secours St. Francis Health System\n\nIt took just one missed step for Martha Aldredge, 76, to fall and fracture her hip one evening last April while looking for a seat at her granddaughter’s high school concert near Greenville, S.C. Though bystanders helped her up and she managed to sit through the concert, she wasn’t able to walk when it was over. After being helped into a rolling chair, a friend drove her to the emergency room of the Bon Secours St. Francis Health System’s Eastside campus in Greenville.\n\nAn X-ray showed the hip was badly fractured, so she was transferred by ambulance to the St. Francis Hospital in downtown Greenville where orthopedic surgeon Michael O’Boyle oversees the Osteoporotic Fracture Program dedicated to the care of older patients with hip fractures.\n\nIn the OR the next day at 5 p.m., Dr. O’Boyle inserted a long y-shaped rod in the femur bone from her hip to her knee. Ms. Aldredge stayed on an orthopedic floor for three days before being transferred to a rehabilitation floor for four more days.\n\n“They made me walk right away, which turned out to be a great thing,” Ms. Aldredge says. Dr. O’Boyle’s team told her about the importance of building up muscle and she started outpatient physical therapy a week later, going two days a week for three months. She was able to stop using a walker and, after a break from therapy, is continuing for several more sessions to build her stamina. She is back to driving herself, and says her bones are in good enough shape that she doesn’t anticipate future problems.\n\nDr. O’Boyle says it took a major cultural change to provide such care at St. Francis. In the past, he says, hip fracture patients were triaged as non-urgent cases in the ER, where they waited on average for eight hours, and then might wait nearly three more days for surgery, scheduled as a “waiting list” case. Patients were given heavy narcotics for pain, which contributed to a problem known as postoperative delirium for close to 80% of them, leading to longer hospital stays. There was little coordination of care among doctors, nurses and social workers to ensure good follow up care, and patients and families were often anxious due to poor communication. “We were not doing a good job, and the results were abysmal,” Dr. O’Boyle says.\n\nThe fracture clinic has helped improve results. The team coordinates care with emergency medical services to make sure patients don’t get too many narcotics and fluids before they arrive at the hospital. Time in the ER has been cut in half, and most cases are in surgery within 14 to 19 hours.\n\nSince 2007, hospital stays have been reduced to less than four days from more than eight days. The delirium rate has been cut to 10%, and 75% of patients return to independent living. The mortality rate one-year postoperatively is less than 18%, according to Dr. O’Boyle. And patient and family satisfaction scores are at nearly 100%.\n\nThe clinic also coordinates care after discharge with rehabilitation programs, which it had not done in the past, to ensure patients follow its post-op instructions and are closely monitored during physical therapy sessions. Dr. Boyle’s team also evaluates and treats patients for osteoporosis and provides education on nutrition, falls prevention and exercise programs.\n\n“We took an injury that was neglected and pushed off to the side with no sense of urgency and made it a priority, “Dr. O’Boyle says.\n\nWrite to Laura Landro at laura.landro@wsj.com']","But, overall the story provides a fairly solid overview of where medicine is at on this issue, letting readers know this is an evolving process.","This is a feature story about the potential benefits in treating hip fractures as a critical emergency, and providing “fast-track” access to surgery to improve outcomes. As the story indicates, limited research so far shows that waiting more than a day or so leads to a higher risk of complications and death.
This story covered a lot of the basics, giving readers an overview of where the research stands, and why doctors hypothesize this method is better. That said, it could have emphasized that surgery is still surgery, and while this approach may reduce complications, there are still risks. More also was needed on the measured benefits and general availability of this option.

""It\'s a disease where we\'re desperately looking for new therapies.""\n\nLung cancer kills more Americans than any other type of cancer, nearly 160,000 last year.\n\nThe new trial looked at a type of lung cancer called squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 20%-30% of lung cancers.\n\nThere have been no other recent treatment breakthroughs in squamous cancer, which most commonly occurs in smokers or former smokers, so this advance is particularly welcome, said Janne.\n\nJanne, also a professor at Harvard Medical School, said more research is needed before lung cancer patients should be routinely treated with Opdivo, Keytruda or similar drugs.\n\n""I think it\'s a little premature to start treating people today,"" he said, ""but I don\'t think we\'re far away from that.""\n\nIn December, the Food and Drug Administration approved Opdivo to treat advanced melanoma, a type of skin cancer that used to be considered a death sentence.\n\nOpdivo and others in its class work by removing a brake that cancer puts on the immune system. In some patients, just removing the brake is enough to allow the person\'s immune system to fight and contain the cancer. For other patients, researchers expect other drugs will be needed, too.\n\nIn addition to melanoma and lung cancer, this brake-release approach has been shown effective in early trials against bladder, kidney, head and neck cancers, and some blood cancers.\n\n""We are feeling more and more confident that we are on the cusp of a treatment revolution,"" said Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, which has its own, similar drug called Keytruda.\n\nMerck is also studying Keytruda in people with advanced lung cancer to better understand how they are responding to treatment, what determines how well a patient will respond, and how to get good results for more patients, Perlmutter said.\n\nExisting treatments – chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and so-called targeted therapies – can help beat back tumors, but once cancer has spread, it almost always returns. Immune therapy drugs offer the possibility that the immune system will keep cancer in check indefinitely.\n\nBut there are still a lot of unanswered questions about immune therapy.\n\n""It is early days for the successes of immune therapy,"" said Mark Fishman, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, a research arm of drug company Novartis, which is taking a different approach to turning the immune system against cancer.

The company offered very (very) little data on the results, and this story highlights the limitations of reporting on a drug trial when there is very little information available about the drug trial. Although the story talks to several sources, it tells readers very little about the potential costs, quantifiable benefits, risks associated with the drug, or the quality of the evidence. The story also offers only a hazy quote about when the treatment will become available, which could be interpreted as later this year or some time next decade. Frankly, the story leaves a lot of very important questions unanswered, or offers only nebulous answers.

A final decision is expected by the end of June, according to the documents.\n\nXarelto (rivaroxaban) is one of a new class of blood thinners that have been developed to overcome some of the problems that exist with the standard treatment, warfarin (Coumadin), which requires constant dose monitoring. Warfarin\'s effectiveness also can be altered by certain foods and other medications. Xarelto already is approved for use by those with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and by people who are having hip- or knee-replacement surgery.\n\nIn the FDA briefing documents, an agency reviewer recommended approving the drug for treatment of acute coronary syndrome, mostly because trial data showed there was a reduction in cardiovascular death, even though there was also an increased risk of potentially fatal bleeding.\n\n""However, what is not reflected in the sponsor\'s analysis are minor bleeding events,"" FDA reviewer Dr. Karen Hicks wrote in the briefing documents. ""While it is true that these bleeding events typically do not lead to death or irreversible harm, these events may represent the biggest problem for both patients and health care providers if rivaroxaban is approved.""\n\n""While reductions in [cardiovascular] death still trump these bleeding events, if rivaroxaban is approved, we should expect a number of bleeding events that will require medical attention,"" Hicks wrote.

Some doctors are starting to tell at least some of their patients to stop taking the drugs for a time — in other words, to take a ""drug holiday.""\n\n\n\nThat strategy is a tough sell for consumers who have been bombarded with osteoporosis medication advertisements for years.\n\n\n\nWhen osteoporosis drugs first came out, ""people thought, this is a recurring disease, like high blood pressure. So why wouldn\'t you treat it for the rest of their lives?"" said Dr. Richard Eastell, an expert in bone metabolism at the University of Sheffield in Britain who spoke about the issue last month at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ""But there are now some anxieties with long-term use.""\n\n\n\nSeveral factors are merging to usher in a new era of caution surrounding the medications. One is the simple acknowledgment that some people are approaching 10 to 15 years of continuous use.\n\n\n\n""Worldwide, it\'s a commonly discussed question as to how long you should go on with these treatments,"" Eastell said. ""Beyond 10 years, we have no knowledge of how these treatments work.""\n\n\n\nAdded to that, several potential risks from long-term use have recently arisen.\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, people taking bisphosphonates — which include Fosamax, Boniva, Actonel and Reclast — can develop jaw necrosis, a condition in which the jawbone begins to deteriorate. And a study published in September in the British Medical Journal found that people who take bisphosphonate drugs for several years have a slightly higher risk of developing esophageal cancer.\n\n\n\nExperts don\'t know why the drugs would increase the cancer risk, although they are known to irritate the esophagus in some people.\n\n\n\nOf most concern, however, is that long-term bisphosphonate users can develop rare and unusual fractures in the thigh bone, or femur. A 2008 study first linked long-term use of the medications to femur fractures, and other research has confirmed the link. On Oct. 13, the Food and Drug Administration announced it will now require bisphosphonate drugs to carry information on their labels describing the risk of rare femur fractures.\n\n\n\nWithout a lot of clear scientific evidence to guide them, doctors are debating how long people should take bisphosphonates and whether occasional ""drug holidays"" are a good idea.\n\n\n\nBones grow and change. After reaching peak bone mass in the early or mid-20s, bone density begins to decline because old bone is lost faster than new bone is made. This process speeds up in midlife, especially after menopause in women.\n\n\n\nBisphosphonates work by preventing the body from reabsorbing bone. They slow bone loss but also interfere with the natural bone-remodeling cycle, the process by which old bone is continually broken down and new bone is fashioned to replace it. This interference, it\'s thought, lies behind the unusual fracture risk. And some bone specialists believe that leaving bones free of drugs for a year or more in people with osteoporosis allows the bone-remodeling process to kick in again.\n\n\n\nDrug holidays may also be justified, these specialists say, because bisphosphonate medications remain in bone tissue for a year or two after people stop taking them. A study in 2006 followed postmenopausal women who took Fosamax for five years, at which point half of the women stopped taking the drugs and half continued. At the end of the 10-year period, there was no difference in fracture rates among the two groups.\n\n\n\n""To give high doses indefinitely is not what you want to do,"" said Dr. Ian Reid, an endocrinologist and bone expert at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. ""After five years, it\'s a good time to reassess. If the bones don\'t show osteoporosis, we typically stop the drug and monitor bone density. If they still have osteoporosis readings or have had a fracture, we keep them on medications for out to 10 years.""\n\n\n\nPeople who still have osteoporosis also have the option of switching to a different class of drug. One is the parathyroid hormone drug teriparatide (sold under the brand name Forteo), which, unlike the bisphosphonates, works by actively building bone. Another is the new medication denosumab (brand name Prolia), which is in a drug class known as the RANK ligand inhibitors. As the name suggests, it suppresses bone breakdown by inactivating a protein called the RANK ligand. It\'s too early to tell if long-term Prolia use causes some of the same side effects as bisphosphonates.\n\n\n\nSelective estrogen receptor molecules also help preserve bone mass. Some of these drugs, including raloxifene and tamoxifen, are primarily used to treat breast cancer after menopause.\n\n\n\nIt\'s possible that the order in which patients take specific medications affects their safety and effectiveness. A study published last week in the journal Cell Stem Cell suggests that new bone formation may be enhanced if a parathyroid hormone is administered before a bisphosphonate.\n\n\n\nDoctors are definitely pulling back from prescribing osteoporosis medications for people who have some bone loss but do not meet the diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis, said Dr. Felicia Cosman, clinical director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation. This milder condition is sometimes referred to as osteopenia.\n\n\n\n""It\'s ironic that many of these cases of femur factures were in women with mild bone loss who probably should not have been on these drugs,"" Cosman said. ""We probably used too many bisphosphonates in too many women for too many years. But it\'s not that we should stop it in everyone. The therapy has to be individualized.""\n\n\n\nDoctors who want to reassess the use of osteoporosis medications may have to do battle with advertisers who won\'t let people with the disease forget they have it. The osteoporosis drug market was valued at $9.6 billion last year and is expected to double within 10 years. One popular bisphosphonate drug, Boniva, is among the top 20 most heavily advertised prescription drugs, according to the market research firms SDI and Kantar Media Research.\n\n\n\nStill, under-use of osteoporosis drugs remains a bigger problem than overuse, Cosman said. One large study of osteoporosis patients found almost half had stopped taking their medications within the first year after diagnosis.\n\n\n\n""It\'s been difficult to convince people to take drugs,"" she said. ""Now some are more skeptical that these drugs are providing the benefits that we said they did. We need to be clear that a two- to five-year course of these drugs saves fractures, pain, disability and life. There is just no question about that.""\n\n\n\nshari.roan@latimes.com']","This story attempted to present a thorough and careful analysis of the evidence surrounding bisphosphonates, but we wish it had taken a little more care in analyzing the quality of that evidence, in presenting cost information and in identifying conflicts of interest.","This story about drug treatments for osteoporosis positions itself as a careful re-analysis of the benefits and harms of a class of drugs known as bisphosphonates. So we were surprised to find that this story suffers from some of the same deficiencies that typically plague boosterish puff pieces. Particularly problematic in this story is the lack of quantitative data. We learn that the use of bisphosphonate drugs is becoming more limited due to increasing awareness of frightening side effects, such as cancer and jaw necrosis. Yet there is no accounting in the story of how often these harms occur or how effective the drugs are for preventing fractures. There also were significant gaps in the coverage of costs and in the disclosure of potential financial conflicts. Despite its considerable shortcomings, the story gets credit for framing the issue in an appropriately cautious way and for soliciting a variety of expert perspectives. Readers should come away from the story with a generally accurate, if incomplete, understanding of the issue.

But does it work?,"['Brynne Henn, 26, leaned back onto a pristine white couch and settled white-and-red headphones over her ears. She picked up a handset, grasping one buzzer in each hand, closed her eyes, and the session began.\n\nThe room was quiet. Through the headphones, Henn heard an alternating tone — first in the right ear, then the left, back and forth. The handset buzzed in synchrony, right-left-right-left, part of a trauma treatment that also involves recalling painful memories. She turned her thoughts to the day her brother, Nate, died.\n\nNate Henn had been visiting relatives and working with Invisible Children, a nonprofit in Kampala, Uganda. On July 11, 2010, he was at a sports complex with friends, enjoying the broadcast of a World Cup soccer match, when terrorists struck. Nate was only 25 when shrapnel from a bomb ended his life.\n\nThe years hadn’t diminished Brynne Henn’s pain.\n\n“ ‘Your brother’s dead, and you need to come home to take care of your mom,’ ” she remembered her father saying. With those simple words, her brother was gone — and she felt compelled to take control in the ensuing chaos. Henn, who had been visiting her boyfriend in Chapel Hill, immediately returned home to Raleigh, N.C.\n\n“I didn’t stop for the first week after Nate died,” she said.\n\nThe ordeal didn’t end with the news of Nate’s death. Her other brother, Kyle, rushed home from Delaware to be with the family. But the private plane carrying him crashed the next day in nearby Chapel Hill. The pilot was killed and the co-pilot was seriously injured, but Kyle survived.\n\n“And then the media storm went crazy,” Henn said. The family already had received inquiries from journalists about Nate’s death; Kyle’s brush with death only intensified the interest of media outlets from Philadelphia to Raleigh.\n\n“It made it so much worse,” Henn said. At age 20, she began functioning as the family spokeswoman. “I felt like I had to protect my family from all of it,” she said. She occupied herself with press inquiries and funeral arrangements. But after the whirlwind passed, unaddressed grief remained with her.\n\nComplicated grief\n\nWhen a person experiences trauma, the associated memories can remain as vivid and urgent as on the day the event happened. The brain perceives the trauma as happening in the present and reacts accordingly, even in safe situations.\n\nWhen Henn’s traumatic memories of her brother’s violent death were triggered, they “popped” and glowed in her mind as if they were being shown on a projector screen.\n\n“All these memories around me started playing like a video loop,” Henn said. Her body remembered the sensations vividly: the heat and discomfort of the summer day, the pain of her high heels as she delivered the eulogy at the funeral.\n\nHenn did cognitive behavioral therapy — a form of conventional talk therapy — for five years.\n\n“It helped me realize feelings were normal,” she explained, and that she was not weak for reeling from the tragedy. “But I never felt like I was getting over it.” Random memories could send her spiraling into panic and fear. Talk therapy helped her manage those attacks, but it didn’t address the root cause.\n\nHenn was initially diagnosed with a condition known as complicated grief; she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder only last year. She was surprised. She had thought of PTSD as an affliction of soldiers and others directly involved in horrendous events — not of people like her, suffering from the ripple effects of a bombing in Uganda.\n\nIt was Kyle Henn, recovering from his own PTSD after surviving the plane crash, who recommended eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, or EMDR.\n\nPsychologist Francine Shapiro developed EMDR in 1987. Three years later, she founded the EMDR Institute, which has trained more than 100,000 practitioners.\n\nSome therapists use sounds from headphones during a session. Others use eye movement, moving a finger or object back and forth as the patient follows, eyes moving left to right and back again. Others employ a bar on which small bulbs light up from one side to another.\n\nPatients follow the light or object with their eyes or listen to the alternating tone while thinking about a specific traumatic memory or series of memories. They describe the memories to the therapist, who gives guidance as needed.\n\nThe idea is that reliving the memories helps remove the sting and that the urgency of the memories can be reduced as the brain begins to move them from short-term to long-term memory. The sound or the eye movement is supposed to activate both sides of the brain in an imitation of REM sleep, when the brain usually converts short-term memories into long-term recollections.\n\nStudies have found benefits to EMDR. But there is debate about whether the eye movement makes a difference, said Stephen Holland, founder of the Capital Institute for Cognitive Therapy and co-author of the textbook “Treatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders.” “The question is whether stimulation adds to it.” He does not use it in his practice because he considers it no more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nBrynne Henn, who lives in the District, began seeing a licensed clinical psychologist who practices EMDR last September. In Gail Kalin’s office, nestled in a tree-shaded apartment building in Northwest Washington, Henn confronted the trauma that still haunted her.\n\nThe techniques associated with EMDR may merely have a placebo effect, some psychologists say. In early sessions, Henn focused on the headphones and handset; they helped distract her from the terror of reliving the traumatic events surrounding her brother’s death, she said. This distraction had a positive effect on her, she said, allowing her to dive deeply into the therapy without freezing in the face of fear.\n\nSome insurance plans cover EMDR. Henn’s does not; she pays for the sessions out of pocket.\n\nHenn, who is a communications associate at a Washington research institution, was initially very skeptical of EMDR.\n\n“It is so weird,” she said. “When I first got there and she hands me these two paddles that vibrate in my hands, and then [I] put on these giant headphones — I was, like: What is this, a hearing test? What are we doing?”\n\nBut Henn was encouraged by the progress she made. “I started getting really interested in it,” she said. “Why is my brain coming up with this? What in the world are you doing to me, that this is what I came up with?” Henn was surprised by the vivid memories — some of which she hadn’t known existed — that resurfaced after so much time had passed.\n\nReliving the memories\n\nIt didn’t matter to her whether research supported EMDR; what mattered was whether it worked for her. Each time a particularly painful memory resurfaced, Henn said, “you have to go through it again until it has no meaning.” By confronting the trauma head-on, she added, it became less powerful.\n\n“It’s integrating what’s stuck in time,” explained Kalin, the psychologist. Memories formed under the adrenaline of trauma are never put to rest, she said. “EMDR processing is untangling the knot.”\n\nOnce the memories are processed, therapists say, they are less vivid — less like the film reel Henn would see in her mind. Henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic.\n\nEMDR’s central appeal lies in the possibility of closure — an end to PTSD, and to therapy for it.\n\n“I’m going to come out equipped with tools to take care of myself,” Henn said. She already has put these tools to the test: Two months after she started EMDR, terrorists hit Paris, killing at least 130 people.\n\nSoon after that attack, she heard reports that a video, possibly from the Islamic State, contained a threat to hit Washington next, and she had a “full-fledged panic attack,” she said.\n\n“I was not sure where I was; I was sweating profusely but also really cold,” she said. She stepped onto the 11th-floor terrace at work and looked down.\n\n“The thought came into my head: ‘I just need to walk off, and that will wake me up,’ ” Henn remembered. “And I had enough awareness that I sat myself down and was trying to think of calming breaths and going back and forth” — actions reminiscent of EMDR processing.\n\n“It took a while, and it was a little terrifying that I had that thought,” she said. “But the process of being able to calm myself down was much better than anything I had been equipped with before.”\n\nIn a few weeks, Henn mentioned to Kalin, she would be marrying her college sweetheart. Beneath the excitement, she felt a twinge of panic: How would she react to her brother’s absence from the wedding? She asked a close friend to write a speech from Nate’s point of view, as if he were speaking at the celebration. But Henn admitted she was worried that the speech would trigger an extreme emotional reaction, a fear shared by many who suffer from PTSD. They never know when the trauma will reignite; it can spread from the smallest spark, even on the happiest day.\n\n“Does EMDR deal with the future?” she asked Kalin. Kalin nodded, and they began processing memories again.\n\nAmong the painful recollections, Henn encountered a happy memory — friends who arrived at the funeral to support the family — and a smile broke through the tears.\n\n“It felt like a gift from Nate,” she said.\n\nEMDR, Henn said, allowed her to have a do-over — to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief. She was finally able to remember the good times with her brother without being overwhelmed by pain.\n\n“I’m still sad, but I’m not hurt by it anymore,” she said. “It’s not opening up any fresh wounds.”\n\nAs Henn walked outside into a brisk April evening after her session, there was a new easiness to her, as though something had finally been freed.']","This story leans hard on a single patient’s story, and avoids discussion of what the evidence shows to support this treatment for PSTD.","
Reducing symptoms of PTSD can be challenging. This story reflects on the journey of a young woman who finds relief in a strategy called eye movement and desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR), which, according to the EMDR Institute, asks a client to reflect on “emotionally disturbing material in brief sequential doses while simultaneously focusing on an external stimulus”; in many cases, that external stimulus is some type of repetitive eye movement. Proponents of the therapy argue that it relieves emotional distress and reduces physiological reactions to traumatic memories.
The story does offer cautionary information from a psychologist who does not employ the strategy, and who questions the superiority of the technique over other established strategies. However, the overwhelming message of this vivid anecdotal account is that EMDR can help.
The story notes that the patient is indifferent to issues of evidence; “what mattered is whether it [EMDR] worked for her.” While that may be the case, urging readers to be similarly indifferent is a problem. The cautionary addition to the headline—“But does it work?—was a good signal but received too little attention in the text.

A biopsy involves the removal of tissue or fluids to test for disease.\n\n""Doing image-guided biopsy allows more definitive diagnosis and shorter hospital stays,"" said Dr. Robert Quencer, chair of radiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who was not involved on the study.\n\nIn addition, image-guided biopsies are more accurate, Quencer said. ""This is a trend throughout the whole country. I doubt there is any variation to this in any major medical center.""\n\nThe report is published online and in the September print edition of Radiology.\n\nFor the study, a team led by Dr. Sharon W. Kwan, a radiology resident at the University of California, San Francisco, looked at biopsies done among Medicare patients from 1997 through 2008.\n\nDuring that time, the number of biopsies increased from 1,380 per 100,000 in 1997 to 1,945 per 100,000 in 2008. That\'s an annual growth of 3 percent in number of biopsies, the researchers noted.\n\nMoreover, by 2008, 67 percent of these biopsies were being done through the skin with the help of CT scans, ultrasound and MRI, Kwan\'s group found.\n\n""We also found that the use of imaging guidance increased over this time period, most likely because the technique enables more efficient and safe targeting of lesions,"" Kwan said in a news release.\n\nThis increase in less-invasive biopsies went along with a decrease in the number of more-invasive biopsies and through-the-skin biopsies where no imaging was used, the researchers found.\n\nThe only two areas where needle biopsies were not the majority of biopsies done were biopsies of lymph nodes and soft tissues. For these areas, open biopsies are easier to do and need less imaging guidance, Kwan\'s team noted.\n\nQuencer thinks the use of image-guided biopsies will continue to increase over time, even for lymph nodes and soft tissues. ""In time, I would expect 80 to 90 percent of biopsies will be image-guided biopsies,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on biopsies, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","Numbers can be numbing and this story did that to our heads.  Lots of numbers about growth in the use of less-invasive biopsies, but no exploration of the data behind claims for more accuracy, more efficiency, shorter hospital stays.

With complicated grief, “something gets in the way of that adaptation,” she said. “Something impedes the course of healing.”\n\nHow common is this prolonged grief? An epidemiological study of more than 2,500 people, conducted in Germany in 2009, put the proportion at nearly 7 percent, and at 9 percent among those over age 61.\n\nGeorge A.

Yet, he notes, “we always see a group of people who don’t recover.”\n\nThe problem appears more likely when a death is sudden or violent; when the person who died was one’s spouse, romantic partner or child; and when the bereaved person has a history of depression, anxiety or substance abuse.\n\nDefining this sort of grief has engendered some professional disagreement. What criteria distinguish complicated grief from depression or anxiety? When does normal grief become prolonged?

Measuring immune markers just one hour after singing does not mean they will remain elevated long enough to make a material change in the person’s response to disease.

And the risk of severe ROP seemed to be reduced by 90 percent, the researchers added.\n\n""Human milk feeding potentially plays a strong role in protecting very preterm newborns from any-stage ROP and severe ROP,"" the international team of study authors wrote.\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity causes blood vessels to grow in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. When the vessels grow, they can cause the retina to detach, destroying vision, according to the U.S. National Eye Institute.\n\nFor the study, researchers from China, Canada and the United Kingdom reanalyzed the results of five published studies on ROP. The studies included more than 2,200 preterm infants, comparing how often babies had been fed human milk or formula, and whether or not they developed ROP.\n\nHowever, the new analysis only showed an association between breast milk and a reduced risk of ROP. It did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship due to the study\'s design.\n\nResults of the study were published online Nov. 16 in Pediatrics.\n\nExtremely preterm babies are most at risk of ROP. In the United States, 59 percent of babies born at 22 to 28 weeks have the disorder, said study researcher Dr. Chao Chen, a neonatologist at Children\'s Hospital of Fudan University, in Shanghai. He added that in China, a previous study showed the incidence of ROP was 50 percent in infants with a birth weight under 1,000 grams (2.2 pounds).\n\nROP ""has become a leading cause of childhood blindness in recent time,"" Chen said. ""In general, there are more ROP cases in developed countries, but more severe cases and higher rates of blindness in developing countries.""\n\nThe greater incidence of ROP is likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries, according to Chen. In developing countries, preterm babies are less likely to survive. When they do, the screening and treatments are not as good, Chen said, so blindness may be more likely.\n\nBabies in the studies had a range of gestational ages, from 26 to about 30 weeks. Their weights ranged from about 1.7 pounds to about 3 pounds. No information was given about how long the breast-feeding continued.\n\nIn re-evaluating the studies, Chen\'s team found that breast-feeding in any amount appeared to reduce the risk of ROP. And it appeared that the more breast milk, the better. Exclusive breast-feeding seemed to drop the odds of ROP by 75 percent compared to exclusive formula use. And any breast-feeding appeared to reduce the odds of the serious eye disease by 46 percent, the research showed.\n\nHow might human milk offer protection from the eye disorder? The antioxidants in human milk may help, Chen said. Human milk also has immune-protective properties, the researchers said. Breast-feeding also seems to help prevent two conditions known as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis that may require oxygen therapy, which has also been linked to a higher risk of ROP, the study authors said.\n\nDr. Adolfo Llanos, a neonatologist at Nicklaus Children\'s Hospital in Miami, who was not involved with the new study, said the ""quality of this analysis is very good. It\'s reassuring to see the benefit we see with breast milk.""\n\nHe said breast milk may help by reducing inflammation in the body. ""Preemies don\'t regulate inflammation in their bodies well,"" he said.\n\nLlanos cautioned that the study looked only at a mother\'s own breast milk, not donor milk, which can be used when the biological mother doesn\'t have enough of her own breast milk.\n\nThe takeaway from this study, Llanos said, is to breast-feed as long as possible, if possible.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about breast-feeding, visit American Academy of Pediatrics.']","This story is clear on the big picture, even if certain details of the coverage could have been presented a bit more sharply.","
This article consists overall of balanced reporting. There are a few missteps in presenting the quantitative evidence but some very strong points are present as well, including the acknowledgement that the studies under consideration are all observational in nature, and the corresponding reminder that “correlation does not imply causation.”

For multiple sclerosis, specifically, increasing cholesterol synthesis gene expression in astrocytes of the spinal cord can be a pathway to repair nerves that affect walking.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune, neurodegenerative disease, characterized by distinct disabilities affecting walking, vision, and cognition, to name a few. MS patients differ markedly from each other regarding which disability affects them the most. Inflammation strips the myelin coating from nerve cell extensions, called axons, and connections at the ends of nerves, called synapses, are lost, together disrupting signaling and eventually causing permanent disability depending on where this occurs. UCLA researchers proposed that molecular mechanisms behind each disability may differ, and that neuroprotective treatments tailored for each disability may be more effective than nonspecific treatments aiming to reduce a composite of different disabilities. The team focused on astrocytes, a type of brain cell that becomes activated in MS and plays several important roles in disease, examining gene expression in astrocytes in different regions.\n\nMETHOD\n\nWorking with a mouse model of MS, the research team assessed astrocytes in various regions of the brain and spinal cord known to be involved in walking, vision or cognition. They compared gene expression changes between regions that correspond to different disabilities. In the spinal cord - an area that\'s critical for walking -- they found a decrease in the expression of cholesterol synthesis genes. Cholesterol does not leave the blood and enter the brain, instead it is made in astrocytes and plays a role in making myelin, the nerve coating, and synapses, the nerve connections. They hypothesized that while inflammation causes loss of myelin and synapses, it is the decrease in cholesterol synthesis gene expression in astrocytes that explains why lesions do not repair in MS. They treated MS mice with a drug that increased expression in cholesterol synthesis genes - and this resulted in improved walking ability.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThis disability-specific discovery approach represents a strategy for finding neuroprotective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases that are tailored to repair damage for each disability, one at a time, in contrast to a ""one size fits all"" treatment approach.\n\nAUTHORS\n\nIn addition to senior author Dr. Rhonda Voskuhl, who directs UCLA\'s Multiple Sclerosis Program and holds the Jack H. Skirball Chair in Multiple Sclerosis Research, study co-first authors were Noriko Itoh, Yuichiro Itoh, and Alessia Tassoni, with other co-authors including Emily Ren, Max Kaito, Ai Ohno, Vista Farkhondeh, Hadley Johnsonbaugh, Yan Ao, Josh Burda and Michael Sofroniew, all of UCLA.\n\nJOURNAL\n\nThe study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n###\n\nFUNDING\n\nThe work was supported with funding from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the California Community Foundation, the Tom Sherak MS Hope Foundation, the Rhoda Goetz Foundation for Multiple Sclerosis, and other partners of the UCLA Multiple Sclerosis Program.']",This basic science study in mice has no application for human patients in the near future.,"A small UCLA study in an animal model of multiple sclerosis showed some improvement in the mice’s walking ability after the researchers gave them a drug that changed gene expression of  cells in the brain and spinal cord called astrocytes.
The study is interesting from a basic science perspective and from the perspective of a new idea for a therapy — improving cholesterol synthesis, which cells need to repair their membranes damaged by the disease. But there’s no immediate application for human patients.
The release would have been improved with some discussion of benefits, harms and how this study fits into the bigger picture of MS treatment. On the plus side, the release lists funding sources and gives us some idea of what is novel about the research.

Doctors hope a new, individualized immunotherapy treatment may now keep her in remission. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\n\nBy the time 8-year-old Ava Christianson got to the National Institutes of Health this summer, she had lost several grueling rounds to leukemia and was bracing for the next one.\n\nIntensive chemotherapy, which cures up to 90 percent of children with the most common type of leukemia, hadn’t kept her cancer from coming back. Neither had a painful bone-marrow transplant nor an experimental treatment. Her careworn father cried in the shower to hide his anguish. Her mother couldn’t help but wonder, “Why is this happening to our child?”\n\nBut Ava was fortunate in one respect. Discoveries in the burgeoning field of immunotherapy are offering lifelines to desperate patients who previously had none. “Five years ago,” said her mother, Bethany Christianson, “our doctor would have just had to tell us to go home.”\n\nInstead, in a five-minute procedure at the NIH Clinical Center in late July, the freckle-face girl got another chance to beat the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has stalked her since age 4. She was infused with 30 million of her own T cells, a key part of the immune system, that had been genetically modified to track down and kill her cancer like a pack of crazed dogs.\n\nAva’s treatment, called CAR T-cell therapy, is one of the new immunotherapies that attempt to rally the body’s own defenses to fight malignancies. Unlike other cancer advances, it is being tested widely in children because of its stunning effectiveness in ALL, the most common pediatric cancer. In early-stage trials, many patients who had repeatedly relapsed saw their leukemia disappear. Some remain cancer-free.\n\nYet big questions surround the therapy, and many scientists are urging caution. “There’s very real promise with this approach, but the immune system is complicated,” said Terry Fry, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) scientist who is running Ava’s trial. “There’s a lot that still needs to be worked out.”\n\n[Here’s what you need to know about immunotherapy]\n\nComplications can be lethal; one clinical trial was briefly halted in July after three young adults died of brain swelling. It is also far from clear that such a personalized approach — possibly costing hundreds of thousands of dollars — is economically viable on a large scale or will produce the lasting remissions that everyone hopes to see.\n\nU.S. researchers running CAR T-cell trials for children and adults with leukemia and lymphoma have reported remission rates up to 90 percent in some cases. That’s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. But rates in other trials are considerably lower, and many patients eventually relapse.\n\n“The treatment is great about getting people into remission but not at keeping everyone in remission,” said Rebecca Gardner, a pediatric oncologist at Seattle Children’s hospital. She ran an early-stage trial using CAR T-cell therapy in which 39 of 42 patients went into complete remission. By a year, about half had relapsed, either because their T cells had inexplicably disappeared or their cancer had changed so that the T cells could no longer recognize it. “Leukemia is really smart,” she said.\n\nAva’s family understands that better than most. She underwent her first CAR T-cell procedure in Minnesota last year, but her leukemia returned within six months. Her treatment at NIH involved a next-generation version, developed by NCI, that used a different target for her marauding T cells. In this first-in-humans trial, she is Patient No. 18.\n\nIn late August, the Christiansons learned that Ava had gone into remission. She and her mother, who were still at the Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., gleefully rushed home to Wisconsin so Ava could start third grade.\n\n\n\nAva, who is participating in a clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health, plays with her mother, Bethany Christianson, during a checkup visit in September. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nHer parents, so frequently disappointed, remain guardedly optimistic. “Hope is all you have,” said her father, Jay Christianson.\n\nHer mother added, “We just need this to work and to stay working.”\n\nNCI’s Fry is careful not to make any promises about an extended remission. “I can’t say that’s going to be the case,” he said, “because we just don’t know. It’s too soon.”\n\nScientists have wanted for decades to marshal the immune system to vanquish cancer, but their attempts have mostly been frustrated. In the past few years, however, breakthroughs have led to the development of two types of immunotherapy — checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T cells — that are generating enormous excitement.\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors are off-the-shelf therapies aimed at unleashing the immune system’s power to see and attack the disease. Used mostly in adults, to date, they are producing impressive results, albeit in a minority of cases. The most prominent: Jimmy Carter. The former president became the poster patient when he was successfully treated last year with a checkpoint inhibitor called Keytruda, along with surgery and radiation, for his advanced melanoma.\n\nMuch of the earliest research for customized CAR T-cell therapy was conducted at NCI, the University of Pennsylvania, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Seattle Children’s.\n\n“The technology of CAR T cells is really a breakthrough, especially for children,” said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children’s Research Institute.\n\nAlmost all the initial work focused on CD19, a protein found on the surface of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Scientists figured out ways to use a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, to reprogram T cells to recognize the protein and kill the cancer.\n\n[Immunotherapy is showing benefits in an increasing number of cancers]\n\nZane Esposito, a 13-year-old from Plano, Tex., calls himself the “T-Cell Explorer.” He was diagnosed with ALL in June 2010. “I just thought my back hurt,” he said. “I couldn’t walk up the steps very well.” Almost three years of treatment, including punishing chemotherapy, provided a couple of years of remission. His leukemia returned in January, and this time it did not respond to treatment.\n\nSoon after Zane relapsed, he and his father bumped into friends in a local doughnut shop who told them about a TV segment on CAR T-cell therapy. Paul Esposito searched online and found Gardner’s clinical trial in Seattle. Zane signed on, got the treatment, went back into full remission and gained 25 pounds.\n\nHis Texas doctors have talked about a bone-marrow transplant to increase the chance of a true cure, but the Espositos have resisted. The Seattle doctors say it is not clear yet whether that is necessary or whether there would be still other options should Zane’s cancer recur.\n\nZane is moving on, with dreams of competing on “Chopped Junior” to show off his homemade pasta and pizza. On July 27, the day that Ava got her T cells, he celebrated his 13th birthday.\n\nAva was 4 when she started having leg pains, then trouble standing up. Her mother suspected Lyme disease. “You never think of cancer with a child,” she said, eyes filling as she recalled her daughter’s cancer diagnosis in November 2012. The doctors assured the family that it was typical leukemia — and curable.\n\n\n\nAva receives T-cell therapy for leukemia from nurse Julie Thompson at the NIH Clinical Center, her mother nearby for support. (Bill O’Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nLike most children, Ava quickly went into remission after starting the prescribed 30 months of chemotherapy. But at home in Prescott, a small Wisconsin city at the confluence of the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers, things did not get easier for the Christiansons. In early 2013, Ava was hospitalized in Minneapolis for a lung infection. About the same time, the couple’s second daughter, Audrey, was born 13 weeks premature and hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit in St. Paul. Bethany, who manages occupational therapists for a nursing-home chain, and Jay, a rural mail carrier, shuttled between the Twin Cities visiting their daughters.\n\n“I would be with Ava during the day, and then when Jay got home, he would stay with Ava, and I would spend time with Audrey,” she said. “No matter what you do, you feel like a bad mom.”\n\nA year or so after treatment began, Ava relapsed. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. Her doctors arranged for a bone-marrow transplant, with her baby sister as the donor.\n\nThe transplant made her sick and the whole family miserable. Ava spent months in the hospital and then a year at home. Because of fears of infection, she couldn’t go out much. She missed all of first grade. But her parents had hope that the transplant would keep her cancer at bay.\n\n[Brain cancer now the leading cause of cancer deaths in children]\n\nAt a six-month checkup, tests showed that the leukemia was back again. There were no more conventional treatments to try. But because of her two relapses, Ava was now eligible for a CAR T-cell trial at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital. Her T cells would be genetically altered to go after CD19.The number of cells then would be vastly increased and reinfused.\n\nIt sounded like science fiction, but Bethany Christianson found comfort in talking to the father of Emily Whitehead. In 2012, the 6-year-old Pennsylvania girl became the first child to be treated with reprogrammed T cells for leukemia. She has been in remission ever since.\n\nAva got her treatment in April 2015 — after her cells were extracted via a tube inserted into her neck — and five days later had a massive immune reaction with a high fever and intense pain. While that is typical, some patients become dangerously ill. Yet Ava recovered fast, went into remission and attended summer school, where she learned how to make pigs-in-a-blanket and wrote her own cookbook.\n\nBy then, her parents had gotten used to living in the midst of remissions and relapses. “When she felt better, we would do everything we could,” Bethany said. They visited Robot World, a scientifically themed attraction a few hours from Prescott. “You don’t put things off, because you are always thinking, ‘What if?’ ”\n\nLast fall, doctors delivered the bad news. Ava’s cancer had changed. It was no longer producing the CD19 protein, which meant her modified T cells could no longer recognize the disease. But the leukemia was still producing another common protein, called CD22, and that offered an opportunity.\n\nAs it happened, Fry, head of the blood-cancer section in NCI’s pediatric oncology branch, had already launched the world’s first trial using CAR T-cell therapy to focus on CD22. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapy’s impact, researchers thought. At the time, they did not realize that a significant percentage of patients in the other trials might relapse because of changes in their cancer.\n\nFry insisted as he designed the study that children be included, despite ever-present concerns about exposing them to safety risks. He wanted to avoid a delay in testing what could be a lifesaving pediatric treatment. “I didn’t want to take two to three years on adults, and then go back and do children,” he said.\n\n[For a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on medicine’s hottest field]\n\nThe clinical trial already has treated nearly two dozen leukemia and lymphoma patients through age 30. The majority have gone into remission, although some have had their cancer return. While it is far too early to know long-term outcomes, Fry said he is convinced the CD22 treatment holds much potential. He is planning another trial next year with the Stanford University School of Medicine. It will target both proteins — CD19 and CD22 — simultaneously.\n\n\n\nWith her leukemia in remission following a promising immunotherapy procedure being tested at NIH, Ava was able to start third grade with her friends. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nOnce Ava relapsed after the Minnesota trial, Fry’s study at the NIH Clinical Center appeared to be the only option. But there was no slot immediately available. With Ava deteriorating, doctors put her on an experimental treatment that sent her into remission but had serious side effects.\n\nThey immediately stopped the medication when they learned Ava might get her T-cell therapy in January — she actually needed a high level of leukemia in her body to participate. But on this wrenching roller coaster of research and treatment, it turned out that she still had to wait several more months.\n\nAva’s cancer returned in June. Her T cells were extracted in preparation for the trial, even as she got sicker and sicker.\n\nShe was admitted to the Clinical Center in mid-July, to a room with dancing penguins painted on the windows. The day before her therapy, an ebullient Audrey burst into the room and the two sisters ran down the hall to a play space.\n\nHer mother was ready this time for the intense immune reaction that followed treatment, although she still found it hard to watch Ava spike a fever of 106. “When you see that temperature on the thermometer, every bone in your body says it’s wrong to let it get that high,” Bethany said. “Then suddenly it’s over.”\n\nIf his daughter’s cancer returns yet again, “I have no idea what we’ll do,” Jay said. “We’re kind of up against the edge.”\n\nFry thinks she might be able to undergo a second round of her latest immunotherapy, as long as her cancer is still producing CD22 proteins. Doctors in Minnesota also might recommend a second bone-marrow transplant — something her parents dread, saying it was the roughest treatment of all.\n\nFor now, Ava is happily back in school. “I just want her to be a kid,” Bethany Christianson said. “She has missed out on a lot of that.”']","Readers get the full sense of how experimental this treatment is, and how it’s a last-resort option.","The story focuses on on the use of an experimental immunotherapy technique called CAR T-cell therapy to treat children who have been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and who are no longer responding to conventional cancer treatments.
The story does a good job of stressing that, while CAR T-cell therapy may be promising, it is far too early to determine how effective the treatment will be at keeping cancer from recurring. Important harms are made clear. Readers get the full sense of how experimental this treatment is, and how it’s a last-resort option. We do wish the story had provided more specifics on the clinical trial findings, though.

Since the surgery is tricky and time-consuming, fewer than 10% of hair-restoration surgeons do it. Most simply remove a whole strip of scalp and separate out the follicles under a microscope. Strip surgery is painful and takes weeks or months to heal versus just a couple of days’ healing time and less scarring with individual follicular-unit extraction, Harris says.\n\nThe new ARTAS robot decides which follicles to collect and plucks them out as the doctor stands by to check its work. The surgeon can watch from the same room or via a remote monitor.\n\nHarris says the time passes quickly as he watches the robot do its thing: “It’s certainly less tedious than doing it by hand. It allows me to think more about the other things I’m going to do with the patient.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe robot halves the surgery time, Harris says, and surgeons can be trained in its use in a couple of days, rather than the two to three years it took him to perfect the by-hand operation.\n\nHarris developed a blade for the drill tip that the machine uses to punch out follicles without damaging them and licensed it to Restoration Robotics Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., the company that makes ARTAS.

He and his fellow testers have already put more than 350 heads under the machine’s care, with no complications, he says.\n\nSince collecting follicles one by one directly from the scalp is so time-consuming and difficult, physicians that do it charge $5,000 to $10,000, Harris says.

Disagreement Abounds.","[""The investigators found that the less salt people ate, the more likely they were to die of heart disease — 50 people in the lowest third of salt consumption (2.5 grams of sodium per day) died during the study as compared with 24 in the medium group (3.9 grams of sodium per day) and 10 in the highest salt consumption group (6.0 grams of sodium per day). And while those eating the most salt had, on average, a slight increase in systolic blood pressure — a 1.71-millimeter increase in pressure for each 2.5-gram increase in sodium per day — they were no more likely to develop hypertension.\n\n“If the goal is to prevent hypertension” with lower sodium consumption, said the lead author, Dr. Jan A. Staessen, a professor of medicine at the University of Leuven, in Belgium, “this study shows it does not work.”\n\nBut among the study’s other problems, Dr. Briss said, its subjects who seemed to consume the smallest amount of sodium also provided less urine than those consuming more, an indication that they might not have collected all of their urine in an 24-hour period.\n\nDr. Frank Sacks of the Harvard School of Public Health agreed and also said the study was flawed.\n\n“It’s a problematic study,” Dr. Sacks said. “We shouldn’t be guiding any kind of public health decisions on it.”\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Michael Alderman, a blood pressure researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and editor of the American Journal of Hypertension, said medical literature on salt and health effects was inconsistent. But, Dr. Alderman said, the new study is not the only one to find adverse effects of low-sodium diets. His own study, with people who had high blood pressure, found that those who ate the least salt were most likely to die.\n\nDr. Alderman said that he once was an unpaid consultant for the Salt Institute but that he now did no consulting for it or for the food industry and did not receive any support or take any money from industry groups.\n\nLowering salt consumption, Dr. Alderman said, has consequences beyond blood pressure.

But if they can’t get people on a low-salt diet for a clinical trial, what are they talking about?”\n\nHe added: “It will cost money, but that’s why we do science.

It also has been suggested as a possible reason that senior citizens in India, where curcumin is a dietary staple, have a lower prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and better cognitive performance.\n\n“Exactly how curcumin exerts its effects is not certain, but it may be due to its ability to reduce brain inﬂammation, which has been linked to both Alzheimer’s disease and major depression,” said Dr. Gary Small, director of geriatric psychiatry at UCLA’s Longevity Center and of the geriatric psychiatry division at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA, and the study’s first author.\n\nThe double-blind, placebo-controlled study involved 40 adults between the ages of 50 and 90 years who had mild memory complaints. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or 90 milligrams of curcumin twice daily for 18 months.\n\nAll 40 subjects received standardized cognitive assessments at the start of the study and at six-month intervals, and monitoring of curcumin levels in their blood at the start of the study and after 18 months. Thirty of the volunteers underwent positron emission tomography, or PET scans, to determine the levels of amyloid and tau in their brains at the start of the study and after 18 months.\n\nThe people who took curcumin experienced significant improvements in their memory and attention abilities, while the subjects who received placebo did not, Small said. In memory tests, the people taking curcumin improved by 28 percent over the 18 months. Those taking curcumin also had mild improvements in mood, and their brain PET scans showed significantly less amyloid and tau signals in the amygdala and hypothalamus than those who took placebos.\n\nThe amygdala and hypothalamus are regions of the brain that control several memory and emotional functions.\n\nFour people taking curcumin, and two taking placebos, experienced mild side effects such as abdominal pain and nausea.\n\nThe researchers plan to conduct a follow-up study with a larger number of people. That study will include some people with mild depression so the scientists can explore whether curcumin also has antidepressant effects. The larger sample also would allow them to analyze whether curcumin’s memory-enhancing effects vary according to people’s genetic risk for Alzheimer’s, their age or the extent of their cognitive problems.\n\n“These results suggest that taking this relatively safe form of curcumin could provide meaningful cognitive benefits over the years,” said Small, UCLA’s Parlow–Solomon Professor on Aging.\n\nThe paper’s authors, in addition to Small, are Prabha Siddarth, Dr. Zhaoping Li, Karen Miller, Linda Ercoli, Natacha Emerson, Jacqueline Martinez, Koon-Pong Wong, Jie Liu, Dr. David Merrill, Dr. Stephen Chen, Susanne Henning, Nagichettiar Satyamurthy, Sung-Cheng Huang, Dr. David Heber and Jorge Barrio, all of UCLA.\n\nThe study was supported by the Ahmanson Foundation, the Marshall and Margherite McComb Foundation, the McMahan Foundation, Bob and Marion Wilson, the Fran and Ray Stark Foundation Fund for Alzheimer’s Disease Research, the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nTheravalues Corp. provided the curcumin and placebos for the trial, as well as funds for laboratory testing and for Small’s travel to present preliminary findings at the 2017 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.\n\nSEE ORIGINAL STUDY']",The study involved only 40 volunteers taking a special supplement but the release advises readers to consume more Indian food for improved memory and mood.,"This news release summarizes an 18-month study of 40 healthy adults to determine whether oral curcumin — the active substance in the spice turmeric — has cognitive benefits. While it does provide some details on the study design and results, it is incomplete in several important areas. For example, is a 28% improvement in cognitive test results clinically important or simply statistically significant? This should have been explained.
The release did not speak to the costs of the supplement used although it appears to be commercially available. Furthermore, there are harms and conflicts of interest that should have been explored further.

A comprehensive review published in the Endocrine Society\'s Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism focuses on current and future approaches to management of menopausal symptoms after breast cancer.\n\nMenopause is a normal part of a woman\'s aging process but pre-menopausal women treated with chemotherapy can also develop premature menopause, and consequently, severe menopausal symptoms including sleep disorders, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), vasomotor symptoms (VMS), mood changes, depressive symptoms, cardiovascular disease, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. Hormone therapy may help relieve a woman\'s menopausal symptoms but is not recommended for women who have had breast cancer.\n\n""Following breast cancer, women should generally not be treated with menopausal hormone therapy but should instead focus on lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation, weight loss, and regular physical activity,"" said the study\'s first author, Richard J. Santen, M.D., of the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville, Va. ""Pharmacologic agents are also available to treat women with severe symptoms. The most important thing to remember is that therapy must be individualized based on each woman\'s needs and goals.""\n\nSanten and colleagues reviewed controlled clinical trials, observational studies, evidence-based guidelines, and expert opinion from professional societies to address the gap in treatment recommendations for management of menopausal symptoms after breast cancer.\n\nThe review\'s recommendations include:\n\nSmoking cessation, weight loss (if indicated), limiting or avoiding alcohol, maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D and calcium, eating a healthy diet, and regular physical activity are suggested for all women with prior breast cancer\n\nNon-pharmacologic therapies for VMS such as cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, and acupuncture may be helpful as are vaginal lubricants and moisturizers\n\nSeveral emerging approaches such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), Tissue selective estrogen complex (TSECs), estetrol, and neurokinin B inhibitors show promise as useful agents to expand options for symptom relief with less breast cancer risk but have not yet been tested to confirm safety in women with prior breast cancer\n\n###\n\nOther authors of the study include: Cynthia A. Stuenkel of the University of California, San Diego in La Jolla, Calif.; Susan R. Davis of the School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine, Monash University in Australia; JoAnn V. Pinkerton of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Va.; Ann Gompel of Paris Descartes University in France; and Mary Ann Lumsden of the University of Glasgow School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Nursing in Scotland.\n\nThe study, ""Managing Menopausal Symptoms and Associated Clinical Issues in Breast Cancer Survivors"" is published online at https:/ / academic. oup. com/ jcem/ article/ 4058051/ Managing-menopausal-symptoms-and-associated , ahead of print.\n\nEndocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers. The Endocrine Society is the world\'s oldest and largest organization of scientists devoted to hormone research and physicians who care for people with hormone-related conditions.']",The release doesn’t give us any clues about the studies consulted or their findings.,"This news release lists several non-pharmalogical steps for relieving menopausal symptoms of women who have been treated for breast cancer. The main takeaway is that most women who have been treated for breast cancer shouldn’t receive hormone therapy, but instead focus on lifestyle changes although some emerging pharmacologic approaches were listed as well.
It’s not clear from either the news release or the published study how researchers drew their conclusions. The release states that clinical trials, observational studies, guidelines, and expert opinion were analyzed, but no study data is provided to put the findings in perspective.

No new safety issues were observed.\n\nThe EBBINGHAUS cognitive function trial conducted in FOURIER patients also achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating that Repatha was non-inferior to placebo for the effect on cognitive function.\n\nDetailed results from the Repatha FOURIER outcomes trial will be presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 66th Annual Scientific Session Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session in Washington, D.C. on Friday, March 17 at 8 a.m. ET. Detailed results from the Repatha EBBINGHAUS cognitive function trial will be presented at the Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session on Saturday, March 18 at 8 a.m. ET.\n\n""In the GLAGOV study, we demonstrated that Repatha has an effect on atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. These FOURIER results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,"" said Sean E. Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Cardiovascular disease remains the number one health burden in the world, and we look forward to sharing these outcomes data with the scientific community at the ACC 66th Annual Scientific Session.""\n\nFOURIER ( F urther Cardiovascular OU tcomes R esearch with PCSK9 I nhibition in Subjects with E levated R isk) is a multinational Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in approximately 27,500 patients who had either an MI, an ischemic stroke or symptomatic peripheral artery disease and an LDL ≥70 mg/dL or a non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL on optimized statin therapy. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. Patients were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly. The study continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary MACE (major adverse cardiac event) endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke, whichever occured first.\n\nEBBINGHAUS ( E valuating PCSK9 B inding anti B ody I nfluence o N co G nitive H e A lth in high cardiovasc U lar risk S ubjects) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial involving approximately 1,900 patients enrolled in the FOURIER outcomes study. Executive function (Spatial Working Memory strategy index – primary endpoint) and secondary endpoints of working memory, memory function, and psychomotor speed were assessed using a tablet-based tool (CANTAB) at baseline and select time points.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.1 In the U.S., there are approximately 11 million people with ASCVD and/or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who have uncontrolled levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) over 70 mg/dL, despite treatment with statins or other cholesterol-lowering therapies.2,3 More than 60 percent of high-risk patients in Europe are still unable to adequately lower their LDL-C levels with statins or other currently approved lipid-lowering agents.4 Among very high-risk patients, the percentage is increased to more than 80 percent.4 It is estimated that less than one percent of people with FH (heterozygous and homozygous forms) in most countries are diagnosed.5\n\nFOURIER Study Design\n\nFOURIER, a multinational Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, is designed to evaluate whether treatment with Repatha in combination with statin therapy compared to placebo plus statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events. The primary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke.\n\nEligible patients with high cholesterol (LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] ≥100 mg/dL) and clinically evident ASCVD at more than 1,300 study locations around the world were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly plus effective statin dose; or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly plus effective statin dose. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. The study was event driven and continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary endpoint.\n\nEBBINGHAUS Study Design\n\nEBBINGHAUS ( E valuating PCSK9 B inding anti B ody I nfluence o N co G nitive H e A lth in high cardiovasc U lar risk S ubjects) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial involving approximately 1,900 patients enrolled in the FOURIER outcomes study. The primary endpoint in the study is the Spatial Working Memory strategy index of executive function. Secondary endpoints are working memory, as assessed by the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory (SWM) test between-errors score; memory function, as assessed by the CANTAB Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test; and psychomotor speed, as assessed by the CANTAB Reaction Time (RTI) test.\n\nAbout Repatha® (evolocumab)\n\nRepatha® (evolocumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.6\n\nRepatha is approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.\n\nImportant U.S. Product Information\n\nRepatha® is indicated as an adjunct to diet and:\n\nMaximally tolerated statin therapy for treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)\n\nOther LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C\n\nThe effect of Repatha® on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of Repatha® have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of Repatha® have not been established in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH.\n\nImportant U.S. Safety Information\n\nContraindication: Repatha® is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Repatha®.\n\nAllergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with Repatha®, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Repatha®, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.\n\nAdverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions (>5% of Repatha®-treated patients and more common than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, back pain, and injection site reactions.\n\nIn a 52-week trial, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.2% of Repatha®-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction that led to Repatha® treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo was myalgia (0.3% versus 0% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively).\n\nAdverse reactions from a pool of the 52-week trial and seven 12-week trials:\n\nLocal injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of Repatha® -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions in Repatha® -treated patients and placebo-treated patients were 0.1% and 0%, respectively.\n\nAllergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of Repatha® -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%).\n\nNeurocognitive events were reported in less than or equal to 0.2% in Repatha®-treated and placebo-treated patients.\n\nIn a pool of placebo- and active-controlled trials, as well as open-label extension studies that followed them, a total of 1,988 patients treated with Repatha® had at least one LDL-C value <25 mg/dL. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and Repatha® dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis. Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of LDL-C induced by Repatha® are unknown.\n\nMusculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 14.3% of Repatha® -treated patients and 12.8% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than placebo were back pain (3.2% versus 2.9% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively), arthralgia (2.3% versus 2.2%), and myalgia (2.0% versus 1.8%).\n\nHomozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): In 49 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia studied in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 33 patients received 420 mg of\n\nRepatha® subcutaneously once monthly. The adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 (6.1%) Repatha®-treated patients and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, included upper respiratory tract infection (9.1% versus 6.3%), influenza (9.1% versus 0%), gastroenteritis (6.1% versus 0%), and nasopharyngitis (6.1% versus 0%).\n\nImmunogenicity: Repatha® is a human monoclonal antibody. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Repatha®.\n\nPlease contact Amgen Medinfo at 800-77-AMGEN (800-772-6436) or 844-REPATHA (844-737-2842) regarding Repatha® availability or find more information, including full Prescribing Information, at www.amgen.com and www.Repatha.com.\n\nAbout Amgen Cardiovascular\n\nBuilding on more than three decades of experience in developing biotechnology medicines for patients with serious illnesses, Amgen is dedicated to addressing important scientific questions to advance care and improve the lives of patients with cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 Amgen\'s research into cardiovascular disease, and potential treatment options, is part of a growing competency at Amgen that utilizes human genetics to identify and validate certain drug targets.

I met him recently at the musicians\' union hall in downtown San Francisco.\n\nBut hitting those notes night after night in a cramped orchestra pit takes a toll on the musicians.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Josephine Gray Josephine Gray\n\n""The fact of having your arms up and carrying the weight of this instrument and pushing the instrument toward you and so you have this stress, this wall you\'re pushing against,"" says Rodriguez. ""And a well designed instrument will push back.""\n\nHe\'s been a working trumpet player for four decades, and all that back-arching and shoulder-pinching has left him with chronic pain in his lower back. Research suggests an alternative therapy called Alexander Technique may be an effective way to treat back pain.\n\nRodriguez first tried massage, chiropractic, and powerful pain killers. But finding a remedy for back pain can be a lot like a guessing game.\n\nHe says it was only through Alexander Technique lessons that he trained his body to move in a way that eased his aching back. Alexander Technique is a series of posture lessons, devised by a 19th century Australian actor named F.M. Alexander who had troubles with chronic laryngitis whenever he performed.\n\n""It\'s a feeling of working with yourself from the inside out,"" says Rodriguez. ""If you know you\'re twisting a certain way and using too much force, it\'s easy enough to know, Let that go.""\n\nIn particular, Joe now holds himself differently during his solos because of Alexander Technique.\n\n""I know that I can just sort of be on my sits bones, instead of a funny arch with my stomach pushed out or my back arched in some strange way,"" says Rodriguez\n\nJosephine Gray is Rodriguez\'s teacher and is a certified instructor in Alexander Technique. When I visited her, I was on my hands and knees next to her trying to re-learn how to stand up.\n\n""Let the neck be free, the head go forward and up,"" Gray tells me.\n\nOnce I make it to my feet, feeling somewhat like a newborn giraffe, there\'s a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay out of the studio window.\n\nGray teaches the technique and says low back pain is a common complaint of clients.\n\nA summary of the results of a major back pain study published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. The study showed that the Alexander Technique was highly effective in treating back pain. British Medical Journal YouTube\n\n""We look at what you are doing that causes that problem in the first place, so how you sit at the computer or how you pick up your child or what you do when you\'re driving,"" says Gray. ""I look at ways of changing your postural habits so you don\'t get into pain.""\n\nThese aren\'t static postures, though. Those who promote the technique say its more about how you move, and training yourself to release tension.\n\nThese are subtle – tiny, almost imperceptible shifts. And although the teacher will put her hand on your neck or shoulder, it\'s more to bring awareness than to make adjustments.\n\n""The whole point is that you understand the process so that you can arrive there yourself,"" says Gray.\n\nGray and Rodriguez, the trumpet player, both say the lessons are no cure all. But there is evidence it can ease chronic low back pain over the long run.\n\nPaul Little is a primary care researcher at the University of Southampton in Britain. He led a study of some 460 patients who were given Alexander lessons, massage, or the usual care of pain killers and exercise.\n\nAfter a year, those who had massage were no better off. Those who had six Alexander lessons showed some improvement. And those who went the distance got the best results.\n\n""The people who had 24 lessons had gone down from about 21 days of pain that the usual care group reported to about 3 days in pain,"" says Little. ""So a really dramatic difference there is reported days in pain.""\n\nLittle\'s research was published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. But now he wants to figure out why it appears to work.\n\nHe\'s about to start a new study that involves giving chronic back pain sufferers lessons in the Alexander Technique and exercises, and then measuring how far their spines can twist and the size and strength of their deep lumbar muscles – which Little thinks might work poorly in people with chronic low back pain.\n\nHe cautions though that it may be something else entirely that accounts for the apparent success of the Alexander Technique. If that\'s the case, Little says he\'ll have to go back to the drawing board.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">From a story-telling perspective, this was well-crafted.  But it fell short in evaluating the evidence, which is, in the words of our reviewers (a journalist and an MD who know the back pain literature), “thin…<span style=""font-family: Arial;"">with some distinct methodological limitations.”</span></span>","A feature on the National Public Radio (NPR) website proclaimed an alternative therapy known as “The Alexander Technique” to be “highly effective” in the treatment of chronic back pain.

Does the Alexander Technique—which educates patients on posture, movement and neuromuscular coordination—find strong support in multiple clinical trials? Is the therapy more effective than common evidence-based treatments for chronic back pain? Is it cost-effective? Unfortunately, the NPR story never provided answers to any of these questions. 
Instead, it examined the value of this therapy through the prism of two individuals heavily invested in its success: (1) a jazz trumpeter attempting to use the Alexander Technique to work through his chronic back symptoms; and (2) a therapist who makes a living teaching these methods. 
The article included brief comments from the British researcher who led a clinical trial showing the Alexander Technique to be superior to six sessions of massage and an uNPRoven exercise program. But the journalist highlighted only the most positive results from this study, and none of its potential limitations—of which there are several. (See BackLetter, 2008). And the writer didn’t seek out dispassionate commentary from any independent experts, much to the article’s detriment. 
So what might those experts have said about the Alexander Technique? They might have pointed out that the Alexander approach to chronic low back pain has been examined in only a single randomized clinical trial.  To be persuasive, these results would need to be confirmed in other clinical settings. Though they are promising and warrant further investigation, it isn’t clear if these findings represent a breakthrough, a further option for individuals with low back pain, or a false hope. 
At present there is no evidence that the Alexander Technique is more effective than other common evidence-based treatments for chronic low back pain—from manual therapies to structured exercise programs to multidisciplinary rehabilitation.  A recent systematic review performed for the British National Health Service concluded that all of these may be viable options for chronic back pain—but that none stood out as superior. (See NICE, 2009). So calling the Alexander Technique “highly effective” may be a bit of a reach.
In addition, the cost-effectiveness of this approach remains very much up in the air. In the clinical trial cited above, the Alexander Technique (which involved either six or 24 visits with a therapist) proved less cost-effective than a simple exercise program. (See NICE, 2009)
So should individuals with chronic or recurrent back pain consider the Alexander Technique as a treatment option? That would be a reasonable response. However, they should opt for this treatment approach only after taking a balanced look at both its potential strengths and its weaknesses—a process this article didn’t facilitate.

Equally problematic are the decisions to stop play or activities, or when patients who have suffered a concussion can safely return to normal activities without risking further injury.\n\nIn the new study, researchers have demonstrated that a blood test can now accurately diagnose a concussion using a form of blood profiling known as metabolomics. Dr. Douglas Fraser, a physician in the Paediatric Critical Care Unit at Children\'s Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre and Lawson scientist, led the study with his co-investigator Mark Daley, a professor in the Departments of Computer Science, Biology and Statistics & Actuarial Sciences at Western University.\n\nIn the relatively inexpensive test, blood is drawn from an individual that may have suffered a concussion as the result of a sudden blow to the head (or from transmitted forces from a sudden blow to the body) within 72 hours of the incident. The scientists measure a panel of metabolites - small molecules that are the products of the body\'s metabolism - in the blood to search for distinct patterns that indicate a concussion has occurred.\n\n""This novel approach, to use blood testing of metabolites as a diagnostic tool for concussions, was exploratory and we were extremely pleased with the robustness of our initial results,"" says Dr. Fraser, also an Associate Professor in Western\'s Departments of Paediatrics, Physiology & Pharmacology and Clinical Neurological Sciences at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry. ""We looked at a host of patterns and it appears that those who suffered a concussion have a very different pattern than those who have not had a concussion.""\n\nThis new method, fully funded by the Children\'s Health Foundation and conducted by the Western Concussion Study Group, is unique in that previous attempts have looked unsuccessfully for a single highly accurate protein biomarker that can distinguish concussed from non-concussed adolescent patients.\n\nIn this latest successful attempt, the researchers took a different approach and investigated a full spectrum of 174 metabolites.\n\n""We looked at all of these metabolites in concussed male adolescent patients and in non-concussed male adolescent patients and it turns out that the spectrum is really different,"" explains Daley, who is also Western\'s Associate Vice-President (Research) and a principal investigator at Western\'s renowned Brain & Mind Institute. ""There is no one metabolite that we can put a finger on but when we looked at all of them, those profiles are different enough that we could easily distinguish concussed patients from non-concussed. In fact, with fine tuning we can now look at sets of as few as 20-40 specific metabolites and maintain the diagnostic accuracy level of the test over 90 per cent.""\n\nConcussion is a major public health concern, often resulting in significant acute symptoms and in some individuals, long-term neurological dysfunction.\n\n""The discovery of a blood test that can aid in concussion diagnosis is very important,"" says Dr. Fraser. ""With further research, we anticipate that our blood test will also aid clinicians in predicting concussion outcome, as well as aid rehabilitation after concussion.""\n\nThe findings were recently published in the international journal Metabolomics.\n\nThe technology is subject to a patent application filed through WORLDiscoveries®, the joint technology transfer office of Lawson and Western.\n\n""This relatively quick and inexpensive blood test for concussion is by far the most accurate reported with tremendous potential for clinical management and commercialization,"" says Kirk Brown, Manager of Business Development for Lawson.\n\n###\n\nMEDIA CONTACT: Jeff Renaud, Senior Media Relations Officer, 519-661-2111, ext. 85165, jrenaud9@uwo.ca, @jeffrenaud99\n\nRobert DeLaet, Communications Associate, Lawson Health Research Institute, 519-685-8500, ext. 75664, robert.delaet@lawsonresearch.com\n\nABOUT WESTERN\n\nWestern delivers an academic experience second to none.

The researchers performed a retrospective analysis on blood samples taken from 29 male hockey players who had earlier been diagnosed with or without a concussion at a sports clinic. The authors examined a large number of potential chemicals that could identify patients with a concussion and appear to have identified around 17 that best predicted a concussion in this small population. However hopeful these results may be, there are some important caveats that weren’t highlighted in the news release. One was simply acknowledging the small number of athletes, all were male and participated in one sport, hockey. Whether these results may be generalizable remains to be determined. Second, the results were based upon retrospective analyses. The usefulness of such a test is when applied prospectively — or in real time. Whether the results will be the same when used prospectively is unknown. Finally, and maybe most important, how would these results be used to improve care? And do these results provide additional information beyond current practice or other tests that lead to better identification, classification and ultimately treatment. For all these reasons, the results from this small, preliminary study should be viewed cautiously and not as a clear “game changer.”
We have reviewed several stories and news releases about simple blood tests for concussion and remain wary when we see the term “game changing.” (See our tips on writing about concussion research.)

But cost, time, stigma, distance to travel, language barriers and other factors prevent many from seeking help.\n\nNow, a growing group of health-care providers are betting that technology—from web-based courses to mobile apps that send prompts via text—can help bridge that gap.\n\nIt might seem surprising, since therapy, more than many other kinds of medicine, is so focused on the relationship between patient and therapist. But research, including a meta-analysis of studies involving internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, suggests that digital therapies augmented by coaches who are available by text or phone can be as effective as evidence-based traditional therapy in treating some people with depression.\n\nOne study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and involving 99 patients with moderate depression, found that 90 of them completed a full eight-week course that included access to a suite of treatment apps and text support from coaches with at least a bachelor’s degree in psychology. On average, those who completed the course experienced a significant decrease in symptoms of depression, with three-fourths meeting the criteria for full remission. On average, participants used the apps more than 195 times over two months and interacted with a coach about twice a week.\n\nElsewhere, a study by the U.K. National Health Service, based on 1.2 million referrals for depression and anxiety, showed that computerized CBT administered to people with depression yielded a recovery rate of 58.4%, compared with 53.9% for those undergoing several types of in-person therapy. Ricardo F. Muñoz, a professor and founder of the Institute for International Internet Interventions for Health at Palo Alto University, who wasn’t involved in the research, says that while patients with more severe depression may be more likely to seek in-person therapy, “the fact that much mild or clinical depression can be successfully treated with computerized CBT is of note.”\n\nClinical psychologists put the first digital interventions for depression online about 15 years ago, according to Stephen Schueller, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University and a member of Northwestern’s Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies. “We basically thought, if it works in a self-help book, it will work online,” he says. But what they found was that it was difficult to motivate patients with depression to engage regularly with what were essentially online PowerPoint presentations.\n\nOver the past five years, online therapies have evolved to include mobile apps such as Joyable, Lantern and Ginger.io, which are more personalized and responsive. They typically ask users to enter information about their moods and behaviors, then offer problem-solving suggestions, prompts to help patients retrain responses to negative situations, and daily health tips.\n\nDr. Schueller believes digital interventions need to continue evolving with technology to remain effective. “The future is trying to better understand how to make these apps and sites engaging,” he says. “That will include clinical psychologists working with experts in augmented reality, virtual reality and gaming to develop mobile solutions that are truly novel.”\n\nOne such tool might look like Koko, an online messaging chatbot that uses the internet community to address emotional distress. With Koko, a user puts in a negative thought, like ‘I’m stupid,’ and sends it out to other people who may be working through similar situations, Dr. Schueller says. “The crowd creates responses, which go through the system and come back to you as a new message: ‘Maybe you didn’t fail because you’re stupid, but maybe because you didn’t sleep enough or you didn’t study enough.’ ”\n\nThe idea is that the crowd “can provide many different ideas that, when combined, might produce better or more creative solutions” than a therapist can, says Dr. Schueller, adding that Koko also uses machine learning to identify those in need of more direct intervention or support.\n\nLynn Bufka, associate executive director of practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association, says research has demonstrated that individuals can benefit from a range of technology-enabled services. As such, she would like to see a more “stepped” approach to mental-health care for individual patients.\n\nJessica Caldwell uses the mobile therapy platform Talkspace to text and video chat with her (licensed) therapist. We sat in on one of their sessions to see how technology is transforming the practice. Photo/Video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal.\n\nStepped care might start with a brief in-person assessment of a patient who shows signs of depression, so that therapists can identify any behavioral or health concerns, says Dr. Bufka, who believes that a human should always be involved at the beginning of a treatment process. “Then, depending on severity, we would provide each patient with a self-help book or access to web-based education. If that didn’t work, perhaps we’d move to a computer-assisted intervention, and then move toward in-person treatment,” either group or individual sessions, Dr. Bufka says. The stepped-care system exists in the U.K., she says, where providers in the National Health Service identify patients with moderate depression and other problems and offer self-help or technology-enabled services. “I think we’ll ultimately see a combination of different online interventions” for depression, she says.\n\nDr. Muñoz of Palo Alto University says he also believes that therapeutic and preventive services for depression could fall on a continuum.\n\nThe challenge for the public is knowing which digital tools to trust, he says, pointing to PsyberGuide, a website headed by Dr. Schueller that uses a standardized rating system to help consumers select products and apps for various mental-health conditions, as a good model.\n\nEventually, Dr. Muñoz envisions something he calls massive open online interventions, where therapeutic and preventive services could be delivered virtually to anyone in the world, in any language, at any time—ideally at no charge to users. The only barrier to entry would be internet access. Once the technology is built and more people use it, he says, the marginal cost of providing that intervention to one more person would gradually approach zero.\n\nHe points to a study he conducted in which 15,170 smokers from around the world participated in a free online smoking-cessation program offered in English and Spanish. After 12 months, 3,479 users, or 23%, reported they had quit smoking; to help that many people quit using more common care, he says, health providers would have had to give nicotine patches to 17,395 smokers, at a cost of $3.65 million.\n\nHis program, which had been built with earlier research grants, cost a total of $200,000 to maintain and advertise the website world-wide for 30 months.\n\n“With the political will and across-the-board standards, we can give an intervention to anyone, even people who don’t have access to a mental-health clinic or antidepressants,” he says. “All they need is access to a smartphone with a data plan.”\n\nMs. Mitchell is a writer in Chicago.

Eighty percent of men in the group had PSA levels below that threshold.\n\nIn this group of men, the higher the PSA level at baseline, the more likely the person was to develop prostate cancer and to die of the disease. Only 1.8 percent of men with PSA scores below 1.0 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, with only 0.04 percent dying of the disease. This compares with 15.7 percent of those with scores from 2 percent to 2.9 percent developing a malignancy and 0.36 percent dying of the disease.\n\n""This gives us some confidence that annual PSA screening is going to soon become a thing of the past,"" said Dr. Nicholas J. Vogelzang, chair of the Developmental Therapeutics Committee of US Oncology, who moderated the teleconference. ""A low PSA, particularly those in men who have less than 1.0, and probably those less than 2.0, certainly could be considered for substantially longer intervals of PSA screening... Personalization of PSA screening is clearly underway.""\n\nA second study also being presented at the symposium found that a drug already used to treat enlarged prostate gland may delay the progression of low-risk, early prostate cancer among men who choose a wait-and-see approach to treatment.\n\nIn comparison to men with low-risk, early-stage prostate cancer who took a placebo, ""men randomized to receive Avodart saw their chance of progression significantly reduced, by approximately 40 percent,"" said study author Dr. Neil Fleshner, head of urology at the University Health Network and Love Chair in Prostate Cancer Prevention at Princess Margaret Hospital, both in Toronto. ""Men with low-risk prostate cancer who want to have a period of observation should consider using this drug.""\n\nBut the maker of Avodart (dutasteride), GlaxoSmithKline, is unlikely to apply for new approval to market the drug for what is essentially prevention, meaning it would be used off-label in this context, he added.\n\nA final study of almost 4,000 patients found that surgeons needed to perform 1,600 procedures known as robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALP) to become adept at the procedure. In comparison with typical laparoscopic surgery, RALP offers surgeons three-dimensional vision and such improvements as better magnification and hand tremor filtering.\n\n""We recommend that this operation should not be done by all urologists in small community hospitals but should be focused and concentrated on high volume centers of excellence... in order to achieve best possible results for patients,"" said study author Dr. Prasanna Sooriakumaran, a visiting fellow in urology at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.\n\n""The procedure is not as easy as manufacturers make it out to be, and enthusiasm in the U.S. needs to be tempered in terms of which hospitals should be buying the equipment and which surgeons should be doing these sorts of operations,"" he added.\n\nOne caution, though, is that the study only looked at three surgeons performing RALP.\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">For the 2nd time this week, we ask if journalists – and the news consuming public – are in this much of a rush to get preliminary findings.

Manufacturers cite healthy antioxidants and heart benefits,"['The Claim: Red palm oil, a deep orange fat pressed from the palm tree fruit, is a superfood—packed with healthy antioxidants and good for the heart, say companies who sell it.\n\nThe Verdict: The colorful oil is rich in tocotrienols, nutrients in the vitamin E family, and carotenoids, which the body converts into vitamin A. Several studies suggest possible benefits in stroke and liver disease from vitamin extracts made from the oil, but so far there isn’t proof that consuming the oil can ward off disease, scientists say.\n\n“There’s not enough evidence to say that it’s good for health, but if you like the flavor of it, now and then for an indulgence, I think it’s OK,” says Penny M. Kris-Etherton, a professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nRed palm oil is produced in several areas, including Malaysia, West Africa and Ecuador. Oil pressed from the flesh of the fruit of the palm tree is naturally a deep orange color. But most palm fruit oil is bleached and refined at high temperatures, resulting in a yellow oil used in the food and cosmetics industries, says Johari Minal, Washington, D.C., regional manager of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, a government agency that promotes the country’s palm-oil industry. Red palm oil is refined either at lower temperatures or not heated at all during final processing, causing it to retain color and nutrients, he says.\n\nFlavors vary depending on the processing. Ola-Ola Carotino oil, $6.99 for 35.2 ounces, is heated briefly during refining and has a bland, neutral flavor comparable to other cooking oils, says Unnikrishnan R. Unnithan, executive director of Malaysia’s Carotino Sdn. Bhd.; the company also sells a more flavorful version intended for ethnic cooking.\n\nPhoto: DANNY KIM FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nOther oils, such as Nutiva Inc.’s red palm oil from Ecuador, $8.99 for 15 ounces, are filtered instead of heated during refining. Nutiva’s oil has a flavor some people say is like spicy carrots. It can be used as a salad dressing and drizzled on hummus and popcorn, says Nutiva Chief Executive John W. Roulac.\n\nA tablespoon of red palm oil is about 130 calories, similar to other oils. About 40% of red palm oil is oleic acid, an unsaturated fat present in higher quantities in olive oil and believed to be part of the reason for its heart benefits. Palmitic acid—a saturated fat that makes up about another 40% of red palm oil and was long considered to be implicated in heart disease—is “neutral at best” based on newer evidence, says David L. Katz, director of Yale University’s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. Healthwise, red palm oil is clearly preferable to oil made from the kernel, which is about 80% saturated fat and widely used in packaged foods, Dr. Katz says. But compared with known healthy oils such as olive, walnut, avocado and canola oil, which is rich in omega-3s, benefit is “by no means obvious,” he adds.\n\nThis product contains red palm oil extracts from Malaysia’s ExcelVite. Photo: Botanical Craft\n\nThe best case for a health benefit for red palm oil comes from its high vitamin content. A tablespoon of Nutiva oil contains 25% of the recommended daily serving of vitamin E and 240% of the recommended daily serving of vitamin A. According to a 2010 review published in the Journal of American College of Nutrition, scientists in developing countries have found Carotino and other red palm oils to be an effective method of treating vitamin A deficiency, which can lead to blindness.\n\nRed palm oil contains various types of vitamin E, including four tocotrienols, antioxidants some scientists think may be good for the cardiovascular system. In a two-year, 121-person study published in 2014 in the journal Stroke, a tocotrienol-rich dietary supplement made from red palm oil reduced “white matter lesions,” or small areas of damage to the brain that can be caused by strokes so minor a person might not be aware they happened; such small strokes can lead to cognitive impairment. The tocotrienols appear to have had a “protective effect” resulting in less damage to brain tissues from the strokes, says co-author Kah Hay Yuen, a professor at the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia.\n\nThe study was funded by the Malaysian palm board and Dr. Yuen is a paid consultant to Hovid Bhd., which sells the supplement; the same ingredient is available in the U.S. from various companies under the names EvNol Suprabio and Tocomin Suprabio, says Bryan See, a U.S. regional product manager for Malaysia’s ExcelVite Sdn. Bhd., which supplies the ingredient. A 2013 study, also co-written by Dr. Yuen, found a beneficial effect on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\nNutiva says red palm oil can be drizzled on popcorn. Photo: DANNY KIM FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nDeforestation by palm-oil producers, harming wildlife habitats, has been a world-wide concern. A Page One article in The Wall Street Journal last week explored reports of forced labor and poor conditions for migrant workers on Malaysian palm oil plantations. All red palm oil from Malaysia, including Carotino, is produced by companies certified by the not-for-profit Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil as using sustainable methods and using legal workers who make at least minimum wage, says the Malaysian palm oil board’s Mr. Minal. The Roundtable’s members include palm-oil producers and processors, consumer-goods manufacturers and some environmental and social groups. Nutiva says its oil is sustainably produced by family farms in Ecuador and workers are paid more than local minimum wage.\n\nWrite to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com']","In a time when new supplements and “superfoods” are constantly marketed to consumers who have a general sense that something is “good for you,” this piece delivers the goods with a review of the evidence, or lack thereof, for red palm oil.","The “Verdict” of this story on red palm oil may not be what marketers want to read, but this overview story packs a delicious and nutritious serving of information for consumers trying to see through swirling health claims.

WHICH DRUG TO TAKE? WHICH DRUG TO TAKE? Gabriel Hortobagyi of Houston\'s M.D. Anderson Cancer Center says: • Younger women may choose tamoxifen; it prevents more cancers and hasn\'t been shown to cause endometrial cancer before menopause. It\'s also probably the best choice for postmenopausal women without a uterus. • Postmenopausal women may opt for raloxifene. It\'s safe and still offers a lot of protection. HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS A common osteoporosis drug, raloxifene, reduces breast cancer risk by 38% in women at high risk for the disease, without causing the serious side effects of similar drugs, a new study shows. That suggests more high-risk women should consider taking raloxifene, also known as Evista, says Victor Vogel, main author of the study presented Monday at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington. READER FORUM: Living with Cancer BREAST PROBLEMS: Linked to teen girls\' drinking EXPERTS: One-third of breast cancer cases avoidable ""It\'s not a cure ... but it\'s an important protection for women who are at very high risk,"" says Vogel, who followed nearly 20,000 high-risk, postmenopausal women for almost seven years. Both raloxifene and another drug, tamoxifen, are approved to prevent breast cancer in women at high risk. Few women take them for prevention, however, because of concerns about side effects. Tamoxifen reduces breast cancer by 50% but can also cause hot flashes and other symptoms. So about half of breast cancer patients, who often take it to prevent a relapse, stop the drug early, says study co-author Lawrence Wickerham of Allegheny General Hospital. Tamoxifen also doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, from about one in 1,000 women to about two in 1,000, according to the National Cancer Institute, so many doctors are cautious about prescribing it. Given these concerns, no more than 5% of high-risk women today ""even consider taking"" either drug, says Gabriel Hortobagyi of Houston\'s M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, who wasn\'t involved with the study but will participate in a panel discussion at the conference. ""The impact of these drugs is huge,"" he says. ""The only thing that reduces the risk as much is a bilateral mastectomy."" The new study — which shows that raloxifene doesn\'t substantially increase the risk of endometrial cancer — should put those concerns to rest, says co-author Patricia Ganz, who runs a clinic for high-risk women at the University of California-Los Angeles. ""We have two very effective agents for breast cancer prevention,"" Ganz says. ""If women were not so risk-averse, we might actually be able to reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women."" A typical American woman has about a 12% chance of getting breast cancer in her lifetime. That risk rises to about 18% for a woman whose mother or sister has had the disease, and to 30% for a woman with a breast lesion called atypical hyperplasia, Ganz says.

It\'s crazy enough to laugh off.\n\nBut here\'s the thing: BYU researchers have discovered certain compounds found in cocoa can actually help your body release more insulin and respond to increased blood glucose better. Insulin is the hormone that manages glucose, the blood sugar that reaches unhealthy levels in diabetes.\n\nOf course, there\'s a catch.\n\n""You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don\'t want it to have a lot of sugar in it,"" said study author Jeffery Tessem, assistant professor of nutrition, dietetics and food science at BYU. ""It\'s the compound in cocoa you\'re after.""\n\nWhen a person has diabetes, their body either doesn\'t produce enough insulin or doesn\'t process blood sugar properly. At the root of that is the failure of beta cells, whose job it is to produce insulin. The new study, published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, finds beta cells work better and remain stronger with an increased presence of epicatechin monomers, compounds found naturally in cocoa.\n\nTo discover this, collaborators at Virginia Tech first fed the cocoa compound to animals on a high-fat diet. They found that by adding it to the high-fat diet, the compound would decrease the level of obesity in the animals and would increase their ability to deal with increased blood glucose levels.\n\nThe BYU team, comprised of graduate and undergraduate students in Tessem\'s lab and the labs of Ben Bikman and Jason Hansen (BYU professors of physiology and developmental biology), then dove in and dissected what was happening on the cellular level -- specifically, the beta cell level. That\'s when they learned cocoa compounds named epicatechin monomers enhanced beta cells\' ability to secrete insulin.\n\n""What happens is it\'s protecting the cells, it\'s increasing their ability to deal with oxidative stress,"" Tessem said. ""The epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger, which produces more ATP (a cell\'s energy source), which then results in more insulin being released.""\n\nWhile there has been a lot of research on similar compounds over the past decade, no one has been able to pinpoint which ones are the most beneficial or how exactly they bring about any benefit -- until now. This research shows the epicatechin monomers, the smallest of the compounds, are the most effective.\n\n""These results will help us get closer to using these compounds more effectively in foods or supplements to maintain normal blood glucose control and potentially even delay or prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes,"" said study co-author Andrew Neilson, assistant professor of food science at Virginia Tech.\n\nBut rather than stocking up on the sugar-rich chocolate bars at the checkout line, researchers believe the starting point is to look for ways to take the compound out of cocoa, make more of it and then use it as a potential treatment for current diabetes patients. This research was funded, in part, thanks to grants from the Diabetes Action Research and Education Foundation and the American Diabetes Association.\n\n###']",The headline and lead paragraphs about chocolate overwhelm the details and cautionary statements buried below.,"BYU photo captioned “Chocolate as a medical aid?”
This news release tortures the results of a basic biology cell culture study until it coughs up a headline about cocoa preventing diabetes. Researchers isolated several compounds from cocoa and found that one of them (but not the others) appeared to help rat cells in a lab dish secrete more insulin. But the headline and lead paragraphs about chocolate overwhelm the details and cautionary statements buried below. In particular, the photographs provided with the release show Hershey’s chocolate bars spilling out of medicine bottles that are blatantly labeled as “Dark Chocolate” and “Take by mouth as needed or desired.” Only a profile photo of two researchers gives a hint of the lab dishes, rat cells and esoteric compounds that were the real aspects of the study.

In a study published this week in mBio®, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team shows that a live, attenuated version of the Zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer.\n\nGlioblastoma kills about 15,000 adults in the US each year and is currently incurable because patients experience a high recurrence rate of their cancer even after the standard treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Scientists suspect this recurrence is due to cancer stem cells, called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which hide out in nearby brain tissue even after the combination of therapies.\n\n""During the Zika epidemic, we learned that the virus preferentially infects neural progenitor cells in the fetus, and causes the devastating microcephaly seen in babies born to infected mothers,"" says Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He co-led the current study with tumor biologist Jianghong Man of the National Center of Biomedical Analysis in Beijing and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.\n\n""We made the connection that perhaps Zika virus could also specifically infect the GSCs,"" because these cells have similar properties to neural stem cells, says Man. In previous work, Shi and his collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis showed that Zika virus did indeed attack and kill GSCs grown in the lab dish and in a mouse model of glioblastoma. In addition, the Zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated, healthy brain cells. (image: transmission electron micrograph of Zika virus, NIAID)\n\n""If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,"" says Qin.\n\nThe team\'s first objective was to determine if there was a safe way to use Zika virus in patients to attack the cancer cells. Shi\'s lab has developed a promising live-attenuated Zika vaccine candidate called ZIKV-LAV that had been shown to be safe, non-virulent, and effective in protecting against infection in mice and non-human primates. The ZIKV-LAV has a small deletion from the viral genome that prevents it from replicating itself efficiently.\n\nWhen the team injected this ZIKV-LAV into the brains of mice, they saw no health effects on the mice, no weight loss, and no behavioral abnormalities such as loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, or self-injury. The mice also functioned normally in tests for anxiety and motor function.\n\nNext, the team wanted to show whether the ZIKA-LAV could work to infect and kill human patient-derived GSCs in a mouse model. So they mixed GSCs from two different human patient donors with the ZIKA-LAV and injected the mixture into the brains of mice. Mice that got the injection of the GSCs only rapidly developed tumors. Mice that got the ZIKV-LAV injected as well saw a significant delay in tumor development. Co-implanting the virus along with the GSCs also prolonged the median survival time of the treated mice to around 50 days, compared to around 30 days for the untreated mice who received GSCs alone.\n\nQin says that perhaps in the future patients would be given the Zika vaccine at the same time as surgery to ""let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them.""\n\nFinally, the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified Zika virus used to kill the GSCs. They took GSCs treated with the ZIKV-LAV and those GSCs not treated and sequenced all the RNA messages being expressed in these two cell populations. Comparing those profiles, the team found that in the treated cells, the virus triggered a strong antiviral response in the cells, which induced inflammation and eventually cell death.\n\nNext, the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the ZIKV-LAV in glioblastoma patients. They may also modify the Zika virus further to make it an even more potent cancer cell killing machine. For example, Man explains, the researchers could add an immune modulator as a \'cargo\' in the viral genome. Then, once such a virus infects a cancer cell and kills it, the immune modulator would be released to alert and activate the patient\'s systemic immune system against the remaining cancer cells.\n\n""As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the \'bad\' side of viruses,"" says Shi. ""They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.""\n\n###\n\nThe American Society for Microbiology is the largest single life science society, composed of more than 30,000 scientists and health professionals. ASM\'s mission is to promote and advance the microbial sciences.\n\nASM advances the microbial sciences through conferences, publications, certifications and educational opportunities. It enhances laboratory capacity around the globe through training and resources. It provides a network for scientists in academia, industry and clinical settings. Additionally, ASM promotes a deeper understanding of the microbial sciences to diverse audiences.']",The release would have benefited from a strong caution that outcomes from research in mice are seldom replicated in human studies.,"This news release summarizes a study in which researchers deployed a Zika virus vaccine to target and kill human glioblastoma brain cancer stem cells, which had been transplanted into mice.
Some of the weaknesses of a Newsweek story on this research which we also reviewed can be found in the news release. Namely, it lacks a discussion of potential harms in humans; fails to include a description of the evidence along with study limitations; and doesn’t provide strong cautions that outcomes in mice are seldom replicated in human studies.

Then, moments after birth, that cord is severed.\n\nNow, research suggests there may be benefits to keeping mom and baby attached a few minutes longer.\n\nThose benefits, researchers say, likely have to do with iron.\n\nWaiting a few minutes before clamping the umbilical cord allows more iron-rich blood from the placenta to reach the newborn.\n\nIron deficiency occurs in about one in six American babies, and it\'s more common among those clamped quickly, said Ola Andersson, a neonatologist and pediatrician at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led a study published today in JAMA Pediatrics. Babies who are anemic often appear tired and pale.\n\nHis previous research has shown that babies whose cords were clamped a few minutes later than usual were 90% less likely than others to have iron-deficiency anemia when they were 4 months old.\n\nThe benefits of those extra few minutes may last a long time.\n\nIn the new study, Andersson found that healthy, full-term newborns whose umbilical cords were left attached for three extra minutes had better fine motor control when they reached preschool than those clamped immediately. Some 4-year-old boys who were clamped later even appeared to have better social skills.\n\nIron is essential to the developing brain, he said, and deficiencies during early months — perhaps linked to early clamping — could affect nerve and muscle control, making it harder for the child to later control a pen or interact comfortably with peers.\n\nAndersson\'s study marks the first time researchers have followed children to see whether the clamping makes a difference later in life. In 2011, he published a study of 400 healthy, full-term babies showing that those clamped later fared better; the new study of 263 of those children extends those findings by nearly four years.\n\nBoys showed more benefit than girls, probably because they are more likely to be iron-deficient, Andersson said.\n\nImmediate clamping started about 70 years ago out of concern that leaving the delivered infant attached to the placenta could rob the mother of too much blood.\n\nBut those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn\'t look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nFor babies born at full-term, ""we should trust nature more than we do now,"" she said.\n\nRabe has published reviews showing that delaying clamping for 30 seconds, or squeezing the umbilical cord to get the blood out faster, is also better for premature babies.\n\nMany countries and professional organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have called on obstetricians to delay cord clamping in premature babies when feasible. There was not enough evidence before to extend that recommendation to full-term babies, but Rabe thinks this study should tip the balance in favor of delay.\n\nKjersti Aagaard, vice chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\'s Hospital, is more skeptical. She said the decision about when to clamp should be made between the doctor and parents, depending on the delivery, the health of the baby and the mother\'s condition.\n\n""The most important thing for parents to be talking with their provider about is how will we adapt to the delivery as it emerges,"" she said.']",Not a bad effort — but not quite as thorough as a ,"
Despite its four-star score, this story has the potential to lead casual readers astray, since it’s not quite as careful as a competitor NPR story in describing the potential benefits and harms of leaving newborns’ umbilical cords attached to Mom longer. Both stories reported on a study of only 263 children in Sweden that showed modest improvements in fine-motor skills for children whose cords were left intact for three minutes instead of cut after ten seconds. But this story didn’t give much context — it launches headlong into the potential reasons why delayed clamping might help, without carefully weighing the harms and considering the quality of the evidence.

Lay Off the Drugs,"['It’s easy to get into the habit of popping a pill to have a good night’s sleep. Insomnia, which affects a third of adults, becomes more common as we age.\n\nBut as evidence has mounted about the risks of drugging the brain to induce or maintain slumber, more doctors are steering patients away from sleep aids, including over-the-counter medications, and are offering innovative behavioral-change solutions.\n\nAfter reviewing more than 15 years of evidence, the American College of Physicians in May issued new guidelines for the management of chronic insomnia, recommending a form of counseling known as cognitive behavioral therapy as the first-line treatment for all adults. Drugs should be considered only if the therapy is unsuccessful, and only for a short course after a thorough discussion of the benefits, harms and costs, the guidelines say.\n\n“Drugs don’t provide a natural sleep, and the side effects are significant,” says Nitin Damle, an internist and president of the American College of Physicians. “It’s true in all age groups, but even more problematic for older adults.”\n\nIn addition to their addictive properties, many prescription sleep aids can cause fuzzy thinking and memory gaps in the short term—like being unaware of taking a drive, eating or making phone calls. As bodies age, drugs remain longer in the body due to changes such as diminished liver and kidney function, which can cause fatigue, weakness, impaired balance and a dimming of other senses, increasing the risk for falls and car accidents. Longer term, sleep drugs may contribute to more serious mental-function issues, they can be costly, and they may not be covered by insurance for more than a short period.\n\nAmong the most commonly prescribed drugs are sedative hypnotics, which slow activity in the brain to bring on sleep. They include drugs known as benzodiazapenes, sold under brand names like Halcion, and non-benzodiazapenes, such as Ambien, Lunesta and Sonata. The American Geriatrics Society recommends against using benzodiazepines or other sedative hypnotics in older adults as first choice for insomnia because large-scale studies consistently show that the risk or motor-vehicle accidents, falls and hip fractures leading to hospitalization and death can more than double in older adults taking the drugs.\n\nA new class of drugs known as orexin receptor antagonists act differently than sedative hypnotics, inhibiting the action of a chemical that promotes wakefulness. One, suvorexant, sold as Belsomra, helped people fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer in studies comparing it to a placebo, with no evidence of physical dependence after prolonged use or reports of withdrawal symptoms after stopping the drug. But as with other medications it has the potential to produce drowsiness the next day that might interfere with daily activities, and carries a warning that it may cause sleepwalking or other activities while asleep, like eating, talking, having sex or driving.\n\nOver-the-counter drugs can be risky, too, such as pain medications with sleep aids that include the antihistamine diphenhydramine, part of a type of drugs known as anticholinergics. A study last year in JAMA Internal Medicine suggested higher cumulative use of anticholinergics, which can impair memory and attention, is associated with an increased risk for dementia.\n\nDoctors may initially prescribe sleeping pills when a patient is under stress. “The intent is for them to be on a short course, and then get off of it,” says David Maness, a professor of family medicine at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. “But then the problem is perpetuated, and before you know it, it’s 10 years later, and it keeps getting refilled and no one has reviewed it.”\n\nA review that Dr. Maness co-wrote, published last December by the American Academy of Family Physicians, suggests that a combination of nondrug therapies can help patients just say no to sleep drugs.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, which can be delivered in as few as two sessions with a trained therapist or nurse, has been shown to relieve chronic insomnia and improve daytime functioning for up to two years.\n\n“ Drugs don’t provide a natural sleep, and the side effects are significant ” —Nitin Damle, President, American College of Physicians\n\nTypically, patients are asked to fill out a sleep diary, recording their bedtime, rise time and how long it takes to fall asleep. The patients also record factors such as the number of naps, alcoholic beverages and stresses in a day. Writing down troubling thoughts and worries before bedtime may help clear the mind, making it easier to fall asleep, according to the National Sleep Foundation. One aim of cognitive behavioral therapy is to pinpoint actions that may be prohibiting sleep, and thus develop a customized list of do’s and don’ts for optimal “sleep hygiene.”\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nSome are obvious, like sleeping in a cool, dark room, and avoiding caffeine, alcohol and tobacco before bedtime. (Contrary to popular belief, alcohol is a deterrent to a sound sleep.) Others are more ingenious: To avoid literally watching the sleepless hours go by, hide the clock.\n\nRelaxation training can help as well, including yoga, and techniques to relax muscles from the feet to the face.\n\nOnce patients are dependent on sleep drugs, going cold turkey can just make things worse, says Sean Jeffrey, director of clinical pharmacy services at Hartford Healthcare and a clinical professor at the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy. He advises patients on a tapering-off schedule “so it doesn’t feel like you are ripping off a band-aid.”\n\nDr. Jeffrey encourages patients to exercise and get outdoors in bright morning sunlight to help set the body’s clock for sleep in the evening.\n\nMs. Landro, a Wall Street Journal assistant managing editor, writes the Informed Patient column. Email: laura.landro@wsj.com.']","Because it lacks information on costs, readers can’t answer an important question: Can I afford it?","This story explains why those suffering from insomnia should take heed of the American College of Physicians’ recommendation to use cognitive behavioral therapy as a first-line treatment, before turning to prescription or over-the-counter drugs.
Rather than focusing on the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy, as a New York Times story we reviewed earlier this year did, the Wall Street Journal story lays out the serious side effects associated with insomnia drugs, providing a clear and easily understood discussion of why drug treatment should be considered a last resort, to be used only by those for whom cognitive behavioral therapy has failed.
However, the story would have been stronger if it had discussed the costs of treatments, and provided more specific numbers on how beneficial these treatment options are in clinical research.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nWomen treated with a combination pacemaker and defibrillator device had a 70 percent reduction in heart failure compared with a 35 percent decline in men, they said.\n\n“Our finding was unexpected, but extremely important because this is the only heart treatment that is clearly better in women than men,” Dr. Arthur Moss of the University of Rochester Medical Center, whose study appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, said in a statement.\n\nThe findings come from a large Boston Scientific study of cardiac resynchronization therapy known as MADIT-CRT, in which a pacemaker is used to restore normal coordinated heart beats in people whose damaged hearts are less efficient at pumping blood.\n\nThe device also included a defibrillator used to shock dangerous heart beats back into normal rhythm.\n\nThe original study, published in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed patients fared better with a combination cardiac resynchronization therapy and a defibrillator rather than a defibrillator alone.\n\nBut it also suggested that women benefited more from resynchronization therapy than men. In the latest study, Moss and colleagues explore how much better women did, and why.\n\n“We found there was a dramatic reduction not only in heart failure events, but a very dramatic reduction in death from any cause,” Moss said in a telephone interview.\n\n“This was far greater than expected. Men got a good result but women got a fantastic result,” he said.\n\n“We think this is the first (study) to show this.”\n\nMoss said women have often been overlooked in studies of heart disease, which until recently were dominated by men.\n\nOther studies have shown heart attack symptoms are much different in women than in men, something that has been publicized with the American Heart Association’s “Go Red for Women” campaign.\n\nIn the MADIT-CRT trial, women were more likely to suffer heart failure caused by a viral infection of the heart, whereas in men, the condition is more often caused by blocked heart arteries, Moss said.\n\nWomen are also more likely to experience a condition known as left bundle branch block, a pattern of disorganized electrical impulses that responds well when the left side of the heart is treated with a pacemaker.\n\nWomen tend to have smaller hearts than men and Moss said the treatment works better in smaller hearts.\n\nBoston Scientific’s device was originally approved to treat severe heart failure, but last September, U.S. regulators extended the approval to patients with mild heart failure.\n\nIn November, Medtronic Inc showed its heart failure device helped mild heart failure and its study also suggested women benefited more than men.\n\nCurrently, 42 million American women are living with heart disease. It is the leading killer of women in the United States, claiming more women each year than men.""]","The benefits were described in a confusing way. There was nothing about harms, costs or possible alternative treatments. And the end of the story conflated heart failure and heart disease.","The story didn’t deliver the numbers and the explanations to help readers evaluate the evidence.
It is not clear from the story what ‘a 70% reduction in heart failure compared with a 35% decline in men’ actually means.

Connolly, director of Harvard’s Center for Global Tobacco Control and a co-author of the study. “I ran a treatment program for years, and we invested” millions in treatment services.\n\nDoctors who treat smokers said that the study findings were not unexpected, given the haphazard way many smokers used the products. “Patient compliance is a very big issue,” said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the Mayo Clinic , who was not involved in the study.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Hurt said products like nicotine gum and patches “are absolutely essential, but we use them in combinations and doses that match treatment to what the individual patient needs,” unlike smokers who are self-treating.\n\nThe products have been controversial since at least 2002, when researchers at the University of California, San Diego , reported from a large survey that they appeared to offer no benefit.

It also appears to have less risk of causing lung problems than its inhaled predecessor, Exubera.\n\n""Afrezza is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin, and clinical studies have shown us that it has the potential to change diabetes therapy, because in the body, Afrezza looks like the insulin that\'s normally in a person\'s body,"" said Andrea Leone-Bay, vice president of pharmaceutical development for MannKind Corp., manufacturer of Afreeza.\n\n""Afrezza differs a lot from Exubera,"" she said, both in the way it\'s made and in the way it works.\n\nAfrezza uses a novel technology called Technosphere, according to Leone-Bay. It\'s inhaled as a dry powder that dissolves in the lungs. The particles then pass through the lungs into the bloodstream and begin acting almost immediately. Afrezza\'s action peaks about 12 to 15 minutes after inhalation, instead of the 45 to 60 minutes it takes for Exubera to peak, she said.\n\nThat fast action helps to keep after-meal blood sugar levels lower, which is a goal for people with diabetes. And Afrezza is less likely to cause hypoglycemia, a common problem that occurs when insulin levels are higher than required for a meal.\n\nThe idea of an inhaled insulin appeals to diabetics who must use insulin every time they eat. Currently, the only way to get that insulin is through injection or an insulin pump that must be inserted in a new site under the skin every few days.\n\nIn 2006, the first inhaled insulin, Exubera, received FDA approval. However, the drug was pulled from the market in October 2007 by its manufacturer, Pfizer, because of disappointing sales. From the beginning, concerns surfaced about the effects the drug might have on the lungs. One study found a reduction in lung function for some, but of more concern was an increased risk of lung cancer associated with its use. This finding came after Exubera had been pulled from the market, and the sample size wasn\'t large enough to draw a definitive link between the drug and the increased risk of lung cancer.\n\nLeone-Bay said that cancer studies have been conducted on Afrezza in rats. The rats got a much higher inhalation dose than humans would take, and the researchers didn\'t find an increase in lung cancer. She said these types of studies weren\'t done on Exubera.\n\n""They have done the required safety studies and come out clean, but it\'s only been tested for six months, so long-term isn\'t known,"" said Sanjoy Dutta, director of the insulin initiative at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\nDutta confirmed that Afrezza is fast-acting and less likely to cause low blood sugar. ""Just as quickly as it has an onset of action, it also has a quick off mechanism. It doesn\'t stay around long enough to cause hypoglycemia,"" he said.\n\nWhile Afrezza looks promising, it can\'t replace all injections for people with diabetes. Because it\'s fast-acting, it can\'t provide the long action of insulin known as basal insulin. It will only replace meal-time insulin.\n\nAfrezza may have an impact on lung function, but Leone-Bay said once people stopped taking Afrezza, this effect went away. The company is conducting clinical trials to assess Afrezza in people with asthma.\n\nLeone-Bay was to explain the Technosphere technology Tuesday at the American Chemical Society annual meeting in San Francisco. MannKind hopes the technology used in Afrezza might help deliver drugs that treat pain and osteoporosis, too.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about both types of diabetes and treatments from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.']","A drug company VP is the main source quoted in this story.  Could be one reason the story is long on ""promise"" but short on evidence. ","The story reads like an advertisement for the therapeutic superiority of a new treatment for diabetes — a treatment that has not been approved by the FDA, a treatment about which the FDA has requested more data before it can decide whether it’s worth approving.  Neither the article’s author nor anyone interviewed described the details of any clinical trial data that might back up the dramatic claims of superiority.

They carry a risk of infection and can be risky to remove if they malfunction. But they save lives when the heart stops beating efficiently.\n\nThe new system requires three incisions on the front and side of the chest and no special equipment to implant. It is made by the privately held Cameron Health, founded by Dr. Gust Bardy of the Seattle Institute for Cardiac Research, who led the study. The company paid for the two small studies described in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n“This device provides protection against a problem that affects at least 200,000 Americans a year, is the single leading cause of death, and avoids short- and long-term problems” associated with conventional implantable defibrillators, Bardy said in a telephone interview.\n\nBardy said the device, which is approved for use in Europe but not the United States, goes back to the original design for defibrillators.\n\nEarly defibrillators put the electrodes on the skin, but required too much power to make them truly portable. The answer was to place the electrodes in the heart so the power requirements would be less. With more available power, the shock can once again originate from outside the heart.\n\nThe device costs roughly as much as a conventional implantable defibrillator, but associated costs are less, Bardy said. It can be implanted in any sterile room and a facility with X-ray capability is not necessary.\n\n“If there is a complication to the system, it’s going to be limited perhaps to bleeding under the skin or infection under the skin. It’s not bleeding in the chest or an infection in the chest, so presumably the costs related to that are going to go down,” he said.\n\n“If you’re not going into the blood vessels, and you’re not going into the lung space and you’re not going into the heart, it’s logical that you’re not going to have those often serious complications,” Bardy said.\n\nLong-term use was tested in 61 volunteers. The researchers said the rate of unnecessary shocks was low and it corrected all 12 instances where the heart developed a dangerous rhythm.\n\n“The device is behaving very well,” Bardy said.\n\nThe research team said a larger study will be needed to prove that the device is as good as conventional implantable defibrillators.']","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">The shorter of two stories we reviewed that report the results of trials of a new type of implantable heart defibrillator. Although the story reports many of the key points readers need to know, a few elements were missing.</span>","

 Readers are told that further trials are needed, but while key potential benefits of the new type of device are outlined, the story does not mention problems that the researchers encountered in these early trials. The most important missing element in this story is comment from a source who does not have financial or other ties to the research or device manufacturer.

Smith, a prostate cancer specialist at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nAlso, bone scans actually measure bone formation, not the presence of cancer itself. So it cannot be completely ruled out that XL184 somehow stopped bone growth without killing the cancer. However, Dr. Smith said he doubted that was the case because there were signs the drug also controlled tumors outside the bones.\n\nDrugs now used to treat advanced prostate cancer, like Taxotere, do not have much affect on bone scans, Dr. Smith said. Bone drugs like Zometa from Novartis and denosumab from Amgen can protect cancerous bones from fractures, but have not been shown to fight the cancer itself.\n\nAnother investigator in the trial, Dr. David C. Smith of the University of Michigan, said he could not believe it when the bone scan of one patient, who previously had widespread cancer in his bones, came back completely clean.\n\n“I thought they had scanned the wrong person,” said Dr. Smith, who is not related to the doctor in Massachusetts. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”\n\nExelixis will now add many prostate cancer patients to the midstage clinical trial from which the results were drawn, said Michael M. Morrissey, the company’s chief executive.

He realized that reimbursement by regional Medicare contractors was inconsistent, so he decided the agency should have a uniform national policy.\n\nThe Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee, which met in Baltimore, did not discuss the cost of Provenge or make a coverage recommendation. It reviewed the clinical trial data and then rated the strength of the data on a scale of 1 to 5.\n\nThe 10 voting members, mainly doctors and health policy experts, averaged 3.6 on the question of how much confidence they had that there was adequate evidence to conclude that Provenge significantly prolongs survival.\n\nThat is between 3, which is intermediate confidence and 5, which is high confidence. But some analysts said that should be enough for reimbursement. Trading in Dendreon shares, halted during regular market hours, rose 6 percent after hours.\n\nHowever, the panel gave very low scores to evidence that the drug would help prostate cancer patients other than the type who participated in the clinical trial, which were men with advanced cancer, but no or minimal symptoms. That could give Medicare grounds for denying payment when the drug is used off-label, as cancer drugs often are.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMedicare is scheduled to put a proposed decision out for comment by March 30, with a final decision around the end of June.\n\nProvenge has stirred passions since the F.D.A. initially declined to approve it in 2007. Some Dendreon investors and prostate cancer patients staged protests and advertising campaigns and sued the F.D.A. Two doctors who had spurred investor wrath by voting against the drug’s approval at an advisory committee meeting attended a major cancer conference accompanied by bodyguards.\n\nMedicare’s review has drawn hundreds of comments, mostly in favor of coverage. One criticism of the drug was filed by a law firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, on behalf of a client who the law firm said wanted to remain anonymous because of the “public vilification of anyone that questions Provenge.”""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Starting with its headline, this story promotes promise.

The fact is that this story is based on a very early and incomplete report of an ongoing phase 2 trial. </span>","Notwithstanding the headline, this is a story about two drugs for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer – Provenge, a drug recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and XL184, a compound currently under study.  Combining the information for these treatments is a bit confusing.  The news about XL184 reflected results which at that point had not yet been presented at a cancer conference in Berlin.  While indicating that it is too early to say whether XL184 actually affects the cancer, the story should have reminded readers of the importance of things like quality of life and survival time. And there isn’t evidence about those factors yet with XL184. At issue is that, while advanced prostate cancer is a challenge, not all men with advanced prostate cancer would benefit from Provenge, though the story neglected this.  And it is not clear that XL184 is of benefit to anyone.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nBut not a whole lot.\n\nAlthough the precise estimate is still uncertain, researchers found that people who started taking zinc-loaded lozenges or syrups within 24 hours of showing symptoms — a sore throat, say, or runny nose — shortened their cold by one day. By comparison, a normal cold lasts about a week.\n\nStill, with an infection that currently has no good treatment and leads to an estimated 275 million lost work days a year in the U.S., well, what a difference a day makes.\n\nThe review, published by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research, also shows that people taking the supplements tended to have milder symptoms.\n\n“I think one can give it a try,” said Dr. Meenu Singh, a pediatrician at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India, who led the new work.\n\n“But giving zinc over a long period of time for prevention should be done very carefully,” she told Reuters Health.\n\nZinc may interfere with other metals in the body, and that may have unpredictable consequences over the long haul, Singh said.\n\nAn earlier Cochrane review from 1999 didn’t find any signs that zinc supplements would work. But since then several new studies - known as randomized controlled trials - have been completed.\n\nThe new review is based on 13 trials with 966 participants who either took zinc or a dummy treatment at the beginning of their symptoms. Another two trials found that zinc helped stave off colds, but the quality of that research was low.\n\nThe bottom line: After seven days of treatment, those taking the supplements had less than half the chance of still being sick.\n\nA typical adult has a few colds every year. While the episodes usually aren’t serious, the resulting visits to the doctor alone cost the U.S. an annual $7.7 billion, according to the new report.\n\nSingh said the side effects of zinc lozenges, which can be bought for a few dollars in any drug store in the U.S., come down to bad taste and some cases of nausea.\n\nThe researchers did not study nasal zinc remedies, however.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned Matrixx Initiatives to stop selling its widely used supplement Zicam after more than 130 users reportedly lost their sense of smell.\n\nSingh said there was no evidence of a similar danger from the lozenges or syrups.\n\nExactly how well zinc works is a matter of future research, and the one day estimate may well change, the researchers note.

But for the full-bodied person who is not so rich, unroasted coffee beans — green as the day they were picked — may hold the key to cheap and effective weight loss, new research suggests.\n\nIn a study presented Tuesday at the American Chemical Society’s spring national meeting in San Diego, 16 overweight young adults took, by turns, a low dose of green coffee bean extract, a high dose of the supplement, and a placebo. Though the study was small, the results were striking: Subjects lost an average of 17.5 pounds in 22 weeks and reduced their overall body weight by 10.5%.\n\nIf green coffee extract were a medication seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration, these results would make it a viable candidate — more than 35% of subjects lost more than 5% of their body weight, and weight loss appeared to be greater while subjects were taking the pills than when they were on the placebo.\n\nBut as a dietary supplement, green coffee extract does not require the FDA’s blessing. In fact, it is already available as a naturopathic medicine and antioxidant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Vinson, the University of Scranton chemist who conducted the pilot study, said the findings should pave the way for more rigorous research on coffee bean extract’s effects. A larger trial involving 60 people is being planned.\n\nVinson, whose research focuses on plant polyphenols and their effects on human health, said it appears that green coffee bean extract may work by reducing the absorption of fat and glucose in the gut; it may also reduce insulin levels, which would improve metabolic function. There were no signs of ill effects on any subjects, Vinson reported Tuesday.\n\nThe study used a “cross-over” design, which allowed each subject to serve as his or her own comparison group. For six weeks, volunteers swallowed capsules three times a day, ingesting either 700 or 1,050 milligrams of green coffee extract a day or taking a placebo. After a two-week break, they moved, round-robin style, to another arm of the trial.\n\nSubjects did not change their calorie intake over the course of the trial. But the more extract they consumed, the more weight and fat they lost. Altogether, they reduced their body fat by 16%, on average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the 16 volunteers, six wound up with a body mass index in the healthful range.\n\nOne downside is that the extract is “extremely bitter.” It would be difficult to take without a lot of water, Vinson reported.\n\nAt roughly $20 per month, however, green coffee extract is much less expensive than any of the weight-loss medications available over the counter or by prescription.\n\nThe trial was conducted in India and paid for by Applied Food Sciences Inc. of Austin, Tex., a manufacturer of green coffee bean extract.\n\nThe pilot study drew strong cautions from several scientists who weren’t involved in the research.\n\n“This is certainly a provocative study,” said Dr. Gerald Weissmann, a physician and biochemist at New York University. But he said nutrition experts would want assurances that green coffee beans do not cause “malabsorption” within the human gut — a condition that would lead to weight loss as well as malnutrition, heart arrhythmias and other problems because vitamins and minerals are not passing through the intestine.\n\nDr. Arthur Grollman, a pharmacologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said coffee beans contain about 250 different chemicals — some with positive and others with negative effects on human health. Though Vinson identified polyphenols and chlorogenic acid as the agents that appear to promote weight loss, Grollman said that claim needed further study. In the meantime, he said, consuming an extract that contains both good and bad chemicals in dense concentration seems an unwise thing to do.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com']",Not much different or better than its ,"The story sounds cheerleading when it states, “If green coffee extract were a medication seeking approval from the FDA, these results would make it a viable candidate.”
That’s a pretty rah-rah definition of what makes a viable candidate.
No drug will be approved based on a 16-person, 6-week pilot study.  And no drug would be approved with such an absence of information about potential harms.

The participants were divided into two groups, one of which received weekly emails with generic information about healthy living that is good for the heart and for reducing high blood pressure, and the other group received weekly emails with links to interactive tools and online multimedia, such as videos of people diagnosed with high blood pressure who made lifestyle changes.

The study is very useful in telling and confirming that we should talk to the patients, no matter how we do it,” said Bernard Wong, a cardiologist based in Hong Kong.\n\nOne of the caveats of the study was that participants were highly motivated people looking for ways to cope with and decrease their blood pressure. Participants were also largely white and well-educated, with most having a postsecondary education, so the results of the study might not be generalize well to other groups.\n\nAD']",We also appreciated the discussion of how common high blood pressure is and why it’s so important to treat.,"This story describes a study comparing two groups of people with high blood pressure who either received standard online information on lowering blood pressure, or “e-Counseling,” a progressive, more interactive online program that closely mimicked face-to-face counseling.
The story had many strong points–it provided specifics on how much blood pressure was lowered in both the control group and the treatment group–and it explained the details of the study’s design, including limitations. We also appreciated the discussion of how common high blood pressure is and why it’s so important to treat.

The task force said it concluded “with moderate certainty” that the benefit was moderate in women 50 to 74 and small in women 40 to 49.\n\nFor every 10,000 women screened repeatedly over 10 years, four lives are saved in women 40 to 49; eight in women 50 to 59; 21 in women 60 to 69; and 13 in women 70 to 74, the task force found.\n\n“The science supports mammography as an important tool in the fight against breast cancer,” said Dr. Michael LeFevre, a former chairman of the task force and a professor of medicine at the University of Missouri. He noted that breast cancer deaths have decreased since mammography came into widespread use in the 1980s, though some of the decline, he said, was also due to better treatments. “We believe the benefits increase with age. But there are harms, and particularly in their 40s, women have to make a decision for themselves.”']",Exemplary reporting on a complicated issue that affects millions of women.,"The story provides an excellent overview of new recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on when, and how often, women should receive mammograms to screen for breast cancer. The story discusses the long-running debate over mammogram recommendations, as well as the differing advice that various organizations provide on when women at average risk of breast cancer should begin mammogram screening and how often they should have the tests, though the story would have been stronger if it had explained what “average risk” means (something that a competing Washington Post story on the recommendations explains well). The story also offers a good discussion of issues related to what the USPSTF recommendations may mean for insurance coverage of mammograms, though it does not tell readers how expensive mammograms may be without insurance.

Frequently having problems in school, he once threw a typewriter out of his fourth-floor window at college after making the ""hte"" mistake yet again.\n\nAbby Schwartz can relate. She would often mix up the letters d and b, sounding out certain words to make make sense of them. Things have gotten better, but she\'ll still make the occasional ""b-d"" or ""5-2"" flip. Davis, now 66, also still mixes up the digits of phone numbers.\n\n""(Reading) would be slow. It wouldn\'t be enjoyable. I would lose my place,"" said Abby, 13, of Lexington, Massachusetts. ""There were times when I would yell at myself: \'I can\'t do this. I can\'t do this. I can\'t do this.\' ""\n\nAbby and Davis, like an estimated 5 percent to 20 percent of the population, have struggled with dyslexia, a condition that, broadly speaking, hinders a person\'s ability to interpret language.\n\nScientists have recently made headway in understanding what\'s going on in the brain of a person with dyslexia, which has not been well understood. New research suggests it may be possible to tell from a brain scan whether a dyslexic child\'s reading ability will improve over a few years. It goes along with the general trend of personalized medicine, in which genetic tests, brain scans and other tests can increasingly help predict the conditions for which a particular individual is at risk.\n\nAnd a separate recent study found that some dyslexics may have a heightened understanding of space, despite an impairment in language.\n\nIn dyslexia, also called developmental reading disorder, the brain doesn\'t properly recognize or process symbols. Children with this condition may find reading comprehension difficult because they don\'t connect sounds with letters and can\'t recognize words well. Celebrities including Whoopi Goldberg, Cher and Henry Winkler (the ""Fonz"") have made their dyslexia publicly known, and great artists such as Pablo Picasso are said to have had it.\n\nSome children with the disorder can ""compensate,"" or read fairly normally, but perhaps more slowly than their peers, by adulthood. It is hard to know who will be able to improve reading skills over time, and how much extra help is necessary.\n\nA study led by Fumiko Hoeft, psychiatry researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, used brain imaging to answer this question. Her study followed 25 children with dyslexia and 20 children without dyslexia over a 2½-year period.\n\nThe researchers found greater activation and connectivity in the brain\'s right hemisphere among dyslexic children who showed greater improvement in reading after the 2½ years. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study this phenomenon.\n\nIn general, much of the language comprehension and processing that goes on in the brain happens in the left hemisphere, but there is some right hemisphere involvement also. Hoeft\'s study suggests that people with dyslexia who go on to read fairly normally are using a part of the right hemisphere in reading tasks more than the average person would.\n\nIf made widely available, this kind of brain scan could be an important complement to the assessments -- based on reading and behavior -- already available for diagnosing dyslexia, Hoeft said. As this usage of fMRI becomes more useful and commonplace, the high cost per scan would go down, she said.\n\nRebecca Branstetter, psychologist who blogs at Notes from the School Psychologist, says this dyslexia brain scan could provide useful information, but it doesn\'t highlight environmental factors -- such as the quality of instruction in the child\'s classroom -- that could contribute to reading problems.\n\nAbby\'s father, Edward Schwartz, fears that this tool would just add to a child\'s anxiety about the testing process. The potential to alarm a child isn\'t worth it, and he doesn\'t trust that this method would offer definitive information.\n\n""The kids (are) much more likely to feel like they\'re broken in some way,"" Schwartz said. Abby, he recalls, ""didn\'t like it to be referred to as a \'learning disability.\' She was happy when people offered her alternative ways to think about it.""\n\nGuillermo Tilley, the father of 7-year-old Nate, who has dyslexia, similarly would not want his son to have the fMRI.\n\n""It would taint my interpretation of who Nate is and his struggle with dyslexia,"" Tilley said.\n\nOf course, the results of the study are only preliminary. Participants included 25 children with dyslexia and 20 children without dyslexia, which is too small a sample size to prove anything, although still respectable when it comes to neuroimaging studies. Another important limitation in the study is that some children in the study did receive tutoring or reading interventions, to which they were not randomly assigned. A larger trial that controlled for remediations would offer more conclusive results. But this one found that receiving a remediation did not appear to affect improvement in reading abilities.\n\nHere\'s another insight about dyslexia: men with the condition may have enhanced visual-spatial abilities, according to a study in the journal Learning and Individual Differences. This was another small study -- 20 dyslexic volunteers and 21 participants without the condition -- testing how people identify shapes, navigate a virtual environment, and do other tasks involving spatial reasoning.\n\nDavis, a noted architect and writer in the Los Angeles area, believes he fits that category. He gets thrown off by pure mathematics, but he\'s good at anything involving spatial relationships and design.\n\nAnd those kinds of skills should be taken advantage of in school, said Wendy Weiner, principal of the arts-focused Conservatory Prep in Davie, Florida, and mother of a dyslexic child.\n\n""If they can create projects -- instead of drawing a picture of a room, if they can make a model of a room -- they will generally do it pretty much to scale because they can visualize things very clearly,"" she said.\n\nBecause of this, Weiner said, three-dimensional letters and numbers, perhaps made out of plastic or clay, help a dyslexic child grasp the shapes better. Holding a ""7"" upright in your hand, you\'re less likely to view it sideways as a ""V,"" she said.\n\nThe most important intervention is a direct, explicit teaching of phonics, or how symbols correspond with sounds, Branstetter said. The sooner it can be detected, the better. A child\'s personality can also factor in: Some persist despite frustration better than others. Parents should speak to their school psychologists about the best plan of action, she said.\n\nFor Abby, a breakthrough moment came at age 9: She started reading voraciously, and today reads well above the seventh-grade level. She\'d had good tutors and plenty of support from her parents, but it also took self-confidence for her to make herself read on her own, she said.\n\nAs for Davis, he\'d never heard of dyslexia until a friend brought it up when he was 34, and then went through training at a learning development center. Using computers for writing has helped him tremendously -- especially spell-check.\n\n""I know a lot of people who have trouble reading, as I did when I was a kid, are dyslexic,"" he said. ""It is an issue that certainly holds back a lot of kids, because of their inability to do certain things.""']",Better by far than the stories by Reuters and WebMD that we also reviewed.  Read and compare.,"



This story is the best of the three we reviewed about a study indicating that brain scans may help researchers understand brain structure and function in people who have dyslexia. It refrains from claiming that the work has near-term clinical implications for people who have trouble reading and writing. However, the bulk of the story is made up of personal stories about living with dyslexia, while key features of this research are buried deep in the story or left out entirely. What’s more, the story describes the study participants as “children,” thus leaving readers with the impression that researchers looked at beginning readers, when they actually were studying teenagers who presumably had been dealing with dyslexia for many years. In addition, the story tosses in a discussion of an unrelated study of dyslexia and spatial skills. Even people with advanced reading skills are likely to come away from this story befuddled about the scope, findings and implications of the research.

The 539 men completing the two studies, who were randomly assigned to the real drug or the fake version, had an average time of less than 36 seconds before they took part in the research. That meant the drug was linked to a 5.5-fold increase in time before ejaculation, compared to a 1.6-fold gain for the placebo.\n\nThe increase is ""clinically significant,"" says Tom Lue, a professor of urology at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn\'t involved in the research. ""People will be much happier.""\n\nThe primary findings of both trials had previously been made public, but researchers combined them and added new data in abstracts set to be presented Tuesday at the American Urological Association\'s annual meeting in San Francisco. The studies lasted three months, but researchers allowed participants to choose to continue with the drug. Its effectiveness apparently didn\'t diminish over a span as long as nine additional months.\n\nMen who used the spray rated their sexual experiences significantly higher on measures of control and satisfaction, and reported less distress than those who got placebo, according to the researchers.\n\nThe spray, currently referred to as PSD502, hasn\'t won regulatory approval to be marketed. The company that owns rights to the product, Japan\'s Shionogi & Co. Ltd., says it hopes to apply to the Food and Drug Administration and is already in discussions with the agency.\n\nDoctors are not sure what causes men to have the problem, which may involve an abnormality of the central nervous system or extreme nerve sensitivity in the penis that leads ejaculation to be triggered. Psychological factors may also play a role.\n\nTreatment for premature ejaculation has long been seen as a potentially lucrative opportunity for drug makers, which found major success with drugs for erectile dysfunction, a condition that was also once considered taboo for public discussion. Surveys have suggested that as many as 20% to 30% of men may suffer from premature ejaculation, though these figures are often drawn from broadly worded survey questions and may overstate the number of men with significant problems.\n\nThe field suffered a setback in 2005, when the FDA rejected an application from Johnson & Johnson to market a drug called Priligy; the agency doesn\'t typically reveal its reasons for such decisions publicly. To date no treatment has won the FDA\'s nod for use in premature ejaculation. The J&J drug, which works similarly to antidepressants such as Prozac, has been approved for use in 12 countries, including Germany and South Korea. A company spokeswoman says Johnson & Johnson is ""evaluating its path forward in the U.S."" for Priligy.\n\nIn the U.S., men can try certain antidepressants or numbing creams, which aren\'t FDA-approved for premature ejaculation, or work with a sex therapist or psychologist. These are ""less-than-perfect alternatives,"" says Anthony Smith, a urologist at the University of New Mexico who was not involved in the research on PSD502.\n\nThe spray may work by damping excessive sensitivity, says Ira Sharlip, a clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco who was involved in the PSD502 research. It is sprayed on the tip of the penis five minutes before sex. In the studies, men and their partners were given stopwatches to time the length of their intercourse.\n\nDr. Sharlip says the spray doesn\'t generally lead to numbness, a problem men might fear from a product involving lidocaine, which many associate with killing the pain of dental procedures. Prilocaine is also sometimes used as a numbing agent in dentistry. About 6.9% of the men reported side effects, with the most common being loss of erection, seen in 3%, or at least some loss of sensation, in 1.7%. Also, 0.6% of the men\'s female partners reported at least some loss of sensation. In all cases, the issues were temporary, the researchers said.\n\nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com']","A reasonable job of reporting on two small studies of a spray used to delay ejaculation.

But this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts, so it\'s not used in public spaces.\n\nHowever, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option.\n\nIn prior studies, they found that far-UVC light killed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria -- a common and dangerous ""superbug"" -- without harming human or mouse skin.\n\nIn this new study, they found that far-UVC light also killed airborne H1N1 virus, a common strain of flu virus.\n\n""Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it\'s not a human health hazard,"" said Brenner, who directs Columbia\'s Center for Radiological Research.\n\nHowever, ""because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach their DNA and kill them,"" he said in a university news release.\n\nLamps with this type of UV light currently cost less than $1,000, Brenner said, but that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass-produced.\n\n""And unlike flu vaccines, far-UVC is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, even newly emerging strains,"" he said.\n\nTwo flu experts were encouraged by the findings.\n\n""The prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using far-UV radiation is very exciting,"" said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.\n\n""Though hand-washing remains critically important, it does not prevent every instance of transmission,"" Grosso said. ""Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations. It appears that low-dose far-UV light is safe and effective, and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease-causing viruses.""\n\nDr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed.\n\nHe noted that the technology\'s cost ""is not prohibitive, and it is safe. This use can sterilize the air in a public space, reducing the spread of respiratory droplets containing flu viruses and other bacteria and viruses.""\n\nThe findings were published online Feb. 9 in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on flu.']","The story used speculative language from the start (“powerful” new disinfectant,” “easily kills”) and had a startling lack of information about the study.","A scene from the promotional video Columbia University produced about the study.
Full-spectrum ultraviolet C light (UVC) is already used to sterilize things like drinking water and surgical equipment. However, extended exposure can cause skin cancer and cataracts.
The news story reports a narrower spectrum, far-UVC light, was successful in killing a strain of flu virus and might have potential as a disinfectant. Previous studies by the same authors are cited that suggest this can be accomplished without the skin and eye damage seen with full spectrum UVC light.
This story does not mention that this test was conducted in a very small test chamber (not a room), and it’s unclear whether these results could be applied in “indoor public places” as the story implies.
More worrisome, the piece used speculative language from the start (“powerful” new disinfectant,” “easily kills”) and had a startling lack of information about the study. But, to its credit, this article mentioned the importance of preventive measures when it comes to the flu–something the TIME Health story (we also reviewed) lacked.

But it takes no position on MRI imaging for women who have had breast cancer, saying there is not enough evidence to recommend one way or the other.\n\nStudying the effectiveness of MRI screening on all three groups of women, Dr. Wendy DeMartini, an assistant professor of radiology at the University of Washington Medical School, said MRI imaging found proportionally more cancers in women who had been treated for breast cancer than in the women considered at very high risk.\n\n""Women in the personal history group [who had MRI] were also less likely to be recalled for additional testing, and less likely to have a biopsy for a false positive finding,"" she said.\n\nDeMartini was scheduled to present the findings Sunday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago.\n\nFor the study, her team reviewed initial breast MRI exams of 1,026 women, conducted from January 2004 to June 2009. Of these, 327 had a genetic or family history; 646 had a personal history of breast cancer that had been treated.\n\nOverall, the MRI detected 25 of 27 cancers, DeMartini said. With the MRI screen, ""we found cancer in just over 3 percent of women [with a personal history], which was double [that found in those with a genetic or family history],"" she said.\n\nHowever, still more research is needed to clarify the role of MRI in this population, she said.\n\n""The findings are impressive,"" said Dr. Robert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society. While the society recommends neither for nor against MRI imaging for those with a personal history of breast cancer, he said it regularly reviews study findings to determine if the guidelines need updating.\n\n""There are some tumors that don\'t show up on mammography as well as they do on MRI,"" he explained. MRI highlights angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, especially those that feed cancerous tissues.\n\nUntil more research is in, what should a woman with a personal history of breast cancer do?\n\n""She should talk to her doctor,"" Smith said. He doesn\'t see a downside to getting an MRI, except perhaps an increased risk of false positives and perhaps a need to pay out of pocket.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about breast cancer screening, visit the American Cancer Society.']","<span style=""font-size: larger;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">There are gaping holes in this story about a study of MRI in women who have had breast cancer.</span></span>","



The story says the study indicates benefits of annual MRI testing, but the study looked at just one-time imaging, not annual scans. Does adding MRI to conventional mammography improve survival? This study can’t answer that question. It didn’t include any data to compare MRI to mammography and it didn’t measure survival. It refers to women with a history of breast cancer without addressing questions about whether the women in this study actually represent typical cases. It brushes off concerns about costs, false positive results and other potential harms of such additional imaging tests. It neglects to report that the senior researcher is a consultant to a company that manufactures MRI scanners. It doesn’t explain what makes this particular study on MRI for breast cancer noteworthy in comparison to all the other studies that have been done recently.

However, food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children\'s behavior, though the evidence isn\'t yet conclusive.\n\nSince some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods -- such as eczema, asthma and gastrointestinal problems -- that affect different organ systems, it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior, according to information in the study.\n\nTo test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The children were between the ages of 4 and 8, and all had been diagnosed with ADHD. Most of the children were boys.\n\nThe children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet, and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating.\n\nThe restrictive diet began with a diet called the ""few foods diet,"" which includes just rice, meat, vegetables, pears and water. The researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods, such as potatoes, fruits and wheat. The restrictive diet lasted for five weeks.\n\nDuring the next four weeks, kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets, in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods.\n\nIgG is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities; however, IgG testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths, according to background information in the study.\n\nSome complementary medicine practices test for IgG and recommend eliminating foods high in IgG, explained Dr. Jaswinder Ghuman, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal.\n\nForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet. Of those, 78 percent had a reduction in their ADHD symptoms, compared with no improvement in the controls. Nine children (22 percent) didn\'t respond to the diet. On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.\n\nThirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. What\'s more, it didn\'t appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low- or high-IgG food.\n\n""Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn\'t seem helpful,"" Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.\n\n""If parents have noticed that a child\'s behavior seems to get worse with certain foods, it may be worth considering,"" said Ghuman, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\n""But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition. It should be done under the supervision of a primary care doctor, and if possible, a dietician,"" she advised.\n\nGhuman said that this study doesn\'t answer a number of questions, such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long-term. And, she added, that clinical practice shouldn\'t be changed based on the results of one study.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children\'s Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, echoed Ghuman\'s concerns.\n\n""Since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks, it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit,"" he said, adding, ""Since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children, this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with ADHD.""\n\nAdesman also pointed out that this study is only applicable to children with ADHD, not to children who had ADD without the hyperactivity component.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about ADHD from the National Institute of Mental Health.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story fell short on enough of our marks to give it an average score but, in comparison to its <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3593"" target=""_blank"">WebMD competitor</a> on this particular topic, it excelled.</span>","This story presented a more cautious view than the WebMD story we reviewed on a study suggesting that a restrictive diet may help ease the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It did a nice job avoiding disease mongering, evaluating the quality of the evidence, describing the benefits in both relative and absolute terms and making good use of independent experts. It also does a better job describing the diet itself and explaining the IgG antibody component of the research.

At the fourth month mark, “the gap was huge” between the texting and control groups, she told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nTexting also played a role in helping patients feel like they were in control of their treatment, particularly during the first month.\n\nTexting did not affect the odds of developing symptoms of depression.\n\nSurprisingly, the older the patient, the greater the likelihood that she would text back, seeking more information.\n\nOne of the patients texted the program 1,217 times. “That’s what’s good about this program.

The latest study comes down in favor of virtue: It says that drinking coffee, whether regular or decaf, could reduce the risk of death.\n\nResearchers started with data from surveys of adults in the United States that asked how much coffee they consumed, as well as other foods and drinks, and then they looked at their rates of death and disease over the following two decades.\n\nThe study was large, including more than 200,000 women and 50,000 men.\n\nAt first, researchers did not see an obvious relationship between coffee consumption and death rates. Study participants who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 5% to 9% lower risk of dying than those who drank no coffee. Those who drank more than three cups a day did not see any benefit. The finding was murky, like previous studies, some of which suggested a benefit and some did not.\n\nBut when the researchers looked at coffee consumption only among people who said they never smoked, the relationship became clearer: Those who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 6% to 8% lower risk of dying than noncoffee drinkers. Those who drank three to five cups and more than five cups had 15% and 12% lower death rates.\n\nRead More']",An over-the-top headline and lack of absolute numbers limit the value of an otherwise worthy and responsible discussion of this new coffee study.,"This CNN story describes yet another observational study of the possible links between coffee consumption and health, this one concluding that overall, whether decaf or regular, coffee drinking is linked to reduced risk of death from heart disease, diabetes, and neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, although not cancer. The headline — “Coffee could literally be a lifesaver” — is overblown given the types of evidence we’re talking about. But the story otherwise does a worthy and responsible job of framing the study’s weaknesses and strengths, particularly so in explaining confounding factors and why so many coffee studies historically have yielded “murky” results. It also takes a pretty good stab at exploring the study’s suggestion that natural chemicals in the coffee may be responsible for the beverage’s potential health benefits, an effort that was essentially missing from a story in STAT that was otherwise much stronger in describing the strengths and weaknesses of this and all observational studies. The CNN story also aptly noted the novel analysis of coffee drinking in a non-smoking subset of the nearly 200,000 subjects. Overall, this CNN piece could have been made stronger by having outside experts comment on the findings, as the STAT piece did to excellent effect; by offering more qualitative details about the sources of the data; by noting that in excessive quantities, the new study identified a slight increase in risk of death; and — as the STAT piece did superbly, noting the likely “benefits” in terms of absolute risk (very, very small).

""They then looked at the extent to which brain activity from one region was synchronized with brain activity from another region,"" a phenomenon known as ""EEG coherence,"" said Dawson, who was not involved in the research.\n\n""Synchronization between different brain regions indicates that those regions are functioning in a coordinated, rather than independent, fashion -- in other words, they are functionally connected and communicating with each other,"" she said.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Frank Duffy and Dr. Heidelise Als compared EEG measurements of nearly 1,000 children with and without autism. They found that the two groups had widespread differences in terms of brain connectivity.\n\nEEG revealed that the children with autism had a reduced short range connectivity, indicating poor function of local brain networks. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language.\n\nThe children with autism also had increased connectivity between brain regions that were farther apart, which might be a mechanism developed to compensate for reduced short range connectivity, the researchers said.\n\nThe research was conducted at Boston Children\'s Hospital and was published online June 25 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nThe use of EEG-based testing may help diagnose autism in children and may improve early detection in infants, leading to more effective treatments and coping strategies, the researchers said.\n\n""What was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied,"" Dawson noted. ""Consistent with many previous studies using EEG and functional MRI with both children and adults with autism, these investigators found that, overall, children with autism show reduced coordination (coherence) across brain regions.""\n\nShe said the findings are important because, ""they help us understand why individuals with autism have difficulty with complex behaviors, such as social interaction and language. As children\'s brains develop, the different brain regions become increasingly connected, allowing for the acquisition of complex behaviors that require coordination across different brain regions.""\n\nLanguage, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said.\n\n""This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism,"" she added. ""The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children.""\n\nAnother expert agreed.\n\n""Although autism is still principally a clinical diagnosis, this study ... may allow for a new approach to classifying children with autism and may even assist in the early identification of affected children at a younger age,"" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children\'s Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, NY.\n\nThe number of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has recently increased to one in 88.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about autism.']",Over reliance on a source from an advocacy organization leaves readers confused as to whether this study will make a difference.

In contrast, a concussion survey commonly used by doctors was right less than 70 percent of the time.\n\nIf the experimental test pans out, ""a pediatrician could collect saliva with a swab, send it off to the lab and then be able to call the family the next day,"" says Steven Hicks, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State Hershey. Hicks helped develop the test and consults for a company that hopes to market concussion tests.\n\nA reliable test would help overcome a major obstacle in assessing and treating concussions, which affect more than one million children and adolescents in the U.S. each year. Many of the injuries are related to sports.\n\nIn most cases, concussion symptoms last only a few days. But up to 25 percent of young patients ""go on to have these prolonged headaches, fatigue, nausea, and those symptoms can last sometimes one to four months,"" Hicks says.\n\nAnd, right now, there\'s no way to know which kids are going to have long-term problems, he says.\n\n""Parents often say that their biggest concern is, \'When is my child going to be back to normal again?\' "" Hicks says. ""And that\'s something we have a very difficult time predicting.""\n\nHicks and a team of researchers have been looking for an objective test that might help.\n\nThey knew that, after a concussion, injured brain cells try to heal themselves. As a part of this process, brain cells release tiny fragments of genetic material called microRNAs. Some of these fragments eventually turn up in blood and even in saliva.\n\nThe team did an experiment that involved 50 concussion patients between the ages of 7 and 18.\n\n""When they came to our medical center and received the diagnosis of concussion, we evaluated them with some standard survey-based tools and then we also got a sample of their saliva,"" Hicks says. Most samples were collected about a week after the injury.\n\nThe team measured levels of many different microRNAs in the samples, and eventually they identified a handful that let them predict how long symptoms would last. They also identified one microRNA that predicted which children would have a specific concussion symptom: difficulties with memory and problem solving, Hicks says.\n\nA saliva test could greatly improve care for young people who don\'t have obvious symptoms of a concussion, says Manish Bhomia, an adjunct assistant professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.\n\n""A lot of children get mild concussion and oftentimes it goes ignored,"" he says.\n\nA reliable lab test would help ensure that children who have a head injury don\'t go back to school, or to the soccer field, before their brain has healed, Bhomia says.\n\nAnd microRNAs offer a promising way to assess concussions in adults as well as children, says Bhomia, whose research involves a range of ""biomarkers"" for traumatic brain injury.\n\nBut saliva may not be the best place to measure microRNAs, Bhomia says. A better option, he says, might be blood samples, which tend to contain greater numbers of the genetic fragments.']",News stories should be scrupulous about distinctions between what researchers hope to prove and what they actually tested.,"This story about a saliva test that may be able to more accurately predict how long children will feel the symptoms of a concussion confuses readers with claims that the test could improve concussion care, something the study did not look at.
We applaud the story for pointing out that the lead researcher is consulting with a company that hopes to market the test. The story also included an independent source who provided some context; however, the way those comments were reported makes it appear the test could detect brain injuries that don’t produce symptoms, when actually the study looked only at how well the test predicted the duration of symptoms.
The story also presents statistics in a way that is technically correct, but probably misleading, because it does not explain how the prevalence of a condition affects the likely meaning of test results. (Specifically, the less common a condition is, the less likely it is that a positive test result is accurate.) And as with all stories about tests, the potential harm of false positive and false negative results should have been mentioned.

Then Zzz: Tonsillectomy Helps Kids Sleep\n\ntoggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR\n\nGetting your tonsils out used to be just part of childhood — a rite of passage for children in the 1950s and \'60s. Then it fell out of favor.\n\nBut tonsillectomy is back.\n\nToday, the most common reason for the surgery is ""sleep disordered breathing,"" a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. About 10 percent of elementary-school-age children snore.\n\nDoctors say snoring can cause bed-wetting, behavior problems, short stature and poor school performance. That\'s a far cry from the 1950s and \'60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats.\n\nBack then, it was the most popular surgery in the United States. In the 1960s sitcom Leave It to Beaver, Beaver Cleaver was so impressed by his dad\'s tales of ice cream and pretty nurses that he schemed to have his tonsils out, even though he didn\'t need it.\n\nTurning Point For Tonsillectomies\n\nIt was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections. People were growing up with their tonsils.\n\nThe tonsils are two glands that sit at the base of the tongue and are part of the body\'s immune system. The premise of tonsillectomies, back in their heyday, was that tonsils get infected themselves and no longer help fend off germs.\n\nThen doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn\'t until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections.\n\n""It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections,"" says Richard Rosenfeld, an ear, nose and throat doctor at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, N.Y. ""People were growing up with their tonsils.""\n\nBut growing up with tonsils can create another problem: snoring. Lisa Moran of Takoma Park, Md., remembers what it sounded like when her son ,Tyler Scorza, now age 7, slept.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR Maggie Starbard/NPR\n\n""It was loud,"" Moran says. ""You could hear him through he closed door, down the hall, snoring, and he would occasionally stop breathing.""\n\nAt first, Tyler\'s pediatrician thought he\'d outgrow the snoring. But he wasn\'t sleeping well and often didn\'t have any energy. The doctor recommended a head X-Ray, and the radiologist said that though Tyler\'s adenoids were enlarged, they weren\'t that bad.\n\nBy then, Tyler had been dealing with this for almost three years. He started getting frequent nasal infections. So his parents took him to an ear, nose and throat doctor. He said, sure, the adenoids are swollen.\n\n""But the real problem is the tonsils!"" Moran recalls. ""He showed us on the X-ray that there was a tiny passage between the tonsils and the back of his throat — very small.""\n\nEnlarged tonsils (and adenoids) are the most common cause of sleep-disordered breathing in children. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy.\n\nComplications From Surgery\n\nBut Tyler\'s parents were worried about the surgery. It\'s usually done as an outpatient procedure now, but with general anesthesia. That\'s never without some risk.\n\n""Your child is under,"" says Moran, ""completely under. This is not a local.""\n\nOther complications include pain after surgery and the risk of bleeding; about 4 percent of people have complications that require readmission to the hospital.\n\nDespite hundreds of studies, there\'s still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial.\n\nWhat\'s A Sleep Study? Sleep studies are a way for doctors to diagnose sleep disorders like apnea by observing patients overnight while they sleep. During a sleep study, the patient is connected to an array of sensors monitoring brainwaves, eye movements, heart rate, breathing and blood-oxygen levels. This information, called a polysomnogram, lets doctors see whether the patient has stopped breathing and for how long. Apnea in adults happens when 10 seconds pass without breathing; for children, it\'s a disruption of two cycles of inhaling and exhaling. Some patients can also use portable sleep monitors to record what\'s happening in their sleep as an alternative to the sleep study, but that approach is not as comprehensive. Many sleep disorders can be diagnosed without costly sleep studies, which can run anywhere from $600 to several-thousand dollars. More children are undergoing sleep studies as awareness of the condition — particularly in children — rises. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine says about 2 percent of children have obstructive sleep apnea. Before a sleep study is ordered, doctors typically ask for medical and sleep histories and a physical exam. — Eliza Barclay\n\nNo less a personage than President Obama dissed tonsillectomy when he was stumping for health care overhaul in July 2009. In a prime time news conference, Obama said that doctors may think: "" \'You know what? I make a lot more money if I take this kid\'s tonsils out.\' ""\n\nRosenfeld disputes Obama\'s claim, saying insurers usually pay a surgeon $200 to $300 for tonsil surgery.\n\nSleep Study Before Tonsillectomy\n\nThe picture is further clouded because not all children with big tonsils have sleep-disordered breathing or frequent throat infections. Because of that, in 2002 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered.\n\nAbout 530,000 tonsillectomies are performed in the United States each year. Obviously, parents could use some help in deciding whether surgery is needed. In January, the American Academy of Otolaryngology issued its first guidelines on tonsillectomy in children.\n\nWith sore throats, the ENTs recommend waiting (and treatment with antibiotics, if needed), unless a child has more than seven infections in a year. They\'d recommend surgery if a child has five or more throat infections a year for two years, or three or more in three years.\n\nThere have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Most of the researchers have asked parents or children whether they noticed improvements, and looked at a single measure, like behavior or quality of life. Still, the ENTs recommend tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing, saying it reduces symptoms in most children.\n\nTyler\'s family decided to go ahead with the surgery; they went to the hospital at 5 a.m., and Tyler was home by noon. The doctors said he would be out of school for a week, but a throat infection kept him home a second week. His classmates sent him get-well cards.\n\nA year later, Tyler is feeling great. And his snoring is gone. ""Completely gone,"" his mom says. ""You can hear a pin-drop quiet when he sleeps.""\n\nTyler still hears snoring at night, he says. But he knows that the culprit is not him, or the family dog. It\'s Dad.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A well-written story on the interesting history of tonsil problems and changing attitudes about surgeries.  But the story does not back up the headline, which says definitively that “Tonsillectomy helps kids sleep.”</span>","The evidence is really weak on the claim made in the headline, as the story later acknowledges. We wish the story had spent a little more time on costs and quantifying benefits instead of paying so much attention to one anecdotal case where a surgery was done to alleviate snoring.
The health care system needs to continue to be critical of interventions that don’t work or are harmful.  It’s clear that we haven’t had good evidence for much of how this old procedure has been done.

Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nThe Ache: In cold and flu season, pathogens spread when people are crammed into close quarters, such as airplanes and cars.\n\nThe Claim: Personal air purifiers worn around the neck clean the air in the wearer’s breathing zone of viruses and bacteria as well as allergens, say companies that sell them.\n\nThe Verdict: The devices helped clear a variety of test particles from the air in lab tests, but scientists say there’s no proof they have any health benefit in real conditions.\n\n“It sounds like it worked in a laboratory setting, but that doesn’t say anything about whether it works in real life,” says Darryl C. Zeldin, scientific director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. Theoretically it is possible that the devices might help reduce transmission of pathogens, or ease asthma symptoms, but proof is needed, he adds.\n\nPersonal air purifiers work by emitting electrically charged molecules or atoms called ions, companies say. The ions transfer the charge to particles—such as one carrying a flu virus—in the user’s breathing zone and since like-charged particles repel each other, they are pushed out of the breathing zone, companies say.\n\nThe AirSupply Minimate from Wein Products Inc. in Los Angeles, emits positive ions and fits in the palm of the hand. The AirTamer A310, new last year from Headwaters Inc. in Marblehead, Mass., emits negative ions. It recharges through a USB port and holds the charge for 150 hours of continuous use, says company co-founder Troy Anderson. Both devices have suggested prices of $150.\n\nIn lab tests funded by Headwaters, the AirTamer was found to efficiently clear cigarette smoke, Mr. Anderson says.\n\nIn research partly funded by the company, Wein’s technology has undergone a battery of testing by University of Cincinnati scientists. In a study, published in the journal Indoor Air in 2005, a prototype of the Minimate was tested for removal of particles, including salt particles in a variety of sizes and a bacterium that doesn’t usually cause disease. It cleared the air of half of the test particles after 15 minutes, and nearly all of them within 90 minutes, according to the results.\n\nThe particles remain present on surfaces, “but at least you reduce inhalation exposure,” says study author Sergey A. Grinshpun, a professor of environmental health at the university. Since the particles used in the test were similar to the size of bacteria and particles carrying infectious viruses, it wasn’t necessary to use infectious particles in the test, he adds.\n\nDr. Grinshpun’s study appears nicely done, but doesn’t reflect real-life conditions, says Werner E. Bischoff, an infectious-disease specialist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. In the lab tests, the particles are introduced only once and the purifier is given time to clear them, he adds, but “if you sit next to a person in an airplane, this person will sneeze and cough during the entire eight-hour flight.”\n\nENLARGE AirSupply Minimate emits positive ions and fits in the palm of the hand. Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nColds and flus are transmitted not just by air, but also by people touching surfaces, Dr. Bischoff adds. It’s always a good idea to avoid touching your nose or mouth after touching the back of an airline seat.\n\nThe Cincinnati researchers also found the Minimate prototype reduced the concentration of “viable” airborne bacteria, defined as bacteria that grow well on a petri dish, Dr. Grinshpun says. It isn’t known exactly what causes the inactivation of bacteria, he says.\n\nHeadwaters’s Mr. Anderson and Stanley Weinberg, CEO and chairman of Wein, both say that while it’s difficult to test the devices for real-world benefits, customer feedback has been positive.\n\nScientists caution that the antibacterial effect could be caused by a gaseous byproduct of the device, such as ozone, an air pollutant. Both Messrs. Anderson and Weinberg say their devices produce negligible amounts of ozone. Mr. Weinberg adds that the Minimate has also tested negative for hydrogen-peroxide emission.\n\nIn 2006, a personal air purifier exploded on a Continental Airlines flight, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. According to the report, the problem was probably caused by the user recharging a non-rechargeable battery; there were no serious injuries. The device, called the Fresh Air Buddy and formerly manufactured by Wein for another company, is no longer made, says Mr. Weinberg.\n\nWhether you’re allowed to take an air purifier on an airplane depends on the carrier. United Airlines, which now owns Continental, doesn’t allow the air purifiers in the cabin based on the results of an “internal review,” a spokeswoman says. There is no Federal Aviation Administration restriction on carrying personal air purifiers on board, but each airline can make its own call, an FAA spokeswoman says.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com']",This is another quality installment of health news from the Wall Street Journal’s “Aches and Claims” column — this time on the dubious benefits of personal air purifiers. Check out ,"This story asks whether personal air purifiers provide some protection from pathogen-caused illnesses and mentions lab tests that suggest some efficacy in avoiding inhalation of small particles. It also explains the limitations of these lab studies, and notes that there is little evidence to support claims of actual health benefits associated with these devices.

It cites no real evidence, and never acknowledges that procedure has a low success rate and carries potential for harm.","This short article tells a compelling story of a life saved because of bystander CPR, and uses a gathering of such survivors and their saviors to encourage others to learn CPR. It makes an emotional pitch for the value of CPR by non-medical personnel, and leaves readers with the clear implication that CPR is an emergency measure with a proven, high success rate, even in the hands of amateurs. And therein is the problem. CPR does save lives, but at a rate many experts acknowledge is astonishingly low, even when performed by EMTs, physicians, and nurses in hospital settings. It’s hard to fault a story that may prompt  “civilians” to get potentially life-saving CPR training, but readers would have been much better served to also hear about the substantial downsides to CPR,  urgent need for public support of further CPR research, and alternatives to current CPR resuscitation efforts, such as the out-of-hospital use of automated external defibrillators, also known as AEDs.

That number has risen in recent years, but it’s unclear whether that’s due to more kids with symptoms or doctors who are more likely to recognize and diagnose autism.\n\nThe new study, which appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association, doesn’t prove low folic acid in pregnant women causes their babies to develop autism, or that high doses can prevent it. And Suren and his colleagues didn’t see an effect of folic acid on other autism spectrum disorders, such as Asperger’s.\n\nThey followed just over 85,000 women and their children, born between 2002 and 2008.\n\nWhen women were about halfway through their pregnancies, they reported on any supplements or vitamins they’d taken in the few weeks before becoming pregnant and the two months afterward - the time when folic acid is thought to have the strongest effect on development.\n\nBy the time their kids were between three and 10 years old, 270 had been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, including 114 with autism itself.\n\nSuren’s team found one in 1,000 babies born to women who reported taking folic acid early in pregnancy had autism, compared to about two in 1,000 of those whose moms didn’t take folic acid. On the other hand, there was no link between fish oil taken during pregnancy and autism risk.\n\nThat suggests it’s something about folic acid, in particular, that influences a baby’s autism risk.\n\n“The biggest problem we have is, how do you know it’s folic acid and not just a more health-conscious mother?” said Cathrine Hoyo, who has studied folic acid supplementation at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n“Doing that (analysis) really added another layer toward convincing us that there is something to it,” Hoyo, who wasn’t involved in the new research, told Reuters Health.\n\nBEFORE PREGNANCY, TOO\n\nResearchers said folic acid’s effects on genes and DNA repair could explain its role in brain development disorders in growing babies, including autism.\n\nThe USPSTF recommends all women who are planning to or could become pregnant take between 400 and 800 micrograms of the vitamin daily. The U.S. and Canada have also required flour to be fortified with folic acid since the late 1990s to cut down on birth defect risks.\n\nStill, “The message for folic acid before pregnancy has been a little bit lost,” said Rebecca Schmidt, who has studied prenatal vitamins and autism at the University of California, Davis.\n\n“If you are not even just planning a pregnancy, but able to get pregnant, then you should be taking some sort of folic acid supplement,” she told Reuters Health.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/JjFzqx Journal of the American Medical Association, online February 12, 2013.']",This story about possible links between folic acid supplements and reduced autism risk tries to include enough caveats to put the study results in the proper perspective.

Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n“Taking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,” she said in a telephone interview.\n\nPoor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\nTo investigate, Zheng’s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year.\n\nOver the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person’s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.\n\nWhile the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn’t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.\n\nShe recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.\n\n“This study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,” said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the research.\n\n“If you’re aging without good vision, not only are you giving your brain less stimulation, you might be altering your brain at a structural level,” she said in a phone interview.\n\nThe good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable. Even incurable causes of age-related vision loss such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration “are highly treatable, so we can reduce the amount of vision loss that people suffer from if they’re detected early.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2KNE36Y and bit.ly/2KKPqfN JAMA Ophthalmology, online June 28, 2018.']",How strong is the link between vision and cognition?  The story doesn’t say.,"Scientists have established a relationship between clearness of vision and cognitive function in older individuals; they seem to rise or fall together.  But does one cause the other?  In an attempt to answer that question, a trio of researchers introduced time into the analysis, exploring the relationship between clarity of vision at time 1 and cognitive function at time 2, and vice versa, repeatedly over an 8-year period.  The study does find a relationship but, given the large number of participants in the study (more than 2500), it is a modest one.  Alas, that does not deter either sources in the story or the headline writer, who opt into causal statements that are far stronger than the data warrant.

The surgery necessary to allow deep brain stimulation is extremely expensive. And for now, the research is preliminary, so it\'s too early to know for sure if the treatment is appropriate to be used for any kind of depression.\n\nStill, the study suggests that brain stimulation ""not only just helps patients who haven\'t been able to recover from depression, but it seems to be associated with the absence of relapses. They\'re not only getting better, they\'re staying better,"" said study co-author Dr. Helen Mayberg, a professor in both the departments of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and neurology, at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n\nIn deep brain stimulation, surgeons insert wires into the brain that allows a specific region to be continuously hit with an electronic pulse. The level of stimulation is controlled by a pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest.\n\nDeep brain stimulation has been around for more than 20 years, Mayberg said, and is commonly used to treat Parkinson\'s disease. The cost of the surgery is about $50,000, she said.\n\nPrevious research by Mayberg and others suggested that deep brain stimulation had potential as a treatment for depression. The St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation company, which has provided consulting fees to Mayberg and some of the other study authors, is currently recruiting patients for a study that could pave the way for its approval as a treatment for depression, Mayberg said.\n\nThe new study, which appears online Jan. 2 in the Archives of General Psychiatry, began with 10 patients with depression and seven with bipolar disorder -- a condition that causes severe mood swings and is also known as manic depression. They all received deep brain stimulation for 24 weeks after going through four weeks either with or without stimulation.\n\nMost of the patients continued to receive the treatment over two years, although researchers temporarily turned it off in three of them as part of the study before realizing that doing so caused their depression to return.\n\nThe researchers found that 18 percent of patients went into remission after 24 weeks, 36 percent (of 14 patients) after one year. After two years, of the 12 patients still in the study, seven patients (58 percent) were in remission.\n\n""The number of patients who got better increased over time, but it\'s not quite clear as to why,"" Mayberg said. The workings of deep brain stimulation as a whole are a mystery, although Mayberg said it may work by changing the brain\'s rhythms.\n\nPatients didn\'t suffer from side effects, she noted.\n\nSo, what\'s next?\n\nDr. Samuel James Collier, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Austin, predicted that even if deep brain stimulation turns out to be an effective treatment for depression, it\'ll be far from the first line of defense.\n\n""Medications and ECT -- electroconvulsive therapy -- are clearly safer, better tolerated, and do not embody a large surgical risk,"" Collier said. ""I can\'t think of a scenario where deep brain stimulation would be considered even remotely before medications and ECT were exhausted.""\n\nStill, he said, it\'s important to note that ""we seem to be making progress and hopefully those who are suffering the most can find solace in that and not give up hope.""\n\nFor now, research continues. If patients are interested in deep brain stimulation treatment, they should try to get into the study that\'s ongoing, Mayberg said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about deep brain stimulation, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']",Strong point:  caveats up high in the story.  Weaker points: confusing presentation of data.,"This solid story on a very small study of deep brain stimulation gives readers a lot of the information they need, but it also likely will lead to some confusion about what the study found.

He\'s a professor of medicine and director of Vanderbilt University\'s heart clinical research program in Nashville.\n\nPeople with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. These include medications to lower blood pressure and diuretics to help remove excess fluid that builds up as a result of the heart\'s labored pumping ability. In addition, some people have implanted defibrillators or pacemakers.\n\nEven with all these options, the death rate among these patients is ""unacceptably high,"" Lenihan said.\n\nHeart failure, a condition where the heart can\'t pump enough blood to meet the body\'s needs, is among the leading causes of death worldwide. A significant number of heart failure patients don\'t respond well to current treatments, particularly those patients whose left lower heart chamber, which pumps blood into the arteries, is weak, Lenihan said.\n\nCimaglermin acts as a growth factor for the heart, helping it repair itself following injury, Lenihan said. Specifically, it binds to the HER2 and HER4 receptors on the surface of heart cells that are important for cellular repair and survival, he explained.\n\nResearchers have tried using stem cells to repair heart muscle in much the same way, he said, but these efforts have not been effective. ""You don\'t see any sustained effect,"" he added.\n\nA phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said.\n\n""This drug, although still in an experimental phase, might be an important way to improve heart function in patients with heart failure,"" he said.\n\nFor the study, Lenihan and his colleagues randomly assigned 40 patients to get an infusion of cimaglermin or a placebo.\n\nCompared with patients who received a placebo, patients given a high dose of cimaglermin had a sustained increase in the heart\'s ability to pump blood. The improvement lasted 90 days, with the maximum increase in heart function reached in 28 days, the researchers found.\n\nThe most common side effects were headache and nausea directly after receiving the drug. One patient who received the highest dose of cimaglermin developed abnormal liver function, which cleared up over a two-week period, Lenihan said.\n\nThe study was funded by Acorda Therapeutics, the maker of cimaglermin, and the report was published online Dec. 26 in the journal JACC: Basic to Translational Science.\n\nDr. Nanette Bishopric is a professor of medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the author of an accompanying journal editorial. ""There haven\'t been breakthrough treatments for heart failure for a long time,"" she said.\n\nCimaglermin, however, may be such a drug, she said. ""It\'s a remarkable thing that you could give a drug once and have it affect heart function three months later -- it\'s really extraordinary,"" she said.\n\nEvery drug currently used to treat heart failure has to be given daily or several times a day to get it to work, Bishopric said. ""And when you stop taking it, it stops working,"" she said.\n\nDespite the encouraging results of this first trial, a lot more testing will be needed before cimaglermin can be considered a standard treatment for heart failure, Bishopric said.\n\n""These findings need to be replicated in larger trials, and you have to be able to predict whether improved heart function from cimaglermin will help people live longer and feel better,"" she noted.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on heart failure, visit the American Heart Association.']",The story would have been stronger if it had detailed exactly what the researchers were measuring when they concluded the drug worked better than placebo.,"This HealthDay story reports on the very early results of a phase one trial of a drug, cimaglermin, intended to improve the left ventricular function among patients with a type of heart failure known as “severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.”

They’re poked and prodded and scoped in an effort to figure out what’s complicating conception.\n\nWhile it’s just as likely that infertility is related to the male half of the couple, only 20% of men in duos struggling to make a baby get a sperm-count analysis early on or at all, according to data from SpermCheck Fertility, which earlier this month announced the availability of its at-home screening test for men. SpermCheck, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, assesses sperm count with 98% accuracy in 10 minutes and does away with the unpleasantness of conjuring up a sperm sample in a doctor’s office. As SpermCheck’s website puts it, a “trip to a fertility clinic for a semen analysis is not for everyone. These tests can be expensive (costing hundreds of dollars and not typically covered by insurance), inconvenient and are often embarrassing.”\n\nMORE: ‘Sonicated’ Sperm: Could Ultrasound Be the Next Male Contraceptive?\n\nLow sperm count, or oligospermia, is a main cause of male infertility. By addressing the issue, SpermCheck will join a crowded infertility market that includes more than 20 types of female-fertility tests in Walgreen stores alone. For women who are having trouble getting pregnant, the test may very well be one they — and not their squeamish partners — snap up along with over-the-counter ovulation kits.\n\n“In our society, the woman carries the burden of trying to determine the issues surrounding infertility,” Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, told Bloomberg News. “Men don’t say, ‘Let me go to the urologist and give a semen sample.’” That reluctance has created a $440 million-a-year market for male fertility tests in the U.S., Lopez says.\n\nThe test reveals whether sperm count appears normal, at 20 million or more sperm per ml; lower than that indicates a trip to the doctor is pretty much unavoidable. Stores will begin stocking the $39.99 test in April; until then, men — or their partners — can find it online at www.Walgreens.com and www.CVS.com.\n\nMORE: The Sperm Bike: Cycling to Drum Up Sperm Donations\n\nIt relies on scrutiny of a particular protein found only in the head of mature sperm; the protein was discovered by John Herr, director of the Center of Cell Biology at the University of Virginia and the chairman of SpermCheck. “This at-home test was created to meet the needs of couples who are considering and just planning on starting a family, those currently having trouble conceiving,” says Herr, and “even those men who are just curious about their sperm count.”\n\nWould-be virile men “just curious” about their sperm count? Hard to believe. And yet, assuming fertility aids of some sort successfully pave the way to parenthood, SpermCheck could also prove of some use at the other end of the spectrum: the company also manufactures a do-it-yourself test for postvasectomy screening.\n\nMORE: How Better Habits Can Make Your Day\n\nMORE: Could a Healthy Diet Boost Sperm?']","A story that read like an ad, appeared to draw big chunks from a company news release, and didn’t give men the whole picture they need to evaluate a new test.","The story could have helped men read between the lines of the company’s touting of the debut of this “first at-home test.”

Reich for USA TODAY Scar marks the spot: ""My leg is already stronger than it was a year ago,"" says Torres. CARTILAGE AS CUSHION CARTILAGE AS CUSHION Articular cartilage is located at bone endings, providing a cushion and preventing bone from connecting with other bone. Why cartilage doesn\'t heal on its own: It has limited ability to repair itself because it doesn\'t have a blood supply. Why it hurts: When cartilage is damaged or worn down, bone hits bone where the sensitive nerve endings are located. Is ACI for you? Patience White, public health officer of the Arthritis Foundation, says cartilage regeneration isn\'t for everyone, especially not for obese people. ""I think it has tremendous potential,"" she says. ""But we don\'t know all the answers yet."" She recommends strengthening the muscles around the joint, losing weight and being sure you\'re ready for the exercise you want to do. THE PROCEDURE, AND THE PEOPLE IT MIGHT HELP THE PROCEDURE, AND THE PEOPLE IT MIGHT HELP People who need knee replacements can scratch this cartilage repair surgery off their list, says Riley Williams, a surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. ""If you have one, maybe two areas of isolated cartilage loss, then you are a candidate,"" says Williams. ""If you have it on one side of the knee, the meniscus is gone, and clearly the environment of the knee has shifted toward the degenerative, then we can\'t help with this kind of surgery."" ACI is a two-step process: Step 1: Healthy cartilage cells are taken from the knee using an arthroscopic tube. The cells are sent to a lab where they are cultured and multiply in about four to six weeks. Step 2: This requires a larger incision. A layer of tissue is sewn over the damaged area. The new cells are injected under the patch, where they will regenerate cartilage with surrounding cartilage. Dara Torres says life was ""kind of depressing"" — and she is not one to be depressed. A year ago, the Olympic swimmer could not walk up stairs without limping or pick up her baby girl because her knee hurt so much. Now, after undergoing a highly specialized surgery, Torres is picking up her toddler and her training for the 2012 London Olympics. She became the first U.S. swimmer to compete in five Olympics, winning three silver medals at the 2008 Beijing Games at age 41. ""When you train like this at my age, it takes its toll on your body,"" she says. Before Beijing, she had left knee pain, and afterward, it got much worse. A series of X-rays taken during several months revealed quickly deteriorating cartilage. ""My doctor told me it was one of the worst knees he\'s ever seen."" She opted to delay knee replacement and instead had orthopedic surgeon Thomas Minas perform knee cartilage regeneration surgery on Oct. 20. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) requires two operations, followed by a lengthy recovery and physical therapy. Torres says it\'s the toughest rehab she has ever faced, but ""I was diligent about listening to the doctor (and) pacing myself."" For 12 to 18 months, the new cartilage cells need to heal and harden. Patients wear a leg brace and use crutches for several months. They can run after a year and pivot several months later. Exertion or twisting too early could cause irreversible damage. Torres\' knee ""was a mess,"" Minas says. ""Now she walks normally, climbs stairs and has no pain."" Minas, director of the Cartilage Repair Center at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Chestnut Hill, Mass., performed the first ACIs in the USA in 1995 and has done more than 600. He says his patients, average age 39, have had a 92% success rate. ""This will delay a small group of patients who need knee replacements,"" he says. ""But we will always need replacements, unless we find some ... breakthrough halting the progression of osteoarthritis."" Torres says she is on track for London and just started ""easing back into kicking."" She hopes to keep motivating others to pursue dreams, no matter what age: ""I hear people say what I\'m doing inspires them to do things they put off because of age or thought they couldn\'t do.""

"," Anecdote and expert opinion triumphed over science and good journalism in a story on the regeneration of knee cartilage in USA Today. 
The article focused on autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), an expensive procedure intended to regenerate articular cartilage in the knee involving two operations and an arduous 18-month rehabilitation process.
Unwarranted Assumption of Benefit
From start to finish, the article seemed to assume that ACI is a beneficial treatment. It examined the outcomes of ACI through the prism of a single patient, who is apparently making a good recovery 12 months after the procedure.
That the journalist chose to present the experiences of a celebrity—Olympic swimmer Dara Torres—only adds to the allure of this invasive therapy. But it is certainly open to question whether the experiences of a highly disciplined Olympic athlete are generalizable to other patients undergoing this treatment.
The article offered a misleading statistic from Torres’ surgeon, who stated that 92% of his more than 600 patients have had “success” with ACI.
Yet the USA Today story never defined the indications for surgery in these patients— or what “success” meant.
No Mention of Scientific Evidence
In an era of evidence-based journalism, the article went astray in never citing a single scientific study or attempting to quantify the expected benefit of ACI.
It didn’t specify the availability or costs (an estimated $20-$35K) of this procedure. It didn’t address specific treatment alternatives for cartilage damage.
It didn’t discuss the possibility of adverse effects related to ACI. Yet in some studies, up to 50% of patients who opted for ACI have had to undergo an additional surgical procedure for cartilage problems down the road. (Genzyme, Highlights of Prescribing Information, Genzyme.com)
Two outside experts did offer some tempering remarks but didn’t actually question the effectiveness of ACI. And like the other contributors to this article, they didn’t cite a single scientific study.
What Does the Scientific Evidence Say?
A few sentences on the scientific evidence base for ACI would have brought the entire article into focus—and provided a real benefit for individuals considering this procedure.
And what does that evidence show? The most recent systematic review found evidence that ACI can provide benefit over the short-to-intermediate term. So its long-term effectiveness hasn’t been established. (Harris JD et al., AACI: Systematic Review, JBJS, Sept 15, 2010)
It is not clear if ACI is superior to many other common treatments for pain and dysfunction related to articular cartilage damage. Well-designed randomized trials comparing ACI to usual care would be valuable. 
So in short, while the evidence on ACI is promising, the jury is still out. This observation should have been the starting point for the USA Today article.

Though the findings are correlational, walnuts are uniquely high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which may be of particular value in Type 2 diabetes prevention.\n\nThe scientists, writing in the April issue of The Journal of Nutrition, used dietary and health data on 138,000 women participating in a large continuing study of women’s health. Beginning in 1999 they collected data on walnut consumption, and followed the women for the next 10 years. They found 5,930 cases of Type 2 diabetes.\n\nWomen who ate walnuts tended to weigh less, consume more fish and exercise more than those who did not. But researchers controlled for these and many other factors, and found that compared with women who ate no walnuts, those who consumed 8 ounces of walnuts or more a month reduced their risk for Type 2 diabetes by 24 percent.\n\n“There’s been a lot of research on nuts in general in relation to cardiovascular health,” said the senior author, Dr. Frank B. Hu, a professor of medicine at Harvard. “This is the first on walnuts and diabetes. Walnuts may have some unique benefits.”\n\nThe study was supported with grants from the National Institutes of Health and the California Walnut Commission.']","Even large observational studies have inherent limitations, but this story barely cracked the shell on this topic.","It’s probably not the writer’s choice to submit such a short piece devoid of some of the context he could have provided.  We don’t know why the New York Times continues to post such mini-briefs on complicated health/medical/science topics, but we don’t think it’s in the public interest.  And when you read some of the comments left on the Times‘ website following this story, you’ll see that we’re not the only ones who feel this way.

It\'s being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states.\n\n""I put it on my phone yesterday,"" said DeMont\'s wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. ""He would not be here as we see him today.""\n\nSeattle officials hope DeMont\'s story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it.\n\nDeveloped by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city\'s 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator.\n\nAbout 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events.\n\nHe came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant.\n\n""The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,"" Price said. ""The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.""\n\nIt occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said.\n\nIt\'s not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient\'s outcome.\n\nMadeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she\'d ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions.\n\nForcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over.\n\n""I hadn\'t responded to a cardiac arrest before,"" Forcade said. ""I thought, \'Did he just fall?\' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, \'Oh, man, who\'s going to step up?\'""\n\nHe told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said.\n\nFor DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — ""You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected"" — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference.\n\n""There\'s hope,"" DeMont said.\n\nHe\'s due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance.\n\nFor that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe.\n\n———\n\nFollow Johnson at https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle\n\n———\n\nThis story has been corrected to say man was in cardiac arrest instead of having heart attack, and to say that about 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond,']",What research was conducted to show this app is beneficial? And how solid was that research?,"This is a story about the use of an app called PulsePoint in the care of a Seattle victim of sudden cardiac arrest.
In the process of telling a patient story that ended well, the reader is provided with information on the app’s development, its current use across the country and how the reader can become involved in what can best be described as the crowdsourcing of out-of-hospital care for victims of cardiac arrest.
While certainly an intriguing use of technology that merits news discussion, the story left us with questions: What research was conducted to show this app is beneficial?

The largest study comprised approximately 230,000 Finnish women and the follow-up time in different studies was up to 20 years.\n\nMenopause may explain women\'s higher dementia risk\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is the most common cause of dementia, and two out of three Alzheimer\'s cases are women. One possible explanation for women\'s higher dementia risk is the postmenopausal depletion of sex steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen receptors are present throughout the body including brain areas primarily affected in Alzheimer\'s disease. In in vitro and animal studies, estrogen has showed neuroprotective effects. However, studies on humans have yielded inconsistent results on the association between postmenopausal estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy and dementia risk.\n\nHormonal therapy may protect cognition if started at the onset of menopause\n\nIn the present study, long-term use of hormonal replacement therapy was associated with a better performance in certain cognitive domains - global cognition and episodic memory - and a lower risk of Alzheimer\'s disease. Short-term use was not significantly linked to dementia risk, but in one cohort, dementia risk was higher among short-term users who had started hormone therapy in the late postmenopausal period. The results were adjusted for various lifestyle, socioeconomic and demographic variables.\n\n""In the light of these findings, hormonal replacement therapy may have a beneficial effect on cognition if started early, around the time of menopause. The protective effect of hormonal therapy may depend on the health status of neurons at baseline and may be lost if therapy starts years after menopause,"" Dr Imtiaz concludes.\n\nThe study also showed that the postmenopausal removal of ovaries, uterus or both was not significantly linked to the risk of Alzheimer\'s disease, irrespective of the indication of surgery or hormone therapy use.\n\nThe research data was from the MEDALZ (Medication use and Alzheimer\'s disease), OSTPRE (Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention Study) and CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) studies. The newest results were published recently in Neurology and Maturitas and the earlier results in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\n###\n\nBushra Imtiaz\'s doctoral thesis Hormone therapy and the risk of dementia, cognitive decline and Alzheimer\'s disease is available for download at: http://epublications. uef. fi/ pub/ urn_isbn_978-952-61-2403-2/ index_en. html\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nBushra Imtiaz, MD, MPH\n\nUniversity of Eastern Finland\n\nNeurology\n\nbushra.imtiaz@uef.fi or bushraali2007@gmail.com\n\nAnna-Maija Tolppanen\n\nAcademy Research Fellow, Associate Professor\n\nUniversity of Eastern Finland\n\nSchool of Pharmacy\n\ntel. +358 50575 9530\n\nanna-maija.tolppanen@uef.fi\n\nRecent publications:\n\nPostmenopausal hormone therapy and Alzheimer\'s disease, a prospective cohort study.

Sure, I talk to my students about personal responsibility, but when it comes to the health of populations, I look for big fixes more than for small acts of will.\n\nThat’s why my ears perked up when I heard that two old physician friends had decided to start taking, as a preventive measure, some of the medications often included in what the field has dubbed the “polypill.” My friends are both top doctors in their 60s, with good diet and lifestyle, and this is now part of their personal health regimen.\n\nA polypill might include any of several things: a baby aspirin, a statin to rebalance cholesterol, a drug to control blood pressure and one to lower blood sugar. (A version less comprehensive than this is available online with a doctor’s prescription at Polypill.com.) Whatever the combination, the doses are low, so it’s relatively safe. It’s like a multivitamin, but with serious medications. Some public-health advocates now argue that everyone over 50 should be on one.\n\nYou read that right: everyone. If we had perfectly healthy lifestyles, these drugs would not be needed, but we don’t. And even if we did, the drugs might add further protection.\n\nOne review of the research on polypills comes from Melvin Lafeber and his colleagues at the University Medical Center Utrecht (Netherlands). Writing in Current Hypertension Reports in April, they found reason to think that treatment might help higher-risk individuals and urged more clinical trials. If moderate- and high-risk people benefit, “the idea of offering treatment to everybody older than 50 years might raise widespread interest,” they wrote. The polypill, they concluded, “could be an important tool to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease” and make it more likely that patients take the necessary drugs.\n\nCritics worry about medicalizing whole populations, predicting that the pill would encourage bad habits and worsen health disparities. A fixed-dose combination pill is one-size-fits-all, which doctors don’t usually regard as the best medicine. But polypills might solve real problems. The drugs in them are cheap and target illnesses that afflict many millions around the world, and even patients with tailored prescriptions often fail to keep up with the various medicines.\n\nSome of the component drugs are now being evaluated for use with lower-risk populations—that is, people who don’t already have serious problems with their blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol. Though not a polypill experiment per se, a study published in May in the New England Journal of Medicine involved 12,000 people over five years. One group got two drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, the other got placebos. In the group taking both drugs, 3.6% died or had health crises; in the placebo group, 5% did. The doses were low, so the adverse effects were modest.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we should all be on the polypill, but some sensible experts, including my two doctor friends, are moving toward this sort of preventive approach for people who aren’t ill or at high risk. After all, many of us are already taking low-dose aspirin, which is possibly the riskiest of these drugs.\n\nI tend to favor this sort of blunt, comprehensive approach to public health. Much as I like menacing cigarette-package warnings, urging personal responsibility, I like cigarette taxes more (despite their regressive impact). I love “Drive Carefully” signs, but I like seat belts better. And I like air bags best: No judgment, no decision, no defiant will. As for driving under the influence, breathalyzer tests and taking keys away beat the heck out of admonitions to be sober and find a designated driver.\n\nHuman nature is not our ally in maintaining health. With heart disease and stroke, many millions of lives are at stake, and for me it comes down to this: Will popping a polypill work better than willpower? I suspect that the answer may turn out to be yes.']",While the notion is interesting–can a one-size-fits-all polypill help safely and effectively stave off diseases of aging–the story didn’t include enough for information for readers to understand the issue.,"This is a story about a physician’s viewpoint on a speculative drug known as a “polypill”  to battle “heart disease, diabetes and other illnesses all at the same time.” This pill would be used in a preventive way among all healthy adults older than 50.
While the notion is interesting–can a one-size-fits-all polypill help safely and effectively stave off common diseases of aging–the story didn’t include enough information for readers to understand the issue. Evidence-wise, we don’t get a sense of if there are any clinical trial results examining the benefits of using a polypill among a healthy population of older adults. Important trade-offs like side effects are dismissed, and there’s very little indication of if or when such a pill might be available to a general population.

""But we don\'t have studies saying that they decrease the risk of death from prostate cancer.""\n\nA total of 8,231 men between the ages of 50 and 75 took part in the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAll of the men had elevated blood levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), which indicated an increased risk for prostate cancer. But none had evidence of cancer when biopsies were performed within six months of entering the trial.\n\nStudy researcher Gerald L. Andriole, MD, says a significant proportion of men screened for prostate cancer fall into this clinically ambiguous category of having elevated PSAs and negative biopsies.\n\n""We know from experience that many of these men are likely to have microscopic prostate tumors that were missed by their original biopsy,"" he says in a news release.\n\nThe men were assigned to receive either placebo treatments or daily 0.5-milligram doses of Avodart for four years. Scheduled biopsies were performed two and four years after they entered the trial.']","A fairly thorough review, covering costs, benefits (with a stab at absolute risk reduction), and harms.  Caveats and uncertainties were emphasized. ","This week in The New England Journal of Medicine is the second of two major studies showing a reduction in prostate cancer incidence from a drug in the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor class. The drug Avodart, commonly used to treat enlarged prostates, was shown to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer from 25% to 20% over 4 years in men with an elevated PSA but no prostate cancer on biopsy. With the results of this study, the drug maker, Glasko Smith Kline, is now seeking FDA approval for the drug for this indication. However, the results are far from a slam-dunk and the implications are controversial.
Adding to the contoversy are several factors: 1) no studies have shown a decrease in deaths from prostate cancer; 2) the side effects of the drug are significant (including a troubling finding of increased risk of heart failure); 3) lowering PSA levels is not necessarily of benefit; it just proves that the drug acts to shrink the prostate; and 4) the costs of the drug are huge – at $4 a day, it could cost up to $500,000 to prevent one case of prostate cancer (https://www.healthnewsreview.org/blog/2009/05/a-half-million.html).
This story does a nice job of describing the current study, quantifiying the benefits and discussing the controversy. It provides balance by quoting independent experts with no financial or personal interests in the results and by fully disclosing the potential harms of the drug.

Paleo has a devout following who swear by its protein-heavy meals, while intermittent fasters believe that forgoing food for hours on end (which varies, but can include skipping meals for an entire day), provides the best results. For those who just can’t give up grains (or regular eating), a new study indicates that being less restrictive is actually better for your waistline.\n\nRelated: How to Lose Weight and Keep it Off? Eternal Dieting Vigilance\n\nResearchers from The University of Tasmania in Australia found that breaking up with your diet for two weeks could lead to more weight loss—and help you keep it off, too.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nFor the small study just published in the International Journal of Obesity, the team enlisted 51 obese men from the ages of 25 to 54 years old. All participants had maintained their current weight for six months leading up to the study and did not exercise regularly. One group of men followed the diet, which reduced calorie consumption by about one-third of their individual needs, for 16 weeks straight. The experimental group stuck to the eating plan for two weeks, before ditching the diet for two weeks. They repeated the cycle until they had also dieted for 16 weeks; however, in their case, each bout of restriction was followed by a period of eating enough calories for weight maintenance.\n\nAt the end of the study, the men following the intermittent diet plan lost 47 percent more weight than the control group. And while it’s common to regain a few pounds after returning to previous eating habits, the two-week dieters kept the pounds off, maintaining a nearly 18-pound loss six months after the study.\n\nKrista Varady, an outside researcher who studies intermittent fasting (not the same as intermittent dieting) and weight loss at the University of Illinois, believes the results were significant.\n\n""I was really impressed that they still saw almost a two kilogram weight loss during that last period at the end of the four months,"" she tells Newsweek. ""At that point we see almost zero weight loss,"" she explains of her own research. ""Somehow they’re kind of keeping the body on its toes.""\n\nThis trick may help combat the dreaded weight loss plateau that plagues dieters looking to lose those last five pounds. As we cut calories and lose weight, our resting metabolic rate eventually slows and our bodies become less efficient at shedding mass in a process known as adaptive thermogenesis. While frustrating, it’s one of our natural survival mechanisms to prevent potential starvation.\n\nRelated: Obesity Crisis: Two Billion People Now Overweight and U.S. is One of the Fattest Nations on Earth\n\nAnother benefit from intermittent dieting? People who have a difficult time staying motivated may find relief by the two-week breaks. However, it’s important not to think of them as cheat days. The dieters ate enough calories to maintain their weight during the off period. But, Varady believes it’s probably safe to enjoy a slice of cake or bowl of ice cream during the break.\n\n""It seemed like they probably had a couple of cheat days here and there,"" she says of the data. ""Diets tend to work if you have a couple of cheat days during the month. Just as long as it doesn’t psychologically derail people.""\n\nThis story was updated to include analysis from weight loss researcher Krista Varady, PhD, a nutrition professor at the University of Illinois, Chicago.']","Diet studies are guaranteed instant news hooks, so it’s important that stories about them offer abundant context and detail.","This article describes a small and limited study (men only!) concluding that “intermittent” dieting that gives participants alternating cycles of two weeks of less restrictive weight-maintenance eating after two weeks of more restrictive calorie counts results in more weight loss over time.
The article properly notes the potential benefits of such a plan–better compliance and some possible metabolic assist that prevents dieting “plateaus” that frustrate so many trying to lose pounds. But while the article acknowledges the flaws in most trendy diets, it doesn’t offer readers enough specific information to determine whether this variation on the dietary theme will work for them any better than any other diet. For example, it doesn’t say what the two arms of the intermittent diet included in actual calorie counts and/or foods; what the starting and ending average weights were for the study group; or even how the researchers kept track of what the participants were actually eating or doing other than (presumably) weighing them every two weeks.

Check the data,"[""NEW YORK (Reuters Health) — Could one hour be all you need to quit smoking, without cravings or side effects?\n\nA woman has an unlit cigarette in her mouth in New York City, September 15, 2010. REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nThat’s what Innovative Laser Therapy, a New Haven, Connecticut-based company, advertises on its website. The clinic uses low-level lasers - similar to those sometimes used to treat arthritis-related pain - to target specific acupuncture points on the body related to addiction, metabolism and stress, and claims that most patients can quit smoking after one session.\n\nIn that session, the laser is pointed at spots on the face, hands and wrist, with the aim of relieving withdrawal symptoms and preventing cravings.\n\n“When you smoke a cigarette, you artificially tell your brain to release endorphins,” Frank Pinto, the owner of Innovative Laser Therapy, told Reuters Health. Therefore, quitting leads to a quick drop in endorphin levels, he said.\n\n“The laser basically stimulates the nerve endings to tell the brain to release a flood of endorphins” to boost a patient over that initial 3-5 day hump of withdrawal symptoms, he said.\n\nThe treatment also targets other points that are thought to suppress appetite — to prevent the weight gain that often comes with quitting smoking — and promote relaxation, according to Innovative Laser Therapy.\n\nBut does it work?\n\n‘NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE’ IN SCIENTIFIC TERMS\n\nThere's limited research showing that laser therapy might help some smokers quit. Innovative Laser Therapy cites one study, a 2008 paper published in the Journal of Chinese Medicine, available on their site at link.reuters.com/pus95p. A UK-based team found that smokers that had four laser treatments over two weeks were more likely to quit than smokers that had three treatments. Those in the three treatment group, in turn, had better success rates than a control group that was given fake laser treatments.\n\nAfter 6 months, 55 percent of the four-treatment group was smoke-free, compared to 19 percent of the three-treatment group and 6 percent of those who were treated with fake lasers.\n\nThe authors weren’t able to follow most of the 340 participants for more than 6 months after treatment, so they don’t know if those who stopped smoking started up again, or if they really quit for good. And the journal’s site - which offers lasers and other treatments for sale — does not say whether it is peer-reviewed.\n\nIn contrast, a 2000 Singapore study of 330 adolescents found no difference in 3-month quitting rates for participants treated with real or fake laser therapy.\n\n“In scientific terms, this one (UK) study is not enough evidence to recommend (the) laser for smoking cessation,” Dr. Adrian White told Reuters Health by email. Dr. White is a research fellow at Peninsula Medical School in the UK who co-authored a review of laser therapy and similar smoking cessation methods for the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. “The results conflict with the other study, and they seem ‘too good to be true.’”\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 Americans is a current cigarette smoker, and the majority of them smoke every day. The American Heart Association reports that more than 80 percent of smokers say they want to quit. But many smokers try more than one smoking cessation method or take years of trying before they do quit for good.\n\nPinto launched Innovative Laser Therapy after he successfully quit smoking with a round of laser therapy from a clinic in Florida. His company charges $350 for a one-time treatment that takes less than an hour, and offers free extra treatments to patients who are still struggling with quitting in the following 6 months. Other companies do a few shorter therapy sessions as part of their regular treatment plan.\n\nNOT FDA-APPROVED FOR QUITTING SMOKING\n\nUsing acupuncture methods to treat addictions such as smoking is not new, White said, but there is still no clear evidence that treatment with needles has any therapeutic effects either.\n\nAnd while the laser device used by clinics including Innovative Laser Therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for temporary pain relief, the agency has not cleared it to be marketed for smoking cessation.\n\nThe UK study found that the side effects of the treatment were similar to some withdrawal symptoms, and the FDA has classified the laser as a “nonsignificant risk” device. Pinto says that the biggest side effect he sees is that “people feel relaxed during the treatment.”\n\nNeil Camera, the president of Laser Therapeutics, Inc., says that FDA approval could be on the horizon. His company, which produces the lasers and supplies them to centers that are running clinical trials on the treatment’s effectiveness, has had an application for approval in to the FDA for three and half years, he said.\n\nBut the government organization had only dealt with drugs - not new technology - for smoking cessation, which has slowed down the process, Camera said. “The FDA didn’t know how to handle it, quite frankly,” he told Reuters Health. “That was the biggest drawback.”\n\nDr. Neil Spielholz, of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, was involved with the initial study submitted to the FDA - the same one that showed the success of laser treatment in UK smokers. The FDA had a couple of problems with that study, he said, including that successful quitting was measured by a smoker’s own reports, and not by more modern methods that calculate the amount of carbon monoxide in someone’s breath. In response, Laser Therapeutics is designing another study to address those comments, he said.\n\nA spokesperson from the FDA confirmed that the agency is aware of the concept of using low level lasers for smoking cessation and had been in discussions with those seeking to get it approved on how they should proceed.\n\nUsually three convincing studies involving large groups of human patients are needed before the FDA decides to approve a treatment.\n\nPinto says that Innovative Laser Therapy follows up on the success of all of its clients a month after the treatment for clinical evidence that will be part of the package of data presented to the FDA.\n\n“The company (Laser Therapeutics) is going crazy,” Spielholz told Reuters Health. “They want to get this thing approved, obviously.”\n\nBut, he said of the initial evidence in favor of the treatment, “this one is only a single study, which of course the people who believe in lasers will jump on ... (but) things have got to be confirmed. One study, no matter how many patients are in it, really needs one or two confirmation studies.”\n\nWON’T WORK ON EVERYBODY\n\nIf future studies do show its effectiveness, laser treatment would have a leg up over conventional methods of smoking cessation, such as medications including Chantix and Zyban, said Spielholz, who continues to work with Laser Therapeutics on getting FDA approval.\n\nThe lack of any drugs involved in laser therapy “would be the beauty of this,” he said. “You do not have those side effects of suicidal thoughts and feelings of paranoia that are reported for the drugs,” he said.\n\nStill, Laser Therapeutics’ Camera said, the treatment won’t work on everybody. “The person has to be wanting to quit smoking,” he said. “They can’t be dragged in by a spouse or whatever, because nothing’s going to work then.”\n\nDr. Martha Daviglus, who studies preventative medicine at Northwestern University, agreed that the most important part of any smoking cessation program was that smokers were ready to quit. After seeing the initial research, she’s hopeful, but cautious, about low-level laser therapy as a way to help people do that.\n\n“There are hundreds of methods to quit smoking,” she said. “We can hope that this is going to be a method that is going to help people.” But, Daviglus said, “We need more research and more evidence.”""]"," We don’t often see subheads like this: ""’NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE’ IN SCIENTIFIC TERMS; NOT FDA-APPROVED FOR QUITTING SMOKING; WON’T WORK ON EVERYBODY.""

Similar results were obtained by the National Cancer Institute USA in tests conducted on 60 cell lines.\n\nThe new drug works by forcing cancer cells to use their mitochondria, the ‘power house’ of a cell, to generate the energy necessary to function. Whilst healthy cells use mitochondria to generate energy, cancer cells contain defective mitochondria which are incapable of sustaining the cell’s energy requirements.\n\nIn the absence of FY26, cancer cells switch from using their defective mitochondria to using metabolic activity in their cytoplasm to generate energy. By stopping this switch of energy source, the drug causes the cancer cell to die.\n\nLead researcher Professor Peter Sadler, of the University of Warwick’s Department of Chemistry, said explains:\n\n“Healthy cells generate their energy in organelles called mitochondria, but cancer cells have defective mitochondria and are forced to generate energy through glycolysis in the cytoplasm. Our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells”.\n\nCommenting on the drug’s benefits when compared to existing platinum-based drugs, such as Cisplatin, Professor Sadler says:\n\n“Platinum-based drugs are used in nearly 50% of all chemotherapeutic regimens and exert their activity by damaging DNA and cannot select between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. This can lead to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting.”\n\n“Existing platinum-based cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course, as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked, but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action, remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as Cisplatin”.\n\nThe research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates, suggests co-researcher Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon:\n\n“Current statistics indicate that one in every two people will develop some kind of cancer during their life time, with approximately one woman dying of ovarian cancer every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK and two deaths every hour from bowel cancer.\n\n“It is clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more lives and our research points to a highly effective way of defeating cancerous cells”.\n\nThe research, supported by the European Research Council and titled Potent organo-osmium compound shifts metabolism in epithelial ovarian cancer cells, is published by PNAS. The paper describes the comprehensive systems biology approach used to elucidate the mechanism of osmium action of FY26, led by PhD student Jess Hearn. Importantly this analysis also pinpointed 3 mutations in the mitochondrial DNA of ovarian cancer cells.\n\nFollowing the successful test results the researchers have been awarded a Wellcome Trust Pathfinder grant to begin preclinical development of organo-osmium compounds.\n\nENDS.\n\nPR144 7 July 2015\n\nNotes:\n\nThe researchers thank the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (Grant 324594, Systems Biology studentship for J.M.H.), the European Research Council (Grants 247450 and 324594), and the Wellcome Trust (Grants 086357 and 102696) for support, as well as the European Union COST Action CM1105.']",This release about an experimental cancer drug was overly promotional in tone and did not provide many of the key pieces of information that we think news releases should convey about research.,"This University of Warwick release promises much more than it should, considering the research was conducted not on humans or even mice but on cell lines in labs. The release headline claims that a new compound called FY26 is “49 times more potent” than an existing chemotherapy, and a subhead says, “Effectiveness shown in tests on ovarian and bowel cancer.” But it’s a bit misleading to claim increased potency for a drug that’s never even been tested in humans, because the compound may not work the same way in humans as it does in a petri dish. The drug certainly faces a very long and uncertain road before it might be approved for use in actual cancer patients — something the release never warned readers about. This is interesting research that’s worth writing about, but the release desperately needed a statement cluing readers in to the very preliminary nature of the study.

These tumors were those that had returned following an initial surgical removal and follow-up treatment with procedures such as chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nSurvival rates using cryoablation were about 60 months, which is comparable to the survival rates for women whose tumors do not return after the first surgical procedure. However, about 80 percent of women who first treat their tumors with surgery do eventually experience a recurrence, according to Hyun J.

In comparison, treating initial tumors with surgery and therapies such as chemo has only resulted in a 43 percent success rate, historically, Bang said.\n\nCryoablation of many tumors may be considered a treatment alternative, especially for those with anesthesia risks, painful lesions or those who want local control during chemotherapy, the researchers concluded.']","Treatment for advanced ovarian tumors may lengthen survival, but questions still remain, despite the story’s emphasis on “promising” and “new hope.”","This story reported on a procedure to freeze recurrent ovarian cancer tumors which showed improvements in survival rates.  However, the story doesn’t say what the actual survival rate was.  A similar story by Medscape did a much better job of describing cryoablation as a procedure which is currently being used in palliation of symptoms and not meant as a curative treatment of the tumors.

It works by significantly reducing the rate at which blood clots break down, the researchers explained.\n\n""When people have serious injuries, whether from accidents or violence, and when they have severe hemorrhage they can bleed to death. This treatment reduces the chances of bleeding to death by about a sixth, "" said researcher Dr. Ian Roberts, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the U.K.\n\nAccording to Roberts, each year about 600,000 people bleed to death worldwide. ""So, if you could reduce that by a sixth, you\'ve saved 100,000 lives in one year,"" he said.\n\nThe report, which was primarily funded by philanthropic groups and the British government, is published in the June 15 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nFor the study, Roberts and colleagues in the CRASH-2 consortium randomly assigned more than 20,000 trauma patients from 274 hospitals across 40 countries to injections of either TXA or placebo.\n\nAmong patients receiving TXA, the rate of death from any cause was cut by 10 percent compared to patients receiving placebo, the researchers found. In the TXA group, 14.5 percent of the patients died compared with 16 percent of the patients in the placebo group.\n\nWhen the researchers looked at deaths from bleeding, those in the TXA group experienced a 15 percent reduction in mortality. Among patients receiving TXA, 4.9 percent died from bleeding, compared with 5.7 percent of the patients receiving placebo, they found.\n\nAlthough there was some worry that TXA might lead to more heart attacks, strokes or clots in the lungs, the researchers observed no such increase among patients getting the drug.\n\nDr. Jerrold H. Levy, deputy chair for research at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that, ""these data are really neat, because any therapy to reduce mortality in trauma is, I think, a major finding.""\n\nUsing this drug to treat trauma patients is a completely new idea, Levy said. ""I think people should consider it [TXA] following trauma on the basis of this study,"" he said.\n\nCurrently, TXA is not generally used in emergency rooms to treat trauma patients, but Roberts believes that this study could change that.\n\n""It\'s not our job to tell doctors how to treat their patients, but this is a drug that is safe and effective in a condition where people have a high risk of death,"" he said.\n\nThe researchers believe that TXA could have even wider uses, such as reducing brain bleeds after brain injury. The drug could also be used to reduce postpartum bleeding, which the researchers say causes some 100,000 deaths a year worldwide.\n\nIn fact, a trial to see whether TXA can reduce postpartum bleeding has started, the team noted.\n\nLevy however, cautioned that the results of this study apply only to TXA and do not mean that people should try similar drugs hoping for similar results.\n\n""Everybody wants to be creative, but you have to look at the data, and they used TXA,"" Levy said. ""You can\'t get creative and say \'Ah, one of the other drugs will do the same thing\' -- you don\'t know that, and that\'s one of my concerns.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on trauma, visit the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Science.']","Like its competitors (we reviewed 3 such stories), HealthDay communicated the basic facts but failed to challenge some of the more optimistic claims regarding the lifesaving potential of the drug TXA.","The story also should have done more to examine whether the results of this international study are applicable to patients in the United States and other Western countries.

Tell them it’s a drug that costs $100 per dose. And if you want to make it even more effective, tell them it costs $1,500 instead.\n\nThat’s what researchers from the University of Cincinnati discovered in an unusual clinical trial. Instead of testing a placebo against an actual drug, they pitted two placebos against each other. The only difference between the two sham treatments was their purported price.\n\nMedical researchers are well aware that the dummy pills used in clinical trials often provide as much relief as the actual drugs being tested. This is what’s known as the placebo effect, and it’s quite common in people with Parkinson’s, a movement disorder that causes tremors, stiffness and balance problems. A 2008 meta-analysis found that placebos used in clinical trials of Parkinson’s treatments improved symptoms by an average of 16%.\n\nThe team from the University of Cincinnati and their colleagues had a hunch that patients would be more responsive to a fake drug they thought was real if it came with a heftier price tag. The higher price would be seen as a signal that the treatment was better, they figured.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo they recruited 12 patients with “moderately advanced” Parkinson’s and asked them to participate in a clinical trial of a medication described as “a new injectable dopamine agonist.” Patients with Parkinson’s lose the brain cells that produce dopamine, and a drug like this could pick up the slack.\n\nThe study volunteers were told that there were two versions of the experimental drug and that both were believed to work equally well. The main difference, the story went, was the way they were made. As a result, one version cost 15 times more than the other.\n\nIn reality, both placebos were composed of the exact same saline solution. And yet, the patients perceived the expensive version to be more effective than the cheaper one, according to results published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.\n\nBoth of the placebos improved motor function compared with a base line test. But when patients got the $1,500-per-dose placebo, their improvement was 9% greater than when they got the $100-per-dose placebo, the researchers reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn another test, 67% of the patients were judged “very good” or having “marked improvement” after they took the expensive placebo, compared with 58% of patients after they took the purportedly cheap placebo.\n\nThe researchers also used functional MRI scans to assess the patients’ brain activity and found that the “cheap” placebo prompted more action than the “expensive” one. To the researchers, this was a sign that the patients expected less from the placebo they believed cost less, so their brains responded by doing more work.\n\n“Patients’ expectations have an important role in the efficacy of medical therapies,” the researchers wrote. Another manifestation of this is the preference many patients have for name-brand drugs instead of their generic counterparts, they added.\n\nPlacebos may be fake, but understanding the placebo effect – and finding ways to make the most of it – is a real priority for researchers. To the extent that doctors can use placebos to improve patients’ symptoms, they can use the real drugs less, which may be expensive or toxic.\n\n“Placebo can be the physician’s friend,” a pair of neurologists wrote an editorial that accompanied the study. “The outcome of this study … opens our eyes to another nuance of placebo effect.”\n\nFor medical news that’s the real deal, follow me on Twitter @LATkarenkaplan and “like” Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.']",A pretty good overview of an interesting study on placebos. It had one significant omission.,"This story summarizes a study that tested responses to two placebos — one cheap and one expensive — in patients with Parkinson’s disease. The expensive placebo seemed to work better, but the effect was small. The study itself was also tiny — just 12 patients — which is something we think the story should have called more attention to.

But ketamine has not been tested in a large clinical trial, and all evidence of its antidepressant effects has come from anecdotes and small studies of fewer than 100 patients. Now, in the largest study of its kind, researchers at Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at University of California San Diego mined the FDA Adverse Effect Reporting System (FAERS) database for depression symptoms in patients taking ketamine for pain. They found that depression was reported half as often among the more than 41,000 patients who took ketamine, as compared to patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain.\n\nThe study, published May 3 in Scientific Reports, also uncovered antidepressant effects for three other drugs typically used for other purposes -- Botox, the pain reliever diclofenac and the antibiotic minocycline.\n\n""Current FDA-approved treatments for depression fail for millions of people because they don\'t work or don\'t work fast enough,"" said senior author Ruben Abagyan, PhD, professor of pharmacy. ""This study extends small-scale clinical evidence that ketamine can be used to alleviate depression, and provides needed solid statistical support for wider clinical applications and possibly larger scale clinical trials.""\n\nAbagyan led the study with pharmacy students Isaac Cohen and Tigran Makunts, and Rabia Atayee, PharmD, associate professor of clinical pharmacy, all at Skaggs School of Pharmacy.\n\nThe FAERS database contains more than 8 million patient records. The research team focused on patients in the database who received ketamine, narrowing their study population down to approximately 41,000. They applied a mathematical algorithm to look for statistically significant differences in reported depression symptoms for each patient.\n\n""While most researchers and regulators monitor the FAERS database for increased incidences of symptoms in order to spot potentially harmful drug side effects, we were looking for the opposite -- lack of a symptom,"" Cohen said.\n\nThe team found that the incidence of depression symptoms in patients who took ketamine in addition to other pain therapeutics dropped by 50 percent (with an error margin less than 2 percent) compared to the patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain. Patients who took ketamine also less frequently reported pain and opioid-associated side effects, such as constipation, as compared to patients who received other pain medications.\n\nAccording to Abagyan, it is possible that another factor common to patients taking ketamine was driving the antidepressant effect, such as the fact that ketamine also relieves pain. That\'s why they compared ketamine patients with patients taking other pain medications. That control group eliminated the possibility that people who take ketamine have less depression because they have less pain. Abagyan says it\'s still possible, though unlikely, the effect could be due to a still unidentified confounding factor.\n\nThree other drugs with previously under-appreciated antidepressant effects also emerged from this analysis: Botox, used cosmetically to treat wrinkles and medically to treat migraines and other disorders; diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); and minocycline, an antibiotic.\n\nAfter the diclofenac finding, Abagyan and team went back and looked at ketamine patients who did not also take NSAIDs and compared them to patients who took any other combination of drugs for pain except NSAIDs. Depression rates in patients taking ketamine remained low.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that the antidepressant effects of diclofenac and minocycline may be due, at least in part, to their abilities to reduce inflammation. For Botox, the potential mechanism for reducing depression is less clear. The team is now working to separate Botox\'s beauty effects (which could indirectly make a person feel better emotionally) and its antidepressant effects. To do this, they are first using FAERS data to determine if collagen fillers and other cosmetic treatments similarly affect depression rates.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people experience depression worldwide. If not effectively treated, depression can become a chronic disease that increases a person\'s risk of mortality from suicide, heart disease or other factors. Depression is currently treated with five classes of antidepressants, most commonly serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\nFor financial and ethical reasons, ketamine has never been tested for its safety and effectiveness in treating depression in a large-scale clinical trial, but it reportedly works much more rapidly than standard antidepressants. Ketamine is relatively inexpensive and is covered by most health insurance plans if three other antidepressants fail.\n\n""The approach we used here could be applied to any number of other conditions, and may reveal new and important uses for thousands of already approved drugs, without large investments in additional clinical trials,"" Makunts said.\n\n###']",A convoluted study and lack of cause and effect didn’t stop UCSD from making strong claims about ketamine.,"In this study of the effect of the anesthetic drug ketamine on depression, researchers at University of California – San Diego data-mined the FDA Adverse Effect Reporting System database for information on ketamine use for pain relief. Their analysis found an association between ketamine and reduced incidence of depression. However, the absence of depression the researchers found in 41,000 people (out of 8 million entries in the database) taking ketamine for pain relief in no way proves ketamine is responsible for the lack of depression. The release and the study it’s based on stand on a very shaky foundation.
The release’s only nod to caution about the findings is an acknowledgement that the effect of ketamine on depression could be due to an “unidentified” factor. But it does not mention the problems with this retrospective, data-mining study, the main one being that the absence of a symptom (depression) does not equate to the drug alleviating the symptom. No mention is made of the fact that the data were not collected for the purpose for which the researchers used them or the fact that there are no medical histories attached to the subjects included in the study.

Good news for the millions of people who suffer from skin wounds that won’t heal. A team of researchers at The Ohio State University has brought a potentially transformative solution to the problem by creating a portable adhesive patch that drives a continuous, small electrical current to stimulate healing and reduce the risk of infection.\n\nNearly 7 million Americans have chronic wounds – typically a result of diabetes, obesity or other conditions that impact circulation – costing the healthcare system nearly $25 billion each year. The non-healing wounds are painful, can permanently damage nerves, prevent mobility and in extreme cases, cause infection that can lead to death.\n\nThe patch’s design significantly advances existing FDA-approved wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) that harnesses the body’s innate response to injury to help wounds heal.\n\n“A wound naturally produces its own electrical fields that help reduce bacteria and promote cell regeneration; however, this function is likely impaired in chronic wounds,” said Sashwati Roy, PhD, an Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at Ohio State’s College of Medicine. “The prototype dressing mimics this physiological process, and while it has proven to create an optimal environment where chronic wounds can heal, we are always looking for new ways to keep pathogens under better control.”\n\nRoy notes that chronic wounds are particularly susceptible to infection because bacteria, which at times are free floating within a wound – can sometimes mobilize, creating colonies covered by a thick sticky coating called a biofilm. The immune system cannot penetrate the biofilm, and antibiotics can’t get in either – causing constant inflammation and low-level infection that can further dampen the healing process.\n\nNow, with support from Ohio State’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), researchers from both the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine are taking the technology to the next level. Working with a mechanical and aerospace engineering team led by Shaurya Prakash, PhD and Vish Subramaniam, PhD, the scientists have optimized the bandage’s design and the amount of electrical current delivered. Like present WEDs, the new prototype is flexible, portable and self-contained. Made of silk and silver, the experimental dressing includes a self-contained battery that delivers a continuous, safe, low-level electrical current to the injury. “We’re hoping this new design may allow electric fields and currents to penetrate more deeply into wounds, and really get to where these biofilms may be hiding,” said Subramaniam, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Ohio State. “The destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria, reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body’s natural immune response to work more effectively. Bacteria are known to quickly acquire resistance against antibiotics, but to our knowledge, bacteria do not develop resistance against electroceuticals.” To test the experimental design, Roy and a team of scientists developed an animal model to mimic the skin function of a person suffering from metabolic syndrome – obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar - which mirrors the type of patient that typically develops chronic wounds. Animal models had skin injuries infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Acinetobacter baumannii, three different types of bacteria that commonly infect wounds and develop biofilms that are treatment resistant.\n\nEarly results, which were presented at the Wound Healing Society’s Annual Meeting in April 2016 indicate that infected wounds covered by the experimental bioelectric dressing healed better and more quickly than those covered with a plain dressing that is commonly used in the care of wounds today. Scientists hypothesize that the electrical currents may disrupt bacteria in two ways: by interrupting the production of chemical messages that instruct bacteria to develop biofilms and by weakening the molecular structure of existing biofilms, potentially making them more susceptible to antibiotics or the body’s natural immune response. The team’s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population; however, the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries. Roy also notes that the U. S. Department of Defense is very interested in the dressing as a temporary measure to help prevent infection in soldiers wounded on the battle front.\n\n“This technology has a long shelf life and is compact enough to be put into any field medical kit. It could be applied immediately to wounds help keep bacteria from mobilizing and start promoting healing until the soldier could be transported to a facility for more intensive medical care.”\n\nThe team already has interest from several industry partners, and is hoping to begin testing the new technology in patients before the end of the year to determine optimal treatment duration and more about the healing effects of electrical fields on skin cells on a molecular level.\n\nRoy’s research team includes Shomita S. Steiner, PhD; Shaurya Prakash, PhD; Gayle Gordillo, MD; Vish Subramaniam, PhD and Chandan K. Sen, PhD.# # #\n\nThe Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (UL1TR001070, KL2TR001068, TL1TR001069) The CTSA program is led by the NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).

This release describes research involving a specialized bandage that directs electrical stimulation to tissue to promote  healing of chronic wounds. Researchers state that the electric field disturbs the ability of some bacteria to develop biofilms which can hamper wound healing and thwart antibiotics. Such bandages would be a boon to patients with problems of chronic wound healing, according to researchers.
Unfortunately, the release doesn’t give us much information about how the latest research findings (from an animal study) differ from previous work, or how this technology improves on the wireless electroceutical devices (WED) already FDA cleared for in use in humans.
The release would have benefited from information on the cost of the bandages, a summary of potential harms, and more quantification of benefits and description of the evidence. Another short-coming was the lack of transparency about the latest research in relationship to previous work funded by a WED manufacturer and Ohio State researchers, who also led this study.

And the existing version of the device won\'t work for most pacemaker patients because it lacks some key features.\n\nStill, a new company-funded study shows that ""this is now a possibility"" that could reduce infections and the severity of pacemaker surgery, said study author Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. ""This is going to be the future,"" he said.\n\nPacemakers zap the heart with low levels of electricity when the heartbeat becomes too fast, too slow or too irregular. Some are combined with defibrillators, which give the heart a major jolt when needed.\n\nCurrently, pacemakers include two components: a battery-powered generator that produces the electrical ""prompts"" that the wires deliver to the heart when needed, Reddy said. These wires can break or become infected, he explained, making the idea of a wire-free pacemaker appealing.\n\nThe new pacemaker is about the size of a AAA battery and provides jolts to one chamber of the heart, Reddy said. Most people with pacemakers require jolts to both chambers, so the pacemaker in its current form wouldn\'t work for them.\n\nIn the new study, researchers implanted the pacemaker in 32 people for the first time through a puncture in the skin; in 10 patients, they had to reposition it. The researchers reported positive results at up to three months. However, one patient died of a stroke while convalescing after suffering a heart injury during implantation and another had the pacemaker replaced with a defibrillator.\n\nWhy get a wire-free pacemaker? ""For patients with heart problems, this could potentially mean fewer infections related to leads and less discomfort during the implant procedure,"" Reddy said. And children who get pacemakers wouldn\'t face chest scarring, he added.\n\nDr. Saman Nazarian, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said the findings are promising and ""the new technology has enormous potential."" He expects the pacemaker ""will likely be utilized for some select patients"" after more testing.\n\nStill, he said, the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers, and may pose special risks of its own.\n\nDr. Harish Doppalapudi, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, added that there are unanswered questions regarding replacement of the new pacemakers.\n\n""When the battery of the implanted leadless pacemaker is exhausted, a new implant is necessary, with all the potential risks associated with this,"" Doppalapudi said. ""It is not known if it will be feasible to safely retrieve the old device. If the old device is left in place, it is not known what the long-term effects of this will be.""\n\nStudy author Reddy has received grant funding from Nanostim, and works for the company as a consultant. He also has received stock options from the company.\n\nThe study was to be presented Wednesday at the Heart Rhythm Society annual meeting in Denver. Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about pacemakers, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","While this story adequately addressed 7 of our 10 criteria, the 3 on which it missed were significant omissions, yet could have been easily addressed.","Strong points:  appropriate caveats about the limitations of this early stage of testing, amplified by input from independent experts.

Patients were tracked from four to 12 years, with a median of 9.2 years. The research builds on a 2006 Lancet Neurology study that followed patients for a median of 5.2 years, beginning with a group of 137 volunteers with mild cognitive impairment.The new study is important because of the long follow-up period, according to Adam Brickman, assistant professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.\n\nKnowing which patient with mild cognitive impairment patients may go on to develop Alzheimer\'s is vital information for researchers, who are looking for treatments for the fatal brain disease. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. Clinical trials can better focus their efforts if patients are known to be in the early stages of Alzheimer\'s. Generally, about 30% to 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment show evidence of underlying symptoms of Alzheimer\'s, so not everyone with this condition is a good candidate for an Alzheimer\'s trial.\n\nResearchers focused on two biomarkers previously thought to be involved in Alzheimer\'s disease: a kind of protein called beta-amyloid, and another protein type called tau. Experts believe a decrease in beta-amyloid in the fluid of the spinal cord is associated with a toxic buildup of that protein in the brain, which causes the formation of plaques linked to Alzheimer\'s disease. Tau has been tied to neurofibrillary tangles in the brain; researchers find that an increase in tau in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with Alzheimer\'s also.\n\nThe results from the study suggest that beta-amyloid is a much earlier predictor of Alzheimer\'s disease than tau, which supports the hypothesis that beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain occurs first in the course of the disease.\n\nSome of the participants, who were originally found to be stable with mild cognitive impairment after about five years, went on to develop Alzheimer\'s disease during the longer follow-up. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer\'s disease, researchers say.\n\nThe association between biomarkers in the fluid and Alzheimer\'s was also described in studies in December 2009 and August 2010, building on the idea that a spinal tap could be useful in predicting Alzheimer\'s.\n\nWhen these sorts of studies get published, Brickman and other doctors get phone calls from aging adults wondering whether they should be getting spinal taps to assess their risk. But it\'s too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman. Down the road, the ""fantasy"" is that asymptomatic people will be able to get a biomarker test to determine whether they\'ll one day get Alzheimer\'s, but that\'s not possible right now, he adds.\n\n""What I tell people is: If they’re worried about their thinking abilities, that they should make an appointment with a neuropsychology or a neurologist to get an evaluation,"" Brinkman says. ""The way we diagnose Alzheimer’s disease is by evaluating the behavior and the risk factor medical profile, not by looking at biological markers at this point.""\n\nAs scientists gain more insight into predicting Alzheimer\'s, aging adults may struggle with the question of whether they want to know their risk, especially since there\'s still no cure. Some people want to enroll in clinical trials as soon as they start showing symptoms; others would rather be ignorant of their status since there is no cure. In looking for treatments, however, researchers depend on people\'s willingness to contribute to science.\n\nThe Alzheimer\'s Association runs a system called TrialMatch. Check it out if you\'re interested in finding a trial for yourself or someone you care about.']","Thorough job, addressing all of our criteria except for the potential cost implications of such a test.","This story is a good example of what an independent expert’s perspective can bring to a piece.

Others who do not respond to metformin alone are given a second drug to help them maintain normal blood sugar levels. The researchers noted that which drug they should be prescribed is unclear.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that most patients are prescribed a class of drugs called sulphonylureas to supplement metformin. However, these drugs can sometimes lead to hypoglycemia and weight gain, which increases the patients\' risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nTo compare the effects of linagliptin to glimepiride (the most commonly used sulphonylurea), the researchers conducted a double-blind study over the course of two years. The study, which was funded by linagliptin\'s maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, involved 1,500 people from 16 countries with type 2 diabetes. None of the patients had responded to metformin alone.\n\nAlthough the effectiveness of the drugs were similar, the study showed the side effects of linagliptin were much less severe than those of glimepiride. The researchers found that 7 percent of patients on linagliptin experienced hypoglycemia, compared to 38 percent of patients treated with glimepiride.\n\nThe patients on linagliptin also had fewer heart attacks and strokes compared to those being treated with glimepiride.\n\nThe researchers argued that since linagliptin allows the body to increase the amount of insulin it produces in a glucose-dependent way, the risk for hypoglycemia may be significantly lower.\n\nAnd since hypoglycemia ""can have substantial negative clinical consequences"" in terms of risk for death, illness, mental function and poor quality of life, preventing it is crucial, study co-author Baptist Gallwitz, of Tubingen University Hospital, said in a news release.\n\nThe study authors pointed out linagliptin was licensed in 2011 and this is the first long-term study examining its safety and effectiveness. They added more research is needed to confirm their findings.\n\nOne expert said patients and doctors may still have to balance the superiority of linagliptin against its higher cost in comparison to older drugs.\n\nThe new study provides more evidence that drugs like linagliptin ""are just as good as the old standby sulfonylurea therapies, with the added benefits of inducing fewer hypoglycemic events, causing less weight gain, along with a likely decrease in cardiovascular events,"" said Dr. Stuart Weiss, an endocrinologist at NYU Langone Medical Center and clinical assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine, New York City.\n\nBut millions of Americans suffer from type 2 diabetes, so ""cost issues favoring sulfonylureas may be the only reason for preferring continued sulfonylurea use,"" he added. The results of a larger, ongoing study currently underway may help resolve the issue of whether the newer drug is worth the extra money, Weiss said.\n\nThe study was published online June 27 in The Lancet.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Diabetes Association provides more information on type 2 diabetes.']",This diabetes drug story hits most of the marks but may leave readers wanting more data.,"This tightly written comparison of the side effects from a new diabetes drug compared to the most popular drugs on the market answers most of our questions but should have provided more hard numbers to address benefits, harms and costs.

Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.\n\nAccording to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.\n\n""There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an \'ACE inhibitor-first\' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,"" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.\n\n""We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,"" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.\n\nBoth ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.\n\nAngiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin II, while ARBs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that older ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs. But, this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs, greater emphasis on quitting smoking, and wider use of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.\n\nHowever, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.\n\n""This is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents, except for better tolerability of ARBs,"" Bangalore said.\n\n""The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs,"" he added.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about blood pressure drugs, visit the American Heart Association.']","Leaning too heavily on a news release, this HealthDay story communicates the main findings adequately but lacks depth and nuance. A competing ","This brief HealthDay story explains the findings of a study by New York researchers comparing two classes of drugs — angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors versus newer angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs — used to treat cardiovascular disease.  It reports on a meta-analysis of more than 100 studies comparing either drug with a placebo or with each other and finds that both types of medications are equally effective.  The only difference being that ARBs tend to produce fewer cases of dry cough as a side effect than do ACE inhibitors.
This story is shorter and less nuanced than a competing Washington Post piece, and it relies excessively on a New York University news release. There is more information about the underlying mechanism of these drugs, something probably of less interest to readers, but less about what is new about this study and why it may be important. The story never clarifies what outcomes we’re talking about with this research — blood pressure, heart attacks, deaths? In addition, the emphasis on the finding of better tolerability does not discuss why this may be – there’s no mention of the greater likelihood of cough and angioedema with ACEIs.

Results of the technique, called deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS), will be presented Sunday at ENDO 2017, the Endocrine Society\'s 99th annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.\n\nThis study expands on the researchers\' previous finding that dTMS reduced food cravings and induced weight loss in obese individuals. Unlike deep brain stimulation, dTMS does not need an operation or implantation of electrodes. Instead, an electromagnetic coil is placed on the scalp and sends magnetic pulses to stimulate specific deep regions of the brain. Currently approved in the U.S. for treating major depression, dTMS is being studied in some countries for the treatment of other neuropsychiatric disorders, especially addiction.\n\n""We need new safe and effective therapies for obesity,"" said principal investigator Livio Luzi, M.D., professor and head of endocrinology at the IRCCS Policlinico San Donato and the University of Milan in Milan, Italy. ""Despite numerous preventive and therapeutic interventions, none has stopped obesity from reaching epidemic proportions.""\n\nAn underlying cause of obesity may be an impaired gut microbiota composition, an imbalance in the complex mix of beneficial and harmful microorganisms that inhabit the digestive tract. Luzi said scientists now know that an impaired gut microbiota can alter the brain\'s signals for appetite and satiety, or fullness. He and his co-workers studied whether dTMS could improve the gut microbiota composition in obese persons and, if so, by what underlying mechanisms.\n\nIn their study, funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, the investigators recruited three men and 11 women, ages 22 to 65, with obesity as shown by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 45 kg/m2. They randomly assigned the study subjects to two groups for five weeks to receive 15 sessions--three times per week--of either dTMS (to the insula and prefrontal cortex deep in the brain) or a sham stimulation as a control. Before and at the end of treatment, subjects provided stool samples for microbiota analysis.\n\nThe research team also measured blood levels of glucose (sugar), insulin, pituitary gland hormones and neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine. Pituitary hormones play a key role in regulating appetite, and recent research shows that norepinephrine and other neurotransmitters affect microbiota composition, Luzi said.\n\nAfter five weeks of treatment, subjects receiving dTMS lost more than 3 percent of their body weight and more than 4 percent of their fat--significantly more than controls did, Luzi reported.\n\nResults of the fecal analysis demonstrated that, after five weeks, dTMS-treated subjects had greatly increased quantities of several beneficial bacterial species with anti-inflammatory properties, such as are found in healthy people. The control group, however, had no clinically relevant alterations in their microbiota composition, Luzi said. He also reported that changes in the abundance of other bacterial species correlated with improvement of metabolic and hormonal parameters, including glucose, insulin, several pituitary hormones and norepinephrine.\n\n""These changes suggest a beneficial effect of dTMS on both weight loss and change in microbiota composition,"" Luzi said. ""Our research shows the innovative ability of dTMS in exerting anti-obesity effects through alteration of the gut-brain axis.""\n\n###\n\nEndocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers. The Endocrine Society is the world\'s oldest and largest organization of scientists devoted to hormone research and physicians who care for people with hormone-related conditions.']",This release jumps to unsupported conclusions when describing a study based on just 7 volunteers receiving the active treatment.,"The focus of this news release from The Endocrine Society is on research examining the impact of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) — a non-invasive treatment that can stimulate different regions of the brain — on weight loss, hormones and signaling molecules that can affect metabolism and appetite, and composition of the gut microbiome in 14 obese human subjects living in Italy. Microbiome refers to the community of microorganisms living in and on our bodies, most of which are within the gut, and their genetic makeup. 
The results indicated that volunteers who underwent dTMS lost more weight and fat mass than those who had a sham procedure and that changes were seen in the microbiome profile in individuals who’d had dTMS. The release didn’t discuss any changes in the sham group, and there was no discussion of where these results fit within the total body of evidence in this area of research.
Most importantly, the release takes significant liberties by stating that dTMS can directly impact microbes living in the gut, without considering the impact that weight loss and lifestyle changes have on microbial composition.
Employing a more cautious interpretation of the results, and including a discussion of costs, risks, and comparisons to other weight loss treatments would have significantly improved the release.

Phase 3 studies are needed before the vaccine could be approved.\n\nThe science is early, Hale stressed, and it will take at least five years before the vaccine could conceivably be available if ongoing studies bear out.\n\nHER2-positive breast cancer tests positive for a protein known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, which promotes the tumor cell growth. About one of every five breast cancers involves cancer cells that churn out an excess of HER2 due to a genetic mutation. HER2-positive breast cancers are often more aggressive than other types, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe goal of the vaccine, Hale said, is to educate the body to respond to that HER2-based peptide, so it will recognize the cancer when it recurs and attack it.\n\n""If your immune system has been educated by the vaccine to recognize the tumor cells, we think it will allow the immune system to take care of any individual [cancer] cells trying to set up shop,"" explained Dr. Elizabeth Mittendorf, a surgical oncologist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She is the principal investigator on the trial.\n\nThe study involved 217 breast cancer survivors who had gone through their treatment and were free of disease at the start of the trial. The women were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine paired with an immune stimulant, or the immune stimulant alone.\n\nThe women received monthly injections for six months. The researchers then conducted a variety of tests to gauge each woman\'s immune system response.\n\nThe investigators found that in the vaccinated group, 86 percent of patients showed a significant response, compared with 27 percent of those in the ""control"" group who did not get the injection.\n\nHow to explain the 27 percent who responded without the vaccine? ""For the controls, even without having their immune systems \'educated\' towards HER2 specifically, they may still mount a response because they have previously seen HER2 within their own cancer,"" Hale said.\n\nThose who were vaccinated also displayed a decrease in certain cells that suppress the immune system. That is a good thing, Hale said, because ""an increase in these cells has been found to be associated with [cancer] recurrence.""\n\nDon Diamond, director of translational vaccine research and a professor of virology at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., reviewed the findings and said, ""Their approach is well thought out and makes sense.""\n\nStill, the study remains very preliminary, he cautioned. ""Whether it actually has an increase in survival remains to be seen,"" he said.\n\nThat study will be done, Hale said, and they plan to follow the women for three years and look at survival differences.\n\nBut until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, Diamond said, no one can say if it helps the patients in a meaningful way.\n\nNumerous vaccines to prevent breast cancer recurrence are currently under study, he noted.\n\nFindings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about immune-based cancer therapies, visit the American Cancer Society.']","Key quote found too late in the story: “Until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, no one can say if it helps patients in a meaningful way.”","The current article discussed some very preliminary results of an experimental vaccine for HER-2 breast cancer.

REUTERS/David Gray\n\nIn an analysis of 29 studies, they found people who got acupuncture typically reported more pain relief than those who didn’t.\n\nBut patients treated with fake or “sham” acupuncture - using retracting needles that don’t stick in the skin, for example - estimated their pain at somewhere in between the other two groups, suggesting that they also got some benefit from the procedure.\n\n“A doctor who has a patient in pain has a lot of options,” such as medications and physical or talk therapy, said lead author Andrew Vickers, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\n“This provides evidence that they would be justified in considering… acupuncture,” he told Reuters Health.\n\nAcupuncture has been controversial among doctors as a possible treatment for a range of conditions including chronic pain and fibromyalgia.\n\nSome think it has potential as an add-on or alternative to standard treatment, while others argue any acupuncture-related benefits are likely the result of hopeful patients getting treatment they strongly believe will help them.\n\nThat either means many of the three million Americans that get acupuncture every year are “wasting their time” - or others who forgo it are missing out on potential benefits, Vickers said.\n\nTo try to help sort out which is the case, he and his colleagues analyzed 29 studies they deemed to be high-quality comparisons of acupuncture, fake acupuncture and no treatment. Those trials included close to 18,000 patients in the United States and Europe with back and neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headaches or joint pain due to osteoarthritis.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, people treated with acupuncture reported a “modest” improvement in symptoms compared to those who had sham treatment, and a larger effect compared to untreated patients.\n\nThey estimated in their Archives of Internal Medicine report that about 50 percent of patients had their symptoms cut in half with acupuncture, compared to almost 43 percent of those treated with sham acupuncture and 30 percent with no acupuncture-like therapy.\n\nA typical acupuncture session runs for about $100 and is often not covered by health insurance.\n\nUSUALLY NOT THE FIRST STEP\n\n“I have a long list of chronic pain patients coming to seek acupuncture,” said Jongbae Park, head of Asian Medicine & Acupuncture Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine.\n\nIt’s usually “not their first approach to address the condition,” he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain.\n\nPark, who was not involved in the new study, said acupuncture focuses on healing the underlying tissue injury that is causing pain, rather than treating the pain itself as medications would.\n\n“I am a biased clinician,” Park told Reuters Health. But, he added, “I would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement.”\n\nVickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/MbBLbb Archives of Internal Medicine, online September 10, 2012.""]",Comparing different stories on the same topic helps to point out relative strengths and weaknesses. The Reuters story was edged out by the competing ,"While nicely written and generally on the mark with its key messages, this Reuters story could have done a better job explaining how this new study — a systematic review — differed from the dozens of reviews that preceded it and why it is newsworthy. The key difference is that the study used a more robust methodology than previous reviews, and the findings suggest that acupuncture delivered by experts was slightly more effective than a “sham” acupuncture procedure (i.e. the effects of acupuncture are more than just a placebo). As such, there is reason believe that the new study provides a stronger assessment of the benefits of acupuncture than previous studies that have reported inconsistent findings. And clinicians may see this as justification for referring more patients to acupuncture therapy.

If the results can be confirmed, the approach could provide another tool to fight what can be a severely debilitating disorder.\n\n\n\nMigraines, which are characterized by severe pain accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light, affect an estimated 28 million Americans. Many drugs are used prophylactically to ward off the attacks, and a relatively new family of drugs called triptans has proved very successful in curing headaches once they begin. Nevertheless, about 14% of those with migraines are unable to control the problem with existing drugs and are desperately seeking other alternatives.\n\n\n\nOne such approach is an electrostimulation device developed by Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis. Thin leads are placed under the skin near the occipital nerves, which originate in the spinal cord and branch out across the back of the brain. The leads are connected to an implanted neurostimulator that delivers controlled electrical pulses to the nerves.\n\n\n\nDr. Joel R. Saper of the Michigan Head-Pain and Neurological Institute in Ann Arbor and his colleagues enrolled 67 patients in a study funded by Medtronic. All suffered from 15 or more days of headaches per month and received no relief from conventional drugs. Thirty-three of them received the Medtronic device, 17 received a sham device and the rest received conventional medical care.\n\n\n\nSaper and his colleagues reported in the headache journal Cephalalgia that 39% of patients who received the real device had at least a 50% decrease in the number of headache days per month or a significant decrease in pain intensity during the three months of the study. The most common side effect was migration of the leads, which did not cause any long-term complications.\n\n\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the report, Dr. Todd J. Schwedt of the Washington University Headache Center in St. Louis called the results ""promising,"" but noted that the success rate of only 39% indicates that more treatments are needed. Because many people suffer migraines primarily in the front of their heads, he added, treatment might be more successful if nerves there were also stimulated.\n\n\n\n-- Thomas H.

1777,story_reviews_00983,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/4384/,2011-10-24 04:00:00,Yoga and Stretching Equally Effective for Back Pain,"['Weekly yoga classes relieve symptoms of low back pain about as well as intense, regular stretching sessions, a new study shows.\n\nThe research found that yoga and stretching were equally effective in easing chronic back pain and improving function, but participants had to practice each regularly to see benefits. The subjects in both groups took weekly 75-minute classes and practiced yoga or deep stretching at home for about 20 minutes at a time at least three days a week.\n\nThe study is the largest and most thorough to date to look at whether yoga has an effect on chronic low back pain, a problem that affects millions and has no surefire long-term remedy. A number of earlier studies suggested that regular yoga classes might benefit back pain sufferers, though most were limited by small sample sizes, short study periods and other flaws.\n\nThe latest study, published in The Archives of Internal Medicine, involved more than 200 people who were followed for up to 26 weeks.\n\n“This is good news for yoga,” said Karen J. Sherman, lead author of the study and senior scientific investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. “The smaller studies which hinted that yoga might be helpful all had problems one way or another. This is a much larger study, and the findings are robust.”\n\nAbout four out of five people experience low back pain at some point in their lives, prompting Americans to spend $50 billion a year on medications, physical therapy and related costs. Exercise, and in particular strength-training routines that develop muscles of the trunk and core, can help reduce pain and improve function, though many people avoid them for fear of doing further harm.\n\nTo find out whether the movements and static poses associated with yoga could make a difference, as earlier research had suggested, Dr. Sherman and her colleagues recruited 228 people with chronic low back pain in the Seattle area. Their mean age was in the late 40s to 50, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups. One group took weekly yoga classes over 12 weeks, which typically included breathing exercises, 5 to 11 postures and guided deep relaxation. Another group went to weekly stretching classes built around aerobic exercises, deep stretches and strengthening exercises focused on the trunk and leg muscles. Both groups were given handouts and instructional CDs and DVDs and asked to practice 20 minutes at home on days when there was no class. Those in the third group served as “self-care” controls and received a book containing advice on back exercises and ways to reduce pain.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, those in the yoga group were, over all, significantly less bothered by symptoms than the control group, and they reported better function and less difficulty in mundane daily activities like walking up stairs and bending down to put on socks. The improvements remained when the researchers checked with them 26 weeks after the start of the study. Those in the stretching group saw just as much benefit as the people taking yoga. More than half of the subjects in each group improved on measurements of function by at least 50 percent, compared with less than a quarter of the controls.\n\n“Compared with self-care, yoga and stretching class participants were significantly more likely to rate their back pain as better, much better or completely gone at all follow-up times,” the study noted. “More participants in the yoga and stretching groups were very satisfied with their overall care for back pain.”\n\nDr. Sherman said that like many other therapies for low back pain, yoga probably would not work for everyone. For those who want to try, a weekly class and a few 20-minute sessions at home might be a good starting point, she said.\n\n“Does everybody need to practice at least 20 minutes a day three times a week? It probably depends on your back pain,” she said. “At a certain point in time you learn what your back needs.”\n\nAs an alternative to yoga, stretching may be a viable option. Dr. Sherman recommended taking an intensive stretching class, then establishing a routine at home. But she cautioned that her study looked specifically at deep stretching that is far more involved than the brief, light stretches most people do before or after a workout.\n\n“It’s not like stretching each leg for 30 seconds,” she said. “It’s much more intensive. You might spend two minutes stretching each leg before moving on and stretching other parts of the body, so you’re really getting in there.”']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Journalists tread on risky ground when they summarize the results of a new study and then neglect to provide ANY independent commentary.</span>","An independent expert can point out whether a study is valid and relevant and whether any cautionary notes should accompany its conclusions.




The article provided an accurate, bare-bones description of the study and its main conclusions—that yoga and intensive stretching were similarly effective and were both superior to the self-care intervention.
But it also missed several key points, as detailed in the scoring below. And since the study in the Archives of Internal Medicine was actually accompanied by an independent commentary that could have been cited, these omissions are all the more telling.
So what points might an independent expert have added to the coverage?The most important one is that the subjects in this study were relatively affluent and generally had mild back pain and modest functional limitations. The results of this study may not apply to the large body of patients from less affluent backgrounds with more severe back pain, greater functional impairment, and more complex health problems.
Would a roughneck on an oil rig, an auto mechanic, or a hotel maid gain a similar benefit from yoga or intensive stretching as the subjects in this study? No one really knows.
The availability of these treatments is also an issue. Similarly structured viniyoga programs may not be available in many communities—and it is not clear that most health insurance plans will cover them. The type of intensive stretching program described in this study would appear to be uncommon in the United States. So most patients wouldn’t have access to this intervention.
Lastly, this study did not compare yoga and intensive stretching to “usual care”. So yoga and intensive stretching may be superior to a self-care program, but it is not as clear that they are any better than routine back care as dispensed across the United States.

(Nasdaq: GHDX) today announced that the Journal of Surgical Oncology published results from a multi-center study of the Oncotype DX® DCIS Score™, demonstrating the test has significant impact on the treatment recommendations for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), also referred to as stage 0 or pre-invasive breast cancer. These study results underscore the practice-changing clinical utility of the test for many of the 50,000 women diagnosed with DCIS each year in the United States alone.\n\n""Most patients with DCIS are treated with surgery followed by radiation, yet only about 20 percent of them are likely to experience a recurrence or develop an invasive form of the disease,"" said Michael Alvarado, M.D., associate professor of surgery, the University of California, San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""These results highlight the need to optimize treatment of this non-invasive, indolent form of breast disease, and the importance of Oncotype DX in helping physicians reduce over- and under-treatment of DCIS.""\n\nDCIS affects one out of every five women diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States, and is often treated with surgery followed by radiation therapy and/or hormonal therapy. The Oncotype DX DCIS Score result provides patients with an individualized estimate of local (in the same breast) recurrence, which could be either invasive breast cancer or DCIS. This information helps physicians and patients personalize treatment decisions to potentially spare women with low risk of recurrence additional treatment they may not need, while identifying women with a higher risk of recurrence who may need additional treatment after surgery.\n\nConducted in collaboration with Partnership for Health Analytic Research, this prospective study analyzed 115 patients from 10 cancer centers in the United States. The results showed that physician treatment recommendations changed for 31 percent of patients after receiving the DCIS Score result, reducing the number of patients receiving a radiotherapy recommendation by approximately one-third. Importantly, of the patients initially recommended not to receive radiotherapy, 32 percent were identified as having a high risk of recurrence and recommended to have radiotherapy. Physicians in this study rated the DCIS Score as the most important factor in planning treatment compared with pathologic features, patient preference, patient age, comorbidities or consultation with other physicians.\n\n""The Oncotype DX DCIS Score result was validated in two studies including nearly 900 patients and is the only genomic test for patients with pre-invasive breast cancer,"" said Phil Febbo, M.D., chief medical officer, Genomic Health. ""The publication of this clinical utility study clearly demonstrates that the Oncotype DX DCIS Score can play a key role in enhancing cancer care for patients with DCIS, and we believe that these results will support expanded adoption of and access to the DCIS Score.""\n\nAbout Oncotype DX®\n\nThe Oncotype DX® portfolio of breast, colon and prostate cancer tests applies advanced genomic science to reveal the unique biology of a tumor in order to optimize cancer treatment decisions. The company\'s flagship product, the Oncotype DX breast cancer test, has been shown to predict the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit as well as recurrence in invasive breast cancer. Additionally, the test predicts the likelihood of recurrence in a pre-invasive form of breast cancer called DCIS. With half a million patients tested in more than 80 countries, the Oncotype DX tests have redefined personalized medicine by making genomics a critical part of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

It didn’t address whether those revised recommendations would improve outcomes for patients.,"DCIS is usually diagnosed from a screening mammogram.
This company news release describes a study which found that the Oncotype DX DCIS Score test changed recommendations for radiation treatment among women with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) — a condition marked by abnormal, pre-cancerous cells inside the breast. The terminology employed by this news release is likely to be confusing to many readers. The body text includes a description of DCIS as a “non-invasive, indolent form of breast disease ” that often doesn’t progress to breast cancer. But the headline refers unambiguously to “DCIS Breast Cancer.” We think the release could have done a better job of capturing the controversy over the very name for this condition, what it means, and the confusion it causes women. There are also some important gaps in the information provided about the study and the test. The news release doesn’t mention the costs of this new test or acknowledge that the study did not assess clinical outcomes among patients (only changes in treatment recommendations that may or may not be appropriate). The release is also silent on the fact that the study was funded by Genomic Health, Inc, which makes the test, and that the study authors included company employees and researchers who are paid to speak and consult for the company.

Most Americans don\'t get the 25 to 38 grams a day that\'s recommended, depending on age and gender.\n\nBut if you\'re skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you\'re a teenage girl.\n\nA study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics concludes that eating lots of fiber-rich foods during high school years may significantly reduce a woman\'s risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nThe findings are based on a long-term study of 44,000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school. The women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years.\n\nThe researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber (28 grams per day, on average) had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate low levels of fiber (14 grams per day, on average). For the women on the high-fiber diet, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by 16 percent.\n\nOf course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. It\'s well-known that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water. Prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease. There\'s also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management.\n\nThis new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit.\n\n""This is a really important study ... [suggesting] that the more fiber you eat during your high school years, the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer,"" says Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at the Duke Cancer Center.\n\nIn a commentary accompanying the study in Pediatrics, Blackwell writes, ""There is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels."" And this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe authors point to other possible explanations, too. For instance, high-fiber diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity, since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable.\n\nMaryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. Adolescence is ""a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,"" she says.\n\nOne limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be ""recall bias"" — the women\'s memories may be foggy.\n\n""The recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned,"" writes Blackwell. On the other hand, she says, ""people\'s dietary habits don\'t really change a lot. ... In general, what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life.""\n\nSo, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers?\n\nThis is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children\'s Hospital, has thought about a lot.\n\nShe says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating. ""Unfortunately for teenagers, they\'re [into] instant gratification,"" and they\'re not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health, she says.\n\nBut, she says, explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention. ""Most teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer,"" says King. ""So I feel like that touches a nerve with them.""\n\nGiven the known benefits of high-fiber diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease, the government\'s Dietary Guidelines for Americans also say most people need to consume more.\n\nWomen are advised to consume 25 grams a day. Men are advised to consume 38 grams a day.\n\nSo, how best to reach these targets? ""Add fiber at each meal,"" says King, in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts or seeds. Pears are a great bet with 7 grams of fiber apiece.\n\nAnd check out fiber-rich snacks, like popcorn and edamame.']","Despite some strong reporting, this story leaves readers with a misleading impression of the size of the benefit seen in the study.","This story focuses on a recent study from the journal Pediatrics, which found that women who ate more dietary fiber during adolescence and young adulthood had a lower risk of developing breast cancer. The story does a nice job of addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the study — as does a competing story we reviewed from CBS. However, the story would have been even better if it had used more appropriate language in the headline. This type of study can’t prove cause and effect, and so it can’t really tell us whether fiber “may help protect against breast cancer.” The story also should’ve tried to give readers a sense of the absolute risk reduction seen in those who ate more fiber. While the story reports a 16% lower lifetime risk in the high fiber consumers, this is a relative risk reduction that we believe is misleading. Our calculations suggest that the absolute rate of breast cancer was 3.3% for the lowest fiber consumers vs. 3.1% for the highest fiber consumers, a mere 0.2 percentage point difference.

Because of that, researchers do not yet know the median survival.\n\n“You don’t need to wait for 50 percent of 675 patients to die to conclude that one drug is much better than the other,” said Dr. Antoni Ribas of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was an investigator in the trial and has been a consultant to the developer of the drug.\n\nThe other new drug, ipilimumab (pronounced ip-ee-LIM-yoo-mab), when combined with dacarbazine, extended median survival to 11.2 months compared with 9.1 months for those who received dacarbazine alone. After three years, 20.8 percent of those who got that new drug were alive, compared with 12.2 percent of those in the control group.\n\nThe results of both trials were published online by The New England Journal of Medicine in addition to being presented here.\n\nTo be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. Experts say more needs to be done, especially since melanoma affects more young adults than many other types of cancer.\n\nEven if the new drugs allow patients with metastatic melanoma to live two years, “Two years is nothing when you’re 30,” said Dr. Anna C. Pavlick, head of the melanoma program at New York University.\n\nStill, doctors and patient groups welcomed the progress because until now treatment of melanoma that had spread beyond the skin to distant organs “was terrible even by routine cancer standards,” said Dr. Vernon K. Sondak, chairman of cutaneous oncology at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso, the number of melanoma cases has been rising, unlike for many other types of cancer. Doctors say that is because of unprotected sun exposure years ago, the proliferation of tanning salons and perhaps more attention to detecting the disease.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere were about 68,000 new cases of melanoma and about 8,700 deaths last year in the United States, up from 48,000 cases and 7,700 deaths in 2000, according to the American Cancer Society. Particularly fast increases have occurred among people older than 65 and among women 15 to 39 years old.\n\nVemurafenib is the latest so-called targeted therapy, which inhibits the effects of genetic mutations that spur tumor growth and spread. In particular, the drug counters the effect of a mutation in a gene called B-RAF that was discovered in 2002 to be common in melanomas. (The drug’s name comes from V600E mutation in RAF.)\n\nThe drug, which is taken orally twice a day, would be used only by the roughly half of melanoma patients whose tumors have this mutation. The drug significantly shrinks tumors in about half of these patients — or about a quarter of all melanoma patients.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The drug is expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration within a few months.\n\nIpilimumab, the other new drug, releases a brake on the body’s immune system, allowing it to more effectively attack the tumor. Developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, it was approved in March and is sold under the name Yervoy.\n\nA series of articles in The New York Times last year followed the development of vemurafenib, then known as PLX4032, and recounted how some patients close to death seemed to make miraculous recoveries.\n\nThe effect, however, typically lasts only about seven months before the cancer starts to grow again, though some patients benefit for more than two years.\n\nS. Taylor Chance, a 67-year-old real estate agent in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., has been taking vemurafenib in a clinical trial since March 2010. “If it weren’t for the trial I wouldn’t be here,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt has not been all good. Ms. Chance said the drug caused such extreme pain at one point that “I called in the children and said, ‘I’m done, I can’t do this any more.’ ” But she had her dose reduced and took other medications for the pain.\n\nIn the trial, sponsored by Roche and led by Dr. Paul B. Chapman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, 38 percent of participants had to stop taking the drug or lower the dose because of side effects, including rash and joint pain. Many patients get minor skin cancers that can be removed by dermatologists.\n\nThe trial of ipilimumab, paid for by Bristol-Myers, involved 502 patients with late-stage melanoma.\n\nLast year at this conference, researchers presented results of a trial showing a survival advantage for patients who had undergone a previous treatment. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time.\n\nWhile the extension of median survival of two months, from about 9 months to about 11 months, was less than some experts expected, researchers said the real benefit was that a small number of patients, perhaps 10 to 20 percent, could live a long time.\n\nBecause it unleashes the immune system, ipilimumab can have serious side effects. In the latest trial, a big one was liver damage.\n\nA course of treatment of ipilimumab costs $120,000. The price of vemurafenib has not been announced, but is expected to be at least tens of thousands of dollars per year.\n\nDoctors are eager to try the two drugs together.

As many as three balloons were placed over three months, and all of the balloons were removed after six months. The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained.\n\nIn addition to the balloons, patients followed a moderate diet and behavior modification program. Whether the weight loss will last over the long term isn\'t known, said lead researcher Dr. Aurora Pryor, director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center at Stony Brook University in New York.\n\nThe study lasted a year, but ""we don\'t know what happens after that,"" Pryor said.\n\n""If they are able to stick to their newfound lifestyle with their diet and exercise program, they could maintain their weight loss,"" she said. ""The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs.""\n\nThe balloon treatment will be available starting in January, but the cost hasn\'t been announced, Pryor said. The device, called the Obalon Balloon System, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAn advantage of the balloons is that patients have no downtime and can go back to work the same day, the researchers said.\n\n""There is no sedation or recovery time when the balloons are placed, but there is sedation when the balloons are removed, so you wouldn\'t want to go back to work after that,"" Pryor added.\n\nPryor believes balloons are a better option for patients who are candidates for weight loss surgery but don\'t want surgery. ""For people who want to lose some weight but don\'t feel they are heavy enough for surgery or they\'re afraid of surgery, this is a really good next step to help them jump start their weight loss,"" she suggested.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and the Obesity Society in New Orleans. Research presented at meeting is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nOne weight-loss expert expressed some doubts about the findings.\n\n""I still question the efficacy of balloons,"" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""While there is potentially easier insertion that does not require sedation, I still doubt after removal there will be weight loss,"" he said.\n\nRoslin said patients who have other treatments that restrict their ability to eat -- such as bands and bypass operations that reduce the size of the stomach -- often regain lost weight over time. ""As time goes on, weight loss will be about lifestyle changes,"" he said.\n\nThe only argument for the balloon is that it starts the lifestyle changes, Roslin said. ""It may make it easier to become motivated,"" he said. ""But I believe that few will maintain weight loss two years after any balloon.""\n\nFor the study, Pryor and her colleagues randomly assigned nearly 400 obese patients to receive a real or sham device. All patients also had 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy every three weeks. After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed.\n\nDuring the time patients had the balloons, and for six months after, the researchers monitored their weight loss. The investigators also followed those who had not received the balloon therapy.\n\nPeople treated with the balloons lost an average of 7 percent of their weight, compared to less than 4 percent for those who received the sham device, the researchers found. Six months after the balloons were removed, nearly 90 percent maintained the weight loss they achieved during treatment, Pryor said.\n\nAs for side effects, one patient had a bleeding stomach ulcer while taking high doses of pain pills after a knee replacement. Most patients (91 percent) suffered from stomach cramps and nausea, which nearly 100 percent said were mild or moderate.\n\nThe results were also presented at a medical meeting in May.\n\nOne health and nutrition expert noted that a balloon does not equal a lifestyle change.\n\n""A gastric balloon may help with weight loss, but will do nothing to improve diet quality and overall health,"" said Dr. David Katz. He is director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center in Derby, Conn., and president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine.\n\nThe role for such technology-based approaches to weight control should be a small one, he said.\n\n""Such devices may be alternatives to bariatric surgery in some cases. But they should not distract us from the far better solution at the population level: practices, programs and policies that make eating well and being active a cultural norm,"" Katz said.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on obesity.']",It also alerted readers that this sort of medical conference presentation does not go through the peer review process that major journals use.,"Credit: FDA safety materials on Obalon
This story about a balloon swallowed by people with obesity to help them diet and lose weight is more informative than the associated conference news release we also reviewed.
The overall tone of the story balances the positive spin from a researcher with skeptical comments from independent sources. It alerts readers that this sort of medical conference presentation does not go through the peer review process that major journals use.
However, the story should have noted that the research was sponsored by the company that makes the device. It could have done a better job pointing out that the main difference between this device and other intragastric balloons already on the market is that this one doesn’t require patients to be sedated during placement. The story also didn’t point out that this type of device could cause life-threatening complications, and that the fact none were reported in this trial could be because fewer than 200 participants received the balloons.

Valley was the first hospital in northern New Jersey where an innovative technique – called pre-pectoral placement of a tissue expander -- was utilized during breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy. The procedure results in diminished post-operative pain, quicker recovery time, improved mobility, and an excellent aesthetic outcome for patients.\n\nThe technique has the potential to be a “game-changer,” says Tzvi Small, M.D., Director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at The Valley Hospital, who performed the breast reconstruction procedure on Hasbrouck Heights resident Vanessa Burt, 43.\n\n“This variation of a standard technique used during breast reconstruction will revolutionize the post-operative recovery in patients who meet certain criteria for the procedure,” notes Dr. Small. “Here at Valley, we are proud to offer this option for our patients and are excited about its potential for vastly improving patient care for women with breast cancer.” The technique involves placing tissue expanders (interim implants) under the skin on top of a woman’s pectoralis muscles after her breast tissue has been removed. After a recovery period of approximately two months — during which the woman’s chest skin heals, blood supply replenishes, and the expanders are gradually inflated to stretch the skin — the patient returns for an outpatient surgical procedure to replace the tissue expanders with permanent breast implants. In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period.\n\n“Over the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in breast reconstruction that utilize various types of surgical innovations, implants, and biologic tissue,” notes Dr. Small. “It is very rewarding as a reconstructive surgeon to continuously refine these procedures for our patients.”\n\nMs. Burt chose the Valley breast surgery team after carefully researching her treatment options for DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), a diagnosis that is often debated among clinicians as to whether it should be classified as breast cancer at all. In DCIS, abnormal cells have not spread beyond the milk ducts into adjacent breast tissue or lymph nodes. After consulting with several breast surgeons and reconstructive surgeons, Ms. Burt opted for a nipple-sparing mastectomy performed by breast surgeon Tihesha Wilson, M.D., Assistant Medical Director of Valley’s Breast Center. Immediately following in the operating room, Dr. Small performed the breast reconstruction. “This was a long journey,” says Ms. Burt, a publicist for the San Francisco-based Fat Wreck Chords music company. “Dr. Wilson was more than patient with me as I first chose active surveillance for one year and then decided to undergo a double mastectomy when another area of DCIS was identified in November 2015. I am also grateful for Dr. Small’s willingness to ‘look outside the box’ and for his determination to perform my reconstruction in a way that would give me the best results with the least amount of recovery time. I want to also commend the pathologists at Valley, who were exceptional in their diagnostic results.” Dr. Wilson and Laura Klein, M.D., Medical Director of the Breast Center, have extensive experience in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, a technically demanding surgery that is performed within aesthetically appealing minimally invasive incisions. With expertise in minimally invasive oncoplastic breast surgery, Dr. Wilson has also studied complementary medicine and provides her patients with a holistic, integrative approach to breast care. “It’s important to listen to each woman’s needs and then to decide together what is the best approach to treatment, so that in the end the cancer will be gone and the woman can move on with her life,” says Dr. Wilson.\n\nThe Valley Breast Center provides comprehensive diagnostic, surgical, and support services using a multidisciplinary approach. The Breast Center is designated by the National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers, a program of the American Cancer Society. Valley’s Breast Imaging Center has been named a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence by the American College of Radiology.']","Except in extraordinary circumstances, the result of one procedure on one patient isn’t enough to justify a news release.","It’s hard to ignore a news release that claims a reconstructive breast surgery technique is “innovative” and “has the potential to be a ‘game-changer,'” as does this one from The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey.
The release focuses on the outcome of one 43-year-old woman who received the hospital system’s first attempt at the surgery and is quoted extensively in the release. The procedure in question is available to some women who get a mastectomy following diagnosis, yet want an implant to recreate the appearance of their breast or breasts. After the breast tissue is removed, a balloon-like sac is temporarily placed in the void left behind and gradually filled with fluid. This prepares the skin and muscles nearby for a permanent implant, which is typically inserted a couple of months later for “an excellent aesthetic outcome.”
This all sounds wonderful, but our review team (which includes a breast surgeon) thought the release was nearly devoid of crucial context. It doesn’t adequately discuss costs, risks, evidence, or alternatives, and it doesn’t make clear how this procedure differs from similar, more common implant techniques. It also trumpets the outcome of one woman, whose experience with the procedure — while extremely positive — may not hold true for many women who elect to have mastectomies.
At best, this release is an incomplete advertisement.

Screening looks for signs of cancer in someone who doesn\'t have any symptoms. The idea is that by catching cancer early, before it spreads, it\'s easier to treat.\n\nStool Screening Tests\n\nOne way to look for signs of colorectal cancer is to see if there are microscopic amounts of blood in the stool using a high-sensitivity fecal occult blood test, or FOBT. Occult, in this case, means hidden. ""It\'s an indirect indicator the patient could be harboring polyps [precancerous growths in the colon],"" says Dr. Sreeram Maddipatla, medical oncologist/hematologist for the Liver Center and Pancreas Center at UF Health Cancer Center – Orlando Health. Although blood in the stool can mean there\'s a tumor or polyps, it can also be a sign of something much less serious, like hemorrhoids.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved two types of fecal occult blood tests and one stool DNA test:\n\nGuaiac FOBT. This was the first stool test for colorectal screening, says Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Mendelsohn says the concept for the guaiac FOBT originated from the idea that colon cancer bled into the colon and then into the stool. Guaiac FOBT detects heme – an iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen – in the stool. The guaiac FOBT is not specific to human heme, Mendelsohn says, so if you consume meat before the test, it could affect the results.\n\nTo do a guaiac FOBT, you\'ll use a kit to collect stool from three different bowel movements and send the samples to a lab for analysis. ""[The need for three samples] is due to the intermittent nature of bleeding from a tumor,"" Mendelsohn says. If you choose this method of colorectal screening, you\'ll need to repeat the test yearly.\n\nWhen a guaiac FOBT is performed every one to two years in adults 50 to 80 years old, it can reduce deaths from colorectal cancer by 15 to 33 percent, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nFecal immunochemical test, or FIT. The FIT detects human hemoglobin, Maddipatla says. It doesn\'t react to non-human blood, so there are no dietary restrictions prior to the test. Maddipatla says this test is easier than the guaiac FOBT, as it only requires one stool sample (which must be mailed back to the lab right away for an accurate result). Although other conditions, such as a lower gastrointestinal bleed, can produce a positive result, the FIT produces fewer false positives than the guaiac FOBT, Maddipatla says, and is almost equal to colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. The FIT is approximately 80 percent sensitive for detecting cancer and 20 to 30 percent sensitive for detecting advanced polyps. ""The colonoscopy is still the gold standard,"" Maddipatla says.\n\nUnlike a colonoscopy – a visual examination of the full length of the colon and rectum – the guiaic FOBT and FIT only detect cancers or polyps. A colonoscopy can help prevent cancer by removing polyps before they have a chance to develop into a tumor.\n\nMany patients prefer the simplicity of stool testing to undergoing a colonoscopy. However, if you have a positive result with either a guaiac FOBT or FIT, you may have polyps or colon cancer, and you\'ll need to proceed with a diagnostic colonoscopy, Mendelsohn says. ""There\'s no point in doing [stool tests] if you\'re not willing to do a colonoscopy afterwards.""\n\nFIT-DNA. You may have seen advertisements for the Cologuard FIT-DNA test. According to the NCI, Cologuard detects both tiny amounts of blood in the stool (the FIT portion) as well as nine biomarkers in three genes that have been found in colorectal cancer and advanced polyps. The NCI says for average-risk adults who didn\'t have symptoms, the FIT-DNA test detected more cancers and adenomas (advanced polyps) than the FIT, but had more false positives.\n\nMendelsohn says there are no long-term studies on FIT-DNA, so doctors aren\'t sure how frequently patients should undergo it. Medicare reimburses for the test every three years, she says, and depending on the manufacturer, the guidelines recommend repeating the test every one to three years. Mendelsohn says she is uncomfortable with the rate of false positives, which is about 10 to 13 percent. As with the guiaic FOBT and the FIT, a positive result means you still need to undergo a colonoscopy.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAdults at average risk for colorectal cancer should begin colorectal screening at age 50. Talk to your doctor about which test is right for you.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act and Medicare cover screening for colorectal cancer. Check with your insurer about which tests are covered and what your out-of-pocket costs might be.']","Fecal stool tests can be a reasonable screening test for some people, as long as folks are made aware of the constraints that accompany these tests.","In this brief story, the reporter describes three available fecal occult stool tests used to detect colorectal cancer.  The story compares the three on such dimensions as false positives and reductions in cancer deaths.
Since the story is largely descriptive, it is unfortuante that one of the important variables missing from the text is cost; the story only notes that these procedures are covered by Medicare. Readers also would have benefited from a more detailed discussion of each procedure’s debits, as well as of the nature of evidence used to determine each procedure’s accuracy.

Three of them found that zinc acetate in daily doses of more than 75 milligrams (mg) shortened colds\' duration by 42 percent, on average.\n\nFive trials using zinc salts other than acetate in daily doses greater than 75 mg shortened colds by an average of 20 percent, while another five using less than 75 mg per day produced no effect.\n\n""Much of the variation in the published study findings can be explained by the daily dose of zinc administered in the zinc lozenges,"" said Hemila, who funded the research himself. ""When focusing on those studies which have used large daily doses of zinc, there is strong evidence that zinc lozenges shorten the duration of colds.""\n\nThe study is published in The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal.\n\nDespite the popularity of zinc supplements, controversy over their effectiveness has continued since a much-publicized 1984 study first suggested a cold-limiting effect. Allowing the lozenge to dissolve instead of swallowing it seemed to provide a therapeutic effect. Since then, more than a dozen studies have been carried out, but data on the trace mineral\'s effectiveness has been mixed.\n\nAll of the trials examined by Hemila compared zinc lozenges to placebos. While surprised to note how strong the correlation was between daily doses of zinc and its effect on colds\' duration, he said he and his colleagues still don\'t know why it seems to work.\n\n""In the evidence-based medicine framework, we are primarily interested in the question whether there is an effect, and how great, whereas the mechanism of the effect is a secondary issue,"" he said.\n\nNo prior studies showed zinc lozenge use -- even up to 150 mg per day -- might cause harm aside from bad taste or constipation, Hemila said, and the most recent trial on zinc acetate indicated no significant differences between zinc and placebo groups in adverse effects even though the daily zinc dose was 92 mg.\n\nDr. Lisa Winston, an epidemiologist at San Francisco General Hospital, praised the study as a ""pretty good synthesis of the data,"" although she noted that the trials Hemila reviewed involved small numbers of participants.\n\n""It\'s an area of controversy and question . . . but I don\'t think the evidence is strong enough, nor do I think the author is suggesting, that we can base clinical practice on it,"" said Winston, also an associate professor in the University of California-San Francisco Department of Medicine. ""I would tell my patients we still don\'t have a cure [for the common cold], and we don\'t know if zinc works.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about the common cold.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Stories about the search for “cures” or even just ways to shorten the span of colds should state that most colds for most people are self-limiting and of short duration.  What is the average duration of this “misery”?

The results, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, demonstrate the first major therapy advance for the condition in nearly 40 years.\n\nFunded by the National Eye Institute (NEI) and conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), the trial compared Lucentis injections with a type of laser therapy called panretinal photocoagulation, which has remained the gold standard for PDR since the mid-1970s. Although laser therapy preserves central vision, it can damage night and side vision, so researchers have sought therapies that lack these side effects.\n\nThe trial results “provide crucial evidence for a safe and effective alternative to laser therapy against PDR,” said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n“Patients who received Lucentis showed a little bit better central vision, much less loss of their side vision, and substantially less risk for surgery than patients who received laser treatment,” said Lloyd Paul Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin Diabetes Center and Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. “These findings will change the available treatment options for patients with PDR.”\n\nDiabetic retinopathy damages blood vessels in the light-sensitive retina in the back of the eye. As the disease worsens, blood vessels can swell and lose their ability to function properly. Diabetic retinopathy becomes proliferative when lack of blood flow in the retina increases production of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can stimulate the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels. These new vessels are prone to bleeding into the center of the eye, sometimes requiring a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy to clear the blood. The abnormal blood vessels can also cause scarring and retinal detachment. Untreated, PDR is associated with high risk of visual loss. Lucentis is among several drugs that block the effects of VEGF.\n\nDr. Aiello and George King, M.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Joslin Diabetes Center and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, pioneered the study of VEGF in diabetic eye disease, beginning in the early 1990s. (Their work followed a distinguished Joslin tradition—the basic laser photocoagulation technique was developed in the 1960s by Dr. Aiello’s father, Lloyd M. Aiello, M.D., and grandfather, William P. Beetham, M.D.)\n\nAbout 7.7 million U.S. residents have diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness among working-age Americans. Among these, about 1.5 percent have progressed to PDR.\n\nThe DRCR.net enrolled 305 participants (394 eyes) with PDR in one or both eyes at 55 clinical sites across the country. Eyes were assigned randomly to treatment with Lucentis or laser. About half of the eyes assigned to the laser group required more than one round of laser treatment. In the other group, Lucentis was injected into the eye once per month for three consecutive months, and then as needed until the disease resolved or stabilized.\n\nBecause Lucentis is commonly injected to treat diabetic macular edema (DME)—a build-up of fluid in the center of the retina—the study permitted the use of Lucentis for DME in the laser group, if necessary. Slightly more than half (53 percent) of eyes in the laser group received Lucentis injections to treat DME. About 6 percent of eyes in the Lucentis group received laser therapy, mostly for issues other than DME.\n\nAt two years, vision in the Lucentis group improved by an average of about half a line on an eye chart, compared with virtually no change in the laser group.\n\nParticipants treated with laser generally lost substantial peripheral vision, but those given injections did not, emphasized Jennifer Sun, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School and physician at the Beetham Eye Institute.\n\n“This was a clear benefit associated with the anti-VEGF medication,” said Dr. Sun, who as the DRCR.net nationwide Protocol Working Investigator was instrumental in the study’s development. “Many of our patients who have laser treatment notice that they have more tunnel vision, which can lead to difficulties as they go about activities of daily life. The use of anti-VEGF treatment rather than laser for PDR could help prevent these symptoms.”\n\nAdditionally, the need for vitrectomy surgery was lower in the Lucentis group (8 of 191 eyes) than in the laser group (30 of 203 eyes).\n\nOverall, the drug’s benefits are particularly clear for people with both PDR and DME. “We know that this drug will help treat both conditions at the same time, so this is an especially appealing treatment alternative for these patients,” Dr. Aiello noted.\n\n“Lucentis should be considered a viable treatment option for people with PDR, especially for individuals needing anti-VEGF for DME,” said Jeffrey G. Gross, M.D., of the Carolina Retina Center in Columbia, South Carolina, who chaired the clinical study.\n\nThe study also suggested that Lucentis may help prevent DME. Among people without this condition at the start of the study, only 9 percent of Lucentis-treated eyes developed it, compared with 28 percent in the laser group. Scientists will follow up on that result as the DRCR.net continues to track patients for a total of five years.\n\nA separate clinical trial, now getting underway, will examine whether anti-VEGF injections given at an earlier stage of diabetic eye disease can help prevent people from developing both DME and the sight-threatening PDR stage of the disease at all, Dr. Aiello said.\n\nThe trial reported today “is a major study that may substantially change our approach to treatment of PDR,” summed up Dr. Sun. “Laser still has a role in the treatment of PDR for some patients, but anti-VEGF therapy gives us another tool in our search for better vision outcomes in our patients with diabetes.”\n\nAbout Joslin Diabetes Center\n\nFounded in 1898, Joslin Diabetes Center is world-renowned for its deep expertise in diabetes treatment and research.

If that isn\'t reason enough to fill your shopping basket, there\'s another reason to add this fruit to your grocery list. A new study, \'Fresh Pear Consumption is Associated with Better Nutrient Intake, Diet Quality, and Weight Parameters in Adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2010,\' published in Nutrition and Food Science, revealed new information regarding the health benefits of pear consumption.1 Of particular interest given the high rates of obesity in the United States, the study found that adult pear consumers had a lower body weight than non-pear consumers and they were 35 percent less likely to be obese.\n\nThe epidemiologic study, led by Carol O\'Neil of the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, used a nationally representative analytic sample to examine the association of fresh pear consumption with nutrient intake, nutrient adequacy, diet quality, and cardiovascular risk factors in adults.\n\n""The association between pears and lower body weight is very exciting,"" said Dr. Carol O\'Neil. ""We believe fiber intake may have driven the lower body weights that were seen in this study because there was no difference in energy intake or level of physical activity found between the fresh pear consumers and non-consumers.""\n\nIn addition to discovering a correlation between fresh pear consumers and lower body weight, the study found that pear consumption was associated with higher diet quality (as defined by the Healthy Eating Index). Moreover, the consumption of one medium fresh pear per day had a positive effect on nutrient intake since consumers had higher usual intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, copper, and potassium, and higher mean intakes of total sugars; consumers of fresh pears also had lower intakes of total, monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and added sugars.\n\nPears are an excellent source of fiber and a good source of vitamin C. One medium pear provides about 24 percent of daily fiber needs for only 100 calories. They are sodium-free, cholesterol-free, fat-free and contain 190 mg of potassium. The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans state that people who eat more fruit as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to reduce their risk of some chronic diseases, although little is published on the health outcomes associated with individual fruits, including pears.\n\nThe USA Pear Bureau continues to collaborate with researchers to commission additional studies that show the relationship between pears and positive health outcomes. Visit http://www. usapears. org for additional pear research, nutrition resources and recipes.\n\n###\n\nAbout Pear Bureau Northwest\n\nThe Pear Bureau Northwest was established in 1931 as a nonprofit marketing organization to promote the fresh pears grown in Oregon and Washington. Today, the United States is the third largest pear-producing country in the world, and Oregon and Washington comprise the nation\'s largest pear growing region with 1,600 growers producing 84% of all fresh pears grown in the United States. Pears grown in these two Pacific Northwest states are distributed under the ""USA Pears"" brand.

The release describes results of an “analytic,” observational, data-mining study of some subset (readers never learn what subset, exactly) of pear-eating people among participants in the 2001-10 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey of adult Americans. The data suggested that people who reported eating pears had a “lower” body weight than non-pear eaters and were “35 percent less likely to be obese.”  From there it leaps to the idea that there are health benefits to eating a “pear a day,” attributing the benefits to the relatively high fiber content of the fruit. Although the release notes that the data suggest eating fresh pears “should be encouraged” as part of an “overall healthy diet;” and the lead investigator acknowledges in a quote that this is an “association” or “correlational” study, the body of the release offers no data to support the notion that pears are more likely than any other fiber source or food to actually reduce weight or obesity. It offers no information (as did the study, published in the journal Nutrition and Food Science) about the participants or the strengths/weaknesses of the correlation. And above all it fails to note that those who reported eating pears were older and seemed to be more health-conscious — they drank less alcohol and smoked less — all of which could have contributed to or even accounted for the lower body weight and lower risk of obesity. Most of the release is a predictable promotional piece for the wonders of Barletts and Boscs, noting of course that they are “cholesterol-free,” “fat-free” and potassium-rich.

(PAHS), developer of the drug-free Freespira® treatment for panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, today announced that another study has demonstrated clinically significant symptom improvement, with 80% of patients panic attack free one year after treatment.\n\nThis latest study, conducted as part of the VITAL Program at Allegheny Health Network in Pennsylvania, also demonstrated a 50% reduction in healthcare costs in patients with panic symptoms 12 months after being treated with Freespira.\n\nA Symposium at the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) Annual Conference in Washington, DC focused on the impact of abnormal breathing patterns on anxiety-related conditions and treatments as reported in five studies. Two studies reported nearly 80% of Freespira-treated patients were panic attack free at 12 months post-treatment. Two additional studies reported that patients with mixed anxiety disorders and low exhaled CO2 at baseline were less responsive and/or discontinued treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Therapy.\n\nEarly data from a fifth study reported on Freespira treatment for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ninety percent of patients in this study experienced a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms at two months and six months post-treatment.\n\nSymposium Chair David Tolin, Ph.D., Director of Anxiety Disorders Center, The Institute of Living, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, commented, ""Studies of the Freespira treatment have shown that this innovative approach to treating patients suffering from panic symptoms and panic attacks not only significantly reduces or eliminates these symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, but also results in meaningful reduction in health costs.""\n\nDebra Reisenthel, CEO of Palo Alto Health Sciences, added, ""Patients with panic symptoms and panic attacks have 3-5 times higher medical costs than patients without panic due to higher utilization of medical resources, including ED visits, physician visits and prescription drugs.""\n\nFreespira is both easy to use and effective. Once a licensed healthcare provider authorizes the treatment and after a single training session, the patient uses Freespira at home, performing two 17-minute breathing sessions a day over a four-week period, after which the treatment is complete. The peer-reviewed published multi-center Freespira clinical trial, presented by Dr. Tolin, demonstrated that 71% of patients were panic attack free immediately after treatment and 79% of patients were panic attack free 12 months post-treatment.\n\nAbout Freespira\n\nFreespira is an FDA-cleared, drug-free, four-week at-home treatment for panic attacks and other panic symptoms. Treatment is authorized and completed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Freespira is clinically proven to reduce or eliminate panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, a mental health condition in which debilitating anxiety leads to life-altering avoidance behaviors. Individuals with panic chronically hyperventilate, even when not experiencing a panic attack. This abnormal breathing pattern has been shown to exacerbate attacks. Freespira works by training the patient to stabilize respiration rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, which reduces or eliminates panic attacks.\n\nAbout Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.\n\nPalo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. is a privately held digital therapeutic company revolutionizing behavioral healthcare with evidence-based, non-invasive, drug-free solutions. Their first product, Freespira, is an FDA-cleared treatment for individuals suffering from panic disorder, panic attacks and other symptoms of panic. In the United States, over 6.7 million adults annually suffer from panic disorder; panic attacks affect a total of 27 million adults in the U.S. every year and are a common component of other anxiety disorders.\n\nFreespira is commercially available throughout the U.S. To learn more, visit http://www.freespira.com or contact info@pahealthsciences.com.\n\nMEDIA CONTACT\n\nMichele Kong\n\n(800) 735-8995\n\nSOURCE Palo Alto Health Sciences\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://freespira.com\n\n']",The release also claims that the device reduces costs by 50% and PTSD by 90% — again without providing any evidence or study references.,"This news release claims that 80% of patients with panic attacks due to anxiety could get relief after 4 weeks of using a biofeedback device and training package known as Freespira. The device includes a sensor to measure carbon dioxide in the breath of a patient, and a tablet computer and an app to help them understand and change their breathing and potentially avoid panic attacks. The Freespira system is FDA cleared to market to patients for at-home use with physician guidance. But the release does not give us the date or publication of corroborating studies and simply says there was a presentation at a conference about these results. We are left unable to judge the news value of the latest study from such scant details.
To our knowledge, the most recent study about this biofeedback device was published a year ago.

WHEN SHOULD WOMEN GET A MAMMOGRAM? WHEN SHOULD WOMEN GET A MAMMOGRAM? Experts disagree: Age 40: The American Cancer Society says women should get annual mammograms beginning at age 40. Ages 50-74: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force says women ages 50 to 74 should get screened every other year, and women in their 40s who have a much lower risk of dying from breast cancer should decide for themselves, rather than automatically getting screened. Source: USA TODAY reporting LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM For readers, by readers: Patients, survivors, loved ones touched by any type of cancer invited to share questions, advice, experiences Nearly one year after the publication of controversial breast cancer screening guidelines by a government-appointed expert panel, a new study suggests benefits of mammograms may be more modest than previously estimated. In a nationwide study in Norway, women in their 50s and 60s who got a mammogram every other year reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 10%, compared with those who didn\'t get the exams, according to a study in today\'s New England Journal of Medicine. That\'s a much smaller benefit than estimated by even the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which says mammograms reduce breast cancer mortality by 15% to 23%. The task force\'s recommendations — advising that women may not need to begin screening until age 50 — ignited a fierce debate last November, in the midst of deliberations over health care reform. In the new study, researchers tried to determine whether recent declines in breast cancer mortality were the result of mammograms or better treatments and awareness. Norway\'s breast screening program includes mammograms as well as innovative treatment teams to coordinate a variety of specialty care. Doctors looked at two groups of women who were similar in most ways, except that one group received mammograms and the other didn\'t. While deaths from breast cancer fell 28% from 1996 to 2005 among participating women, they also fell 18% for unscreened women. That suggests that mammograms can\'t get all the credit for the falling death rate, the study says. Instead, mammograms probably cut mortality by only 10%, the difference between the two groups, the study says. Some say the new study helps women have a more realistic understanding of what mammograms offer. For 50-year-old women, mammograms may cut the 10-year risk of dying from breast cancer from 4.4 in 1,000 to 4 in 1,000, says H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth Medical School, who wrote an accompanying editorial. Welch notes that most people are unaware of the risk of mammograms: They sometimes detect slow-growing tumors that don\'t pose a threat. Because doctors can\'t reliably tell which are life-threatening, however, they tend to treat all of them. Studies suggest that for every life saved by mammograms, five to 15 women may go through unnecessary treatment, he says. Other experts note that the study may underestimate mammogram\'s benefits. Researchers followed women for an average of only two years, which may not be long enough to notice a big difference in mortality, says Daniel Kopans, a spokesman for the American College of Radiology. It\'s also possible that some women listed in the unscreened group actually got mammograms on their own, outside of Norway\'s national program, which could blur the differences between the two groups. ""The authors confirm that screenings save lives,"" Kopans said in a statement. ""There is no universal cure in sight. Until one is found, annual screening and early detection, beginning by the age of 40, offer women the best chance for a cure.""

Researchers set out to determine if this phenomenon, called the ""Mozart Effect,"" played a role in the detection rates of precancerous polyps during colonoscopies.\n\nIn their small study, two doctors performed endoscopies either while listening to Mozart or with no music at all. Both doctors improved their detection rates of potentially dangerous adenomatous polyps when they listened to music compared with their pre-study (""baseline"") rates, the investigators found. But while both doctors had better results compared to their baseline rates, one doctor did slightly better in procedures without music than with music during the study.\n\nDetection rates for the first doctor were about 67 percent while listening to music and 30 percent with no music. This was up from a baseline detection rate of 21 percent before the study began.\n\nHowever, the second doctor had an adenoma detection rate of nearly 37 percent with Mozart and 40 percent without the music, compared with a baseline detection rate of 27 percent.\n\n""Both endoscopists had higher adenoma detection rates listening to music when compared with their baseline rates,"" lead researcher Dr. Catherine Noelle O\'Shea, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said in an American College of Gastroenterology news release.\n\nThe study authors suggested that the findings could help reduce the number of people affected by invasive colorectal cancer -- the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and women in the United States, according to background information in the news release. When spotted early, potentially dangerous polyps can be removed during colonoscopies, preventing the development of disease.\n\n""Adenoma detection rate is linked to a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence, so it is an important quality indicator for colonoscopy,"" said O\'Shea. ""Anything we can do to get those rates up has the potential to save lives. While this is a small study, the results highlight how thinking outside the box -- in this case using Mozart -- to improve adenoma detection rates can potentially prove valuable to physicians and patients.""\n\nThe study was slated for presentation Monday at the American College of Gastroenterology\'s annual meeting in Washington, D.C.

However, it gives an overly optimistic spin, using the word “promising” and playing up a speculative comment in a UT Southwestern Medical Center news release that dementia cases “could drop by half” if there’s a vaccine that delays the onset of Alzheimer’s by five years.
The story also doesn’t caution that success in animals often doesn’t translate to benefits in humans, and that other treatments targeting these proteins have not panned out. Also missing: discussions of costs and potential harms and comments from independent sources.

Sadler from Warwick\'s Department of Chemistry, researchers have developed a new line of attack against cancer: an organic-osmium compound, which is triggered using a non-toxic dose of sodium formate, a natural product found in many organisms, including nettles and ants.\n\nNamed JPC11, it targets a metabolic process which cancer cells rely on to survive and multiply. It does this by converting a key substance used by cancer cells to provide the energy they need for rapid division (pyruvate) into an unnatural lactate - leading to the cells\' destruction.\n\nUniquely, this chemo-catalyst treatment can be recycled and reused within a cancer cell to attack it repeatedly.\n\nThis unprecedented functional ability to recycle and reuse the compound within cancer cells could lead to future anticancer drugs being administered in smaller, more effective, and potentially less toxic doses - decreasing the side-effects of chemotherapy.\n\nThe researchers have been focusing on the potential to use this compound on ovarian and prostate cancers.\n\nOvarian cancers are becoming increasingly resistant to existing chemotherapy drugs (such as the platinum drug, cisplatin). Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity.\n\nImportantly, the development opens up a possibility for a more selective cancer treatment as JPC11 was observed to specifically target the biochemistry of cancer cells, leaving healthy cells largely untouched - another improvement compared to existing platinum-based drugs, which can also attack non-cancerous cells.\n\nDr James Coverdale, a Research Fellow from Warwick\'s Department of Chemistry, commented:\n\n""This is a significant step in the fight against cancer. Manipulating and applying well-established chemistry in a biological context provides a highly selective strategy for killing cancer cells.\n\n""We have discovered that chemo-catalyst JPC11 has a unique mechanism of action - and we hope that this will lead to more effective, selective and safer treatments in the future.""\n\nProfessor Peter Sadler, a medicinal chemist at the University of Warwick commented:\n\n""Platinum compounds are the most widely used drugs for cancer chemotherapy, but we urgently need to respond to the challenges of circumventing resistance and side-effects. Our lab is focussed on the discovery of truly novel anticancer drugs which can kill cells in totally new ways. Chemo-catalysts, especially those with immunogenic properties, might provide a breakthrough.\n\n""It will take time to progress from the lab to the clinic, but we are fortunate to have a talented enthusiastic, international team working with colleagues in Warwick Cancer Research Centre across the borderlines of chemistry, cell and systems biology and cancer medicine who are determined to succeed.""\n\nProfessor Martin Wills, catalyst specialist at the University of Warwick, commented:\n\n""Although asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation processes are well developed in the materials industry, this research provides the first ever example of it being achieved inside cells using a synthetic catalyst.""\n\nHandedness (molecular asymmetry) is critical to the function of bio-molecules in the body. Proteins, enzymes and our DNA, for example - are handed. Only the correct hand works, in the same way that a right hand does not fit a left-hand glove.\n\nIn this case, the osmium compound JPC11, with sodium formate, can selectively produce a molecule of a specific \'handedness\' - thus manipulating how cancer cells grow.\n\nDr Coverdale explained:\n\n""The \'handedness\' of molecules is critical in the body. Our hands are near-identical, but are mirror images of each other. The same can be true of molecules, and in some cases, having the wrong handed molecule can have profound biological consequences.\n\n""We believe that manipulation of the \'handedness\' of molecules in cells could provide a new strategy for fighting diseases.""\n\n###\n\nNotes:\n\nThe research, \'Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation by synthetic catalysts in cancer cells\', is published in Nature Chemistry.

The news release focuses on a study published in Nature Chemistry Jan. 8, which found that a compound called JPC11, found in stinging nettle plants and ants, is effective at attacking some kinds of cancer cells. However, while the release explains how JPC11 can attack cancer cells, it does not tell readers of the many hurdles that lie between the current discovery and any possible future use of the compound to fight cancer in humans. The research published in Nature Chemistry reflects only work done testing JPC11 against some types of cancer cells in vitro. In other words, JPC11 has not yet been tested in an animal model, much less begun the lengthy process of clinical trials that are necessary to determine whether it may be used on a large scale by human patients.
The release acknowledges in a quote from a lead researcher that “It will take time to progress from the lab to the clinic” but the caution seems weak in comparison to the claims and speculation made elsewhere in the release, including in the headline.

And, in the case of colds, the probability of a cold was slightly less. The effects seemed to be strongest early on after birth,"" said study senior author Usha Ramakrishnan, an associate professor in the Hubert Department of Global Health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nRamakrishnan said it\'s probably too soon to recommend routine use of DHA supplements for pregnant women, because the findings weren\'t ""dramatic."" But, she added that the supplements did appear to be safe for pregnant women to take.\n\nResults of the study will be published online on Aug. 1, and are scheduled to appear in the September issue of Pediatrics. The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the March of Dimes Foundation.\n\nOmega 3 fatty acids are a class of nutrients considered essential for neural and retinal development during pregnancy. They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.\n\nTherefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.\n\nMore than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant. Treatment continued at least until the birth of the baby.\n\nRamakrishnan said Mexican women tend to be deficient in DHA, much like many American women are.\n\nThe babies were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and the mothers completed questionnaires about their babies\' health. To aid their recall, the mothers were also asked to keep a diary, recording any illness symptoms.\n\nBabies in the DHA group had a 24 percent drop in the odds of having a combination of cold symptoms at 1 month compared to babies whose mothers were given a placebo. Also at 1 month, babies whose mothers had gotten the DHA supplement had 26 percent shorter duration of cough, 15 percent less time with phlegm and 30 percent shorter duration of wheezing.\n\nAt 3 months, babies in the DHA group were also sick 14 percent less time. And, at 6 months, the babies whose mothers had DHA had shorter duration of fever, runny nose and breathing problems.\n\nAt times, however, babies in the DHA group experienced longer duration of rashes and vomiting, the study authors noted.\n\nRamakrishnan said that it\'s likely that DHA boosts infants\' immune response.\n\nDr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, ""We\'ve been recommending DHA intake in pregnant women for brain and nervous system development, and this study suggests another good reason to take DHA.""\n\nWu recommended that women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should ""start prenatal vitamins and DHA supplements about three months before pregnancy and then continue them throughout the pregnancy.

So, there wasn\'t, \'What could we do differently?\'""\n\nThe couple then learned about a new way to tailor fertility treatments specifically to the DNA of the mother, using a test that can help couples figure out the perfect time for conception, based on that DNA.\n\nABCNews.com\n\nThe Endometrial Receptivity Test uses a tissue sample to look at 238 genes to find out the optimum time for conception, thus increasing the couple\'s chance to conceive.\n\nFor Bilson, that time is two days later than the average woman.\n\nDr. Ilan Tur-Kaspa, an OB-GYN and the director of Chicago\'s Institute for Human Reproduction, described the process as ""personalized medicine.""\n\nABC News\n\n""This is what we are trying to do here by personalized medicine,"" Tur-Kaspa said, adding that you can ""make sure"" that ""the uterus is ready, and optimize a time for implantation.""\n\nThe result: Their beautiful baby Westley, who is now nine months old.\n\n""We\'re so lucky,"" Bilson said. ""We\'re so blessed.""\n\nABC News\n\nOB-GYN Dr. Jessica Shepherd told ""GMA"" that this breakthrough new treatment is very exciting to the medical community because it offers another avenue for women who have recurrent miscarriages to potentially get pregnant, when it is something they never thought they could look forward to.\n\nThe new technique works by having a doctor take a sample of the women\'s endometrial tissue, which you can get DNA from, and from that DNA you can tell what part of the cycle is prime time to take the fertilized egg and implant it via IVF, Shepherd added.\n\nShepherd said that the ideal candidates are women who have had three or more miscarriages or women over 40, but emphasized that the test is not for everyone and infertility is a spectrum.\n\nOne risk of the procedure many women may not take into account is the emotional effects of it not working and you still miscarrying, Shepherd said. It is a new process and important to go over the risks of the procedure -- which can vary per person -- with your health care provider.']","Breakthrough? Based on the story of one patient?  We’re told the procedure hasn’t been done often. But how often, and what happened to the other women?","ABC News pursues a story idea they heard about in a special issue of National Geographic magazine and calls it a “breakthrough fertility test.” But what ABC delivers is one satisfied success story. We’re given no broader context other than the vague reference to the fact that it hasn’t been tried “on many” women. How many? And with what results? How can the audience judge whether the breakthrough label fits in this case? They can’t.

The findings could be a significant step in treating people with resistant hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, the researchers said.\n\nThe technique -- called catheter-based renal denervation -- is minimally invasive. In it, doctors use a catheter inserted through the artery in the groin, which sends radio waves burning away nerve tissue around the arteries that feed the kidneys.\n\nThe procedure destroys nerves that help control and filter salt in the body and may be overactive in patients with high blood pressure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved its use.\n\nThe study was funded by medical device maker Medtronic. The findings were published Dec. 17 in the journal Circulation.\n\n""This is a very promising approach for managing medication-resistant hypertension,"" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n""High blood pressure is a major contributor to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and [kidney] failure,"" said Fonarow, who was not involved in the study. ""Despite the availability of a number of effective medications, many patients with hypertension have not achieved adequate control of their blood pressure. There is thus an important, but currently unmet, need for additional therapies to effectively control hypertension.""\n\nFor the study, an international team lead by Dr. Murray Esler, professor and senior director of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, assigned 35 patients to renal denervation and compared them to 47 patients who had already had the procedure.\n\nAll the patients suffered from drug-resistant hypertension. Their systolic blood pressure -- the top number in a blood-pressure reading -- remained dangerously high at 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above despite having taking three or more drugs to control blood pressure, the researchers noted.\n\nEsler\'s team found that more than 83 percent of those who had denervation treatment before had a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after six months and almost 79 percent maintained the reduction at 12 months.\n\nThe 35 patients in this phase of the study had similar results to the initial group. Almost 63 percent of these patients saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more six months after treatment.\n\nFonarow noted: ""In all, reductions in systolic blood-pressure levels on the order of 25 to 30 mmHg were achieved and maintained without any loss in efficacy.""\n\nThe procedure is safe as well as effective, the study authors said.\n\n""Participants\' kidneys were not damaged or functionally impaired,"" Esler said in a journal news release. ""We also found no ill effects on long-term health from the procedure.""\n\nWhether this technique might be useful in treating less severe high blood pressure hasn\'t yet been tested. If it is applicable, it could mean patients need not take blood-pressure drugs, Esler suggested.\n\nAnother expert, however, said that scenario is likely overoptimistic.\n\n""Hypertension is a hard disease to treat because there are so many things that go into getting blood pressure under control,"" said Dr. Varinder Singh, chairman of cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""There\'s lifestyle and diet, there is getting to the right doses of medications, there are adherence issues. So anything that will help patients get their goals is exciting.""\n\nEven with this technique, people will most likely still have to take blood-pressure medications, Singh said. ""You may have to take less medication and you may have to take lower doses of medication, but we all expect that patients will still have to take some medication,"" he said.\n\nSingh also noted that although this procedure is used in other countries it is not yet approved in the United States.\n\nFonarow added: ""While this study demonstrates that renal denervation provides sustained reduction of blood pressure up to one year and appears safe, additional studies with longer-term follow-up are needed.""\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, more than 78 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure, which is blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nAmong these adults, about 9 percent have resistant hypertension, which means that even taking three or more medications to control their blood pressure, it remains higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about hypertension, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","While the story gets a relatively high grade, it got unsatisfactory scores on 3 of our most important criteria:  costs, harms, and evidence.","At least  this story was better than the Toronto Star story, which led, “In what’s being described as a potential public health miracle….” and better than some recent Star Tribune stories on renal denervation.

Why doctors need to distinguish and how they might do so,"['Alzheimer’s disease now affects an estimated 5.5 million Americans, and after decades of feverish work, researchers have so far failed to find a treatment that halts or reverses the inexorable loss of memory, function and thinking ability that characterize this feared illness.\n\nBut researchers have been quite successful at devising ways to diagnose Alzheimer’s earlier and earlier. And that capability has emerged alongside evidence of a tantalizing possibility: that if you can catch the disease early enough — ideally when symptoms of confusion or memory loss are just emerging, or before — some therapies already in hand might essentially halt its progress.\n\nFor anyone who detects some mental slippage and wonders, “Is it Alzheimer’s?” the current state of dementia research raises a very real, and very wrenching, dilemma: If I can know, do I want to know?\n\nThat is, if it’s Alzheimer’s disease, would I do anything differently? Would there be some benefit in knowing for my loved ones, for myself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoctors and insurers, including the federal government, which administers Medicare, are asking some variants of the same questions: If an effective test, which costs between $3,000 and $5,000 a shot, can diagnose dementia early, and distinguish Alzheimer’s from other forms of dementia, should it be recommended to patients with cognitive concerns and routinely covered by their insurance? Would it make patients’ lives better, or lower the cost of their care?\n\nNewly unveiled research results are bringing some clarity to such deliberations. And other new research, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, proposes a new diagnostic tool that may be able to detect Alzheimer’s, and distinguish it from another form of dementia, more simply and cheaply than does the best test now available.\n\nAt the Alzheimer’s Assn. International Conference in London last week, researchers reported their preliminary findings from a trial that is testing the impact of diagnostic testing for Alzheimer’s disease on nearly 19,000 Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nAll of these study participants — largely people in their 70s, all with a diagnosis of either “mild cognitive impairment” or atypical dementia — are living with the unconfirmed suspicion that they have Alzheimer’s. The study is underwritten by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Alzheimer’s Assn. It set out to find out whether knowing — getting the costly test that would offer either confirmation or reprieve — would change the way that patients with cognitive troubles are treated, or the way that they plan their lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe preliminary results suggested it did. After getting the results of a PET brain scan to detect and measure amyloid deposits, which are the key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, roughly two-thirds of the subjects saw their medication regimens changed or were counseled differently by their doctors about what to expect.\n\nThat new information may have guided family caregivers in planning their own futures, or prodded patients to make financial decisions and power-of-attorney assignments sooner. Some who learned that they did not have Alzheimer’s discontinued medications that can have unpleasant side effects. Others learned they do have Alzheimer’s and decided to enroll in clinical trials that will test new drugs.\n\nA second study presented in London analyzed data from several studies, and found that in a large population of research participants with cognitive concerns, brain amyloid PET scans led to a change in diagnosis in approximately 20% of cases.\n\n“People should know what’s coming,” said Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer’s Assn. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has given amyloid scans a provisional approval, meaning they do not routinely pay for them. The results may guide the agency to rethink its position, she added.\n\nThe PET scan bore bad news for Ken Lehmann, who enrolled last year in the IDEAS trial, short for Imaging Dementia — Evidence for Amyloid Scanning. After his long, slow decline that has flummoxed doctors, Lehmann’s brain scan clearly showed he has Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nThe certainty that has brought has been a long time coming. When Lehmann began withdrawing from friends, forgetting to pay bills and having trouble following conversations, he was just 58. Now, he’s 80.\n\nKen had always been considered a “Renaissance man” — a furniture company executive who rebuilt Porsches, played basketball and loved to entertain friends, said his wife, Mary Margaret Lehmann. But as years passed, his judgment seemed off. He would lose track of points he was making, and sometimes of where he was at.\n\nIt would take the loss of their home and a business bankruptcy for the Lehmanns to demand answers to what was going on. In 2009, they moved from Sacramento to Edina, Minn., to live with a daughter. And there, at last, they found a neurologist who, despite initial skepticism (“but he presents so well!” the doctor proclaimed), diagnosed dementia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the Lehmanns and many patients and families like them — as well as for neurologists — that diagnosis is often just the beginning of a deeper mystery.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is the most feared and most common form of dementia, accounting for between 60% and 80% of all dementia cases diagnosed. But at least seven other forms of dementia, and dementia linked to the movement disorder Parkinson’s disease, can cause loss of memory, reasoning, judgment and the ability to speak, comprehend and care for oneself.\n\nTo the estimated 16 million Americans living with some form of cognitive impairment, telling the difference could make a significant difference. Dementia forms with different origins progress differently (or sometimes not at all). They respond best to different medications, and will come to require different levels of care and treatment. Some (though not Alzheimer’s) can even be reversed with treatment.\n\nBeing able to distinguish which form of dementia a patient has should help doctors and caregivers to make better choices.\n\nBut it’s a question that until recently could be answered only after death. At that point, a postmortem examination of the brain could be done to look for the built-up clumps and tangles of beta-amyloid proteins, the overall shrinkage, and the loss of neurons in the brain’s hippocampus that are, collectively, the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.\n\nNo more. Improved medical imaging technologies developed over the last decade have made it possible to peer inside the brain of a living patient, detect and measure the accumulation of beta-amyloid, and make a definitive diagnosis.\n\nIn 2012, the Food and Drug Administration took a first step in making such imaging possible, giving its blessing to the imaging agent florbetapir F18, which binds to amyloid aggregates in the brain and allows a PET scan to be used to make the diagnosis. In 2013, two new imaging agents won FDA approval, and new imaging agents and techniques promise ever more precise means to visualize and diagnose Alzheimer’s in the brain.\n\nOn Wednesday, research published in the journal Neurology suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation, a technique that can selectively turn up or down activity in different parts of the brain, could prove useful in distinguishing between Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn many ways, Ken Lehmann’s symptoms fit neatly into a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. A form of cognitive impairment that typically becomes evident earlier than most cases of Alzheimer’s, FTD often affects judgment, personality and verbal communication. This form of dementia progresses as inexorably as does Alzheimer’s. But its typical course differs slightly.\n\nAs an enrollee in the IDEAS trial, Lehmann was prepared to learn what it was he had.\n\n“I had come to the conclusion they just don’t know,” said Lehmann, now 80, from his home in Minnesota. “In seven years, my journey of decline has been very miniscule, and they don’t know why.”\n\nIt turns out, he added, “I have all the biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nOnce he and his wife learned that, they stepped up their preparations for further decline. And they redoubled their efforts to do things that bring joy, and that may slow Ken’s decline as well.\n\nThey follow a diet rich in fatty fish, healthful fats and fruits and vegetables, and Ken does woodworking. He also sings in a Minneapolis chorus, Giving Voice, with other dementia patients. He has regained a long-lost ability to read music.\n\n“Just not knowing is very disconcerting,” says Mary Margaret, who is her husband’s principal caregiver. “I don’t know what the timeline is, but I now know what the needs are, in terms of financial and legal needs and end-of-life issues. Those all need to be planned for ahead of time, and now we have all of that in place. To me, that’s a safety net.”\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\n@LATMelissaHealy\n\nMORE IN SCIENCE\n\nCTE was nearly ubiquitous among former NFL players who donated their brains to science\n\nTo preserve mental acuity into old age, experts suggest focusing on these three things\n\nFake news about statins is discouraging the use of these life-saving drugs, expert warns\n\nPlastic trash could top 13 billion tons by 2050.

This Los Angeles Times story broaches the tricky terrain of improving dementia and Alzheimer’s diagnostics in a world where there are no treatments that effectively stop or reverse the disease. Still, researchers want to know how doctors and patients might change their treatment decisions with more refined knowledge that expensive PET scans can provide. The story explores three new studies within that frame with care. And yet, the findings were described only in very general terms, and the story doesn’t discuss the downsides of this screening test (such as the risk of a false positive result).

More than 1.8 million smokers attempted to quit smoking because of the nine-week-long 2014 Tips From Former Smokers ( Tips ) campaign. An estimated 104,000 Americans quit smoking for good as a result of the 2014 campaign. The survey results are published in the March 24 release of the journal Preventing Chronic Disease.\n\nUnlike the 2012 campaign, which aired for 12 consecutive weeks, the 2014 campaign aired in two phases, from February 3 to April 6 and from July 7 to September 7. Phase 1 of the 2014 campaign ran ads primarily from the 2012 and 2013 campaigns; Phase 2 contained new ads. Those new ads featured people and their struggles with smoking-related health issues, including cancer, gum disease, premature birth, and stroke caused by smoking combined with HIV. About 80 percent of U.S. adult cigarette smokers who were surveyed reported seeing at least one television ad from Phase 2 of the 2014 campaign.\n\n“CDC’s Tips campaign has helped at least 400,000 smokers quit smoking for good since 2012,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. “Tips is also extremely cost-effective and a best buy, saving both lives and money. With a year-round campaign we could save even more lives and money.”\n\nTips, the first federally funded anti-smoking paid media campaign, features former smokers talking about their smoking-related illnesses. Smoking-related diseases cost the United States more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct health care costs and more than $156 billion in lost productivity.\n\n“The Tips campaign is an important counter measure to the $1 million that the tobacco industry spends each hour on cigarette advertising and promotion,” said Corinne Graffunder, Dr.P.H., director of CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health. “The money spent in one year on Tips is less than the amount the tobacco industry spends on advertising and promotion in just 3 days.”\n\nThe most recent Surgeon General’s Report, The Health Consequences of Smoking—50 Years of Progress, called for airing effective messages such as the Tips ads with high frequency and exposure for 12 months a year for a decade or more. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States, killing about 480,000 Americans each year.\n\nFor every American who dies from a smoking-related disease, about 30 more suffer at least one serious illness from smoking. And while the percentage of American adults who smoke is at the lowest level since the CDC began tracking such data, there are still an estimated 40 million adult smokers in the U.S. Surveys show about 70 percent of all smokers want to quit, and research shows quitting completely at any age has significant health benefits.\n\nTips ads encourage smokers to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or to visit www.cdc.gov/tips to view the personal stories from the campaign. The website includes detailed assistance developed by the National Cancer Institute to support smokers trying to quit. For more information on the Tips campaign, including profiles of the former smokers, other campaign resources, and links to the ads, visit www.cdc.gov/tips.\n\n###\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESexternal icon']","This news release, exploring the impact of a federally funded anti-smoking ad campaign, is strong in some areas, weaker in others.","CDC Tips ad campaign features advice from former smokers
This news release focuses on a recent study that evaluates the effectiveness of a 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) educational advertising campaign called “Tips From Former Smokers” (Tips) that aimed to encourage and help cigarette smokers quit smoking. The release highlights the health risks associated with smoking and the estimated effectiveness of the ad campaign. The release also argues that the Tips campaign was a cost-effective means of helping people quit smoking. It provides some good background data on the health-related costs of smoking as well as estimates on how many people were reached through the ad campaign. However, the release does not give readers a hard number on the campaign’s cost.  It would also have been good to know how the effectiveness of the Tips campaign compared to other “quit smoking” efforts.

Almost immediately, he began producing the missing clotting factor. Several weeks later, after he dropped a heavy box on his shin, he watched a bruise develop and shrink within hours. “Are you kidding me?” he thought. “Life's easy if this is what happens.”\n\nKonduros, 53, who runs a bakery and cafe in southeastern Ontario, is one of 10 men in an early-stage trial sponsored by Spark Therapeutics. (The disorder is much more common in men than women.) On Wednesday, researchers reported that a single intravenous infusion of Spark's novel gene therapy enabled patients to safely produce sufficient clotting factor to prevent dangerous bleeding episodes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe treatment also “nearly universally eliminated” the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. And its effects lasted; after a year and a half, the longest patient follow-up, the therapy was continuing to work.\n\nThe results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent “another example of the gene-therapy renaissance,” Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. He said the data suggests that the treatment ultimately might provide an “ideal cure” for hemophilia B.\n\nStill, he noted, the study has some limitations. The follow-up period was relatively short, from 28 to 78 weeks in the new report; longer-term studies are needed to prove safety and effectiveness over extended periods. In addition, he said, researchers need to find ways to provide the therapy to a broader group of people, including children, and to figure out how to reduce the costs involved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe researchers presented earlier findings on the gene therapy a year ago at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting, but the latest data covers a larger patient group and a longer time period.\n\nThe hemophilia gene therapy is one of several being tested for conditions including sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease. The one-time treatments seek to fight the disease by adding correct copies of a patient's defective genes. If approved, such treatments are expected to command stratospheric prices. For example, a separate Spark gene therapy for a rare type of childhood blindness, which is on track for Food and Drug Administration clearance soon, could cost $1 million per patient for infusions in both eyes, according to some Wall Street analysts.\n\nStill, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings. Porteus noted in his editorial that the hemophilia therapy resulted in savings of about $200,000 a year per patient because of the elimination of clotting-factor infusions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther experts also were impressed by the results. The hemophilia study “is small but very promising, and it gives me the sense that gene therapy for hemophilia B is going to be at our disposal in no time, maybe a few years from now,” said Aric Parnes, who is associate director of the Boston Hemophilia Center at the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and wasn't involved in the study. “One of the key things is, how long will the treatment last? Does it wane over time? So far, with a full year, it doesn’t look like that is happening.”\n\nLindsey George, the lead investigator and a hematologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that nine of the 10 men in the trial didn't experience any bleeding episodes after the gene therapy treatment. The one patient who needed clotting factor because of bleeding used 91 percent less than before, she said.\n\n“People were planning their lives around hemophilia, and now they are doing activities that they weren't before,” George said. “One man who came in a wheelchair is now out of a wheelchair and is coaching Little League.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPeople with hemophilia B inherit a gene mutation on the X chromosome that interferes with their ability to produce normal levels of blood-clotting factor IX. (Because women have two copies of the X chromosomes, the other one can compensate, so they may carry the disease but not suffer from it.) Bleeding episodes — which can result from injury or occur spontaneously — can cause extensive damage and be life threatening.\n\nThe therapy developed by Spark, a biotech company spun off from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2013, involves a bioengineered gene designed to prompt the body to produce increased levels of a different clotting factor. The gene is transported to the liver, where clotting factor is made, by a harmless virus called an adeno-associated viral vector. For the current trial, which is being funded by Spark and Pfizer, researchers used a clotting factor that is 8 to 10 times as strong as the normal version. The stronger factor is called Factor IX-Padua, because it was discovered in 2009 in an Italian family.\n\nPatients produced clotting-factor levels that were enough to allow blood to clot but not to spur an undesirable immune-system response, the researchers said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD""]",Whether this particular treatment revolutionizes the landscape for hemophilia B sufferers will remain an open question for some years–and the story should have emphasized that more.,"iStock / Getty Images Plus
A small, early-stage study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a single intravenous infusion of a novel bioengineered gene therapy treatment helped spare nine of 10 hemophilia B sufferers from repeated injections of blood-clotting factor to prevent debilitating bleeding episodes.
This well-written story shares that information carefully and clearly. However, more details about the years-long road ahead for this treatment’s development and about possible ties between the researchers and the funders would have made the piece stronger.
Complicating the care taken by the reporter, however, is a glaring headline that promises much more than this small study can deliver (“Gene therapy makes a big advance treating hemophilia B blood disorder”).

There are no previously approved therapies for TRAPS or HIDS/MKD.\n\n“For the first time, patients with TRAPS and HIDS/MKD, two painful and life altering diseases, have access to a treatment that may help improve their quality of life,” said Badrul Chowdhury, M.D., Ph.D, director of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products in FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\nIlaris was previously approved for another periodic fever syndrome called Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) and for active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Health care professionals should review the prescribing information in the labeling for detailed information about the approved uses.\n\nApprovals for the new indications were based on clinical studies, including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data. The most common adverse reactions for these indications are injection site reactions and being more susceptible to catching colds.\n\nIlaris can cause serious side effects, including increased risk of serious infections. Ilaris can lower the immune system’s ability to fight infections. Other serious side effects include decreased ability to fight infections (immunosuppression) and allergic reactions. Patients experiencing any symptoms of an allergic reaction should call their healthcare provider, including: rash, itching and hives, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and dizziness or feeling faint. Patients should not get live vaccines if receiving Ilaris. Patients should not receive Ilaris if they are allergic to canakinumab or any of the ingredients in Ilaris.\n\nIlaris is manufactured and distributed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, of East Hanover, New Jersey.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

A lack of knowledge about cellular pathways critical to the development of dementia, however, has stood in the way of significant clinical advance. But now, researchers at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University (LKSOM) are breaking through that barrier. They show, for the first time in an animal model, that tau pathology - the second-most important lesion in the brain in patients with Alzheimer\'s disease - can be reversed by a drug.\n\n""We show that we can intervene after disease is established and pharmacologically rescue mice that have tau-induced memory deficits,"" explained senior investigator Domenico Praticò, MD, Scott Richards North Star Foundation Chair for Alzheimer\'s Research, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology, and Director of the Alzheimer\'s Center at Temple at LKSOM. The study, published online in the journal Molecular Neurobiology, raises new hope for human patients affected by dementia.\n\nThe researchers landed on their breakthrough after discovering that inflammatory molecules known as leukotrienes are deregulated in Alzheimer\'s disease and related dementias. In experiments in animals, they found that the leukotriene pathway plays an especially important role in the later stages of disease.\n\n""At the onset of dementia, leukotrienes attempt to protect nerve cells, but over the long term, they cause damage,"" Dr. Praticò said. ""Having discovered this, we wanted to know whether blocking leukotrienes could reverse the damage, whether we could do something to fix memory and learning impairments in mice having already abundant tau pathology.""\n\nTo recapitulate the clinical situation of dementia in humans, in which patients are already symptomatic by the time they are diagnosed, Dr. Praticò and colleagues used specially engineered tau transgenic mice, which develop tau pathology - characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, disrupted synapses (the junctions between neurons that allow them to communicate with one another), and declines in memory and learning ability - as they age. When the animals were 12 months old, the equivalent of age 60 in humans, they were treated with zileuton, a drug that inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme.\n\nAfter 16 weeks of treatment, animals were administered maze tests to assess their working memory and their spatial learning memory. Compared with untreated animals, tau mice that had received zileuton performed significantly better on the tests. Their superior performance suggested a successful reversal of memory deficiency.\n\nTo determine why this happened, the researchers first analyzed leukotriene levels. They found that treated tau mice experienced a 90-percent reduction in leukotrienes compared with untreated mice. In addition, levels of phosphorylated and insoluble tau, the form of the protein that is known to directly damage synapses, were 50 percent lower in treated animals. Microscopic examination revealed vast differences in synaptic integrity between the groups of mice. Whereas untreated animals had severe synaptic deterioration, the synapses of treated tau animals were indistinguishable from those of ordinary mice without the disease.\n\n""Inflammation was completely gone from tau mice treated with the drug,"" Dr. Praticò said. ""The therapy shut down inflammatory processes in the brain, allowing the tau damage to be reversed.""\n\nThe study is especially exciting because zileuton is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma. ""Leukotrienes are in the lungs and the brain, but we now know that in addition to their functional role in asthma, they also have a functional role in dementia,"" Dr. Praticò explained.\n\n""This is an old drug for a new disease,"" he added. ""The research could soon be translated to the clinic, to human patients with Alzheimer\'s disease.""\n\n###\n\nOther researchers contributing to the study include Phillip F. Giannopoulos and Jian Chiu at the Alzheimer\'s Center at Temple, LKSOM.\n\nThe research was funded in part by grants from The Wanda Simone Endowment for Neuroscience and the Scott Richards North Star Charitable Foundation.\n\nAbout Temple Health\n\nTemple University Health System (TUHS) is a $2.1 billion academic health system dedicated to providing access to quality patient care and supporting excellence in medical education and research.

TUHS neither provides nor controls the provision of health care. All health care is provided by its member organizations or independent health care providers affiliated with TUHS member organizations. Each TUHS member organization is owned and operated pursuant to its governing documents.']",Use of use of words like “breakthrough” and a phrase suggesting the drug offers “new hope” for patients detract from the cautious aspects of this release.,"This news release from Temple University Health System describes a study in genetically engineered mice showing that an anti-inflammatory asthma drug was able to reverse the impact of particular kinds of brain damage associated with human Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. The drug, an anti-leukotriene steroid called zileuton, is believed to target the biological pathways involved with damage to “tau” nerve cells in the brain. That damage leads to the fiber-like “tangles” that are suspected of sabotaging the chemical signaling between brain cells needed for learning and memory.
We applaud the release for including the words “in mice” in the headline, something that our reviewers have called the university out for previously. The release would have been strengthened by explicitly addressing the long road still to travel between reversal of tau damage in designer mice and a potential treatment to restore spatial or any other kind of memory in people. A quote noting that the work “could soon be translated” to clinical use was buried at the end of the release, but still left a potentially misleading impression. It also does not mention cost or side effects. The use of  use of words like “breakthrough,” and a phrase about “new hope” for patients,  detract from the otherwise balanced release.

Founded in 1957, it struggled for decades to find uses for the product, almost going out of business before licensing the drug to Auxilium in 2004.\n\n“It sort of proves to people that if you really believe in a drug you should never give up,” said Matthew Geller, a biotechnology investment banker who is a member of the BioSpecifics board.\n\nShares of BioSpecifics closed Monday at $27.61, up from $1 as recently as late 2006.\n\nSome people treated with Xiaflex in clinical trials for the Dupuytren’s hand condition said it had made a big difference in their lives, and had allowed them to avoid painful surgery.\n\nPhoto\n\n“When I looked down and saw my finger straightened out, I cried,” said Kenneth Nelson, 65, of Indianapolis. “It was to me just like a miracle.”\n\nXiaflex is an enzyme produced by a gangrene-causing bacterium, Clostridium histolyticum, which uses it to eat away the tissues of its victims. The enzyme, called collagenase, breaks down collagen, a major component of the body’s connective tissue that is found in skin, tendons, cartilage and other organs.\n\nBut collagenase by itself does not cause gangrene. And there are times doctors need to break down collagen, such as when an excess builds up in the hand or penis, causing Dupuytren’s and Peyronie’s. The ailments are named for French surgeons who described the conditions in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe enzyme was first extracted from the bacteria around 1950 by Ines Mandl, a young biochemist at Columbia University. Edwin H. Wegman, a Long Island entrepreneur, learned about Dr. Mandl’s work and set up a company called Advance Biofactures, which later became BioSpecifics, to turn collagenase into a drug.\n\nIn 1965, the company won approval of an ointment containing collagenase for use in removing dead tissue from skin ulcers and burns. The ointment, sold by licensees under the name Santyl, was a modest success, but the company never truly prospered.\n\nSo in the 1970s the company began developing what it thought would be a bigger money-maker, an injectable collagenase. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. Finally, in the early 1990s, two professors of orthopedics at the nearby State University of New York at Stony Brook suggested using the drug for Dupuytren’s.\n\nThe professors, Dr. Lawrence C. Hurst and Marie A. Badalamente, injected the drug into the tails of rats, as a stand-in for human fingers. They found they could dissolve the collagen in tendons, making the tails floppy, without harming nearby nerves and arteries. Then they organized clinical trials in patients and got federal grants to help pay for the work. The professors and Stony Brook will share a royalty of one half of 1 percent of sales of Xiaflex for use in treating Dupuytren’s.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In desperation, Ed Wegman’s son Mark, a top computer scientist at I.B.M., called a childhood friend, Laurence Korn, who had been the chief executive of a successful biotechnology company now known as PDL BioPharma.\n\nWith Dr. Korn’s help, BioSpecifics licensed the drug to Auxilium in a matter of weeks, receiving $5 million initially.\n\nAuxilium was interested because of Peyronie’s disease. It already was selling a gel for men with low testosterone and had learned from urologists about the need for better treatments for bent penises.\n\nPhoto\n\n“From talking with surgeons and patients who have Peyronie’s, neither of them wants to do the surgery,” said Will Sargent, a spokesman for Auxilium.\n\nTwo years ago, the drug giant Pfizer, which sells the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, licensed the European rights to Xiaflex from Auxilium for an initial payment of $75 million. BioSpecifics got $6.4 million of that amount and will receive 8.5 percent of additional payments of up to $410 million that Pfizer might make.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAuxilium sought approval for treating Dupuytren’s first because it was easier to measure success in straightening fingers. But the company hopes to begin late-stage trials of Xiaflex for Peyronie’s disease later this year. In a midstage trial, injections of Xiaflex into the collagen plaque in the penis reduced the curvature. But the drug did not reduce pain or discomfort during intercourse by a statistically significant amount.\n\nWhile collagenase itself is not patented, the companies do have patents on the use of the enzyme to treat Dupuytren’s and Peyronie’s. They are also shielded from competition for seven years under a federal law aimed at spurring development of drugs for rare, or “orphan,” diseases — even though newer estimates suggest these two diseases are not as rare as thought when the drugs were given orphan status.\n\nAuxilium and BioSpecifics hope that the half-century-old collagenase might eventually become as versatile as Botox, another bacterial product. They are looking at uses that range from loosening up immobile “frozen shoulders” to eliminating fat bulges and cellulite.\n\nWith its belated success, BioSpecifics has sold off its ointment business. It now has only five employees and a business of collecting a roughly 11 to 12 percent royalty on sales of Xiaflex.\n\n“We will be a cash machine going forward,” said Thomas L. Wegman, the president and the other son of the company founder. “We don’t have to pay for marketing. We don’t have to pay for manufacturing.”\n\nThe Wegman family — the two sons and the founder’s 75-year-old wife, Toby — controls about 25 percent of the company’s stock.\n\nEd Wegman, the company’s founder, did not live to see the F.D.A. approval, dying at age 87 in 2007. On Feb. 2, the day the drug was approved, one BioSpecifics director sent an e-mail message to the others saying, “Well done. Hope Ed is looking on.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Mandl, the biochemist who first isolated collagenase from the bacteria, is nearing 93. Last year, when BioSpecifics stock rose above $30, she sold the last 1,000 shares she had been given for serving as a consultant to the company over the years.\n\nUnfortunately, she had sold most of her holdings years earlier for a relative pittance. “If I still had what I originally had,” she said. “I’d be very rich.”""]","Five-star effort: A main story and a sidebar that deliver facts, cautious optimism, and balancing issues of costs and potential harms.  ","This story is about the long journey to approval of a new drug called Xiaflex used to treat Dupuytren’s contracture–a condition in which cords of collagen cause fingers to clench involuntarily. While the main story focuses mostly on the financial maneuverings related to the drug’s development, this sidebar provides a very informative overview of the drug’s benefits and risks for patients, costs, and effectiveness compared with other treatments. Overall, an excellent effort – markedly different than an earlier story on this drug by ABC News.com.

Many women with depression faced a difficult decision: continue their medication during pregnancy, potentially putting their child at risk, or jeopardize their own mental health by going off the drugs.\n\nThe FDA advisory pointed to a single study showing a six-fold increased risk of a condition called persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns whose mothers were taking antidepressants.\n\nBut now a new, large-scale study finds that the risk is negligible -- much lower than previously believed, reports CBS Boston\'s Dr. Mallika Marshall.\n\nResearchers at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston looked at 3.8 million pregnant women nationwide and found that those taking popular antidepressants, called SSRIs, did not appear to be at significantly increased risk of having a baby with pulmonary hypertension.\n\n""The risk increase of taking antidepressants late in pregnancy, if present, is much more modest than previous studies have found,"" says Krista Huybrechts, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital. ""So for women with severe debilitating depression that is not responsive to other non-pharmacological treatments, this should be reassuring information.""\n\nIt\'s certainly reassuring news for Dr. Katherine Economy, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at the Brigham who cares for many pregnant women on antidepressants.\n\n""They take them because they have a disease that impacts their daily life,"" Economy says. ""And for many women, they cannot get through their daily activities, getting out of bed, taking a shower, and preparing food for themselves. So for many of these women, these medications are life-saving and life-altering.""\n\nDr. Economy warns patients about the potential risks like withdrawal in the newborn and a small risk of heart defects, but says for many women, the worst time to stop their medications is at the end of pregnancy when postpartum depression becomes a concern.\n\n""My basic message is that, overall, there may be some slight risks associated with the medication, but in balancing risks and benefits for most women, I would suggest they stay on their medication,"" she said.']",The story about antidepressants in pregnancy could have done a better job of explaining the FDA’s “six-fold increase” in risk to newborns and showing the actual rates observed in the new study.,"This story covers a new study that partially uproots a concern that doctors and pregnant women alike have faced since before 2006: taking certain antidepressants during pregnancy. Called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, these drugs can alleviate common symptoms of depression that some pregnant women may grapple with. The text story and accompanying video touch on the quality of evidence (i.e. a huge sample size of millions of women), and the story appropriately highlights the slight risks to newborns in pregnant women who take SSRIs. Commentary from an expert not involved with the study adds important context to the coverage. The story could have done a better job of explaining the FDA’s concerns about a “six-fold increase” in risk to newborns and showing the actual rates observed in the new study. More information on the harms of not taking SSRIs, as well as potential alternatives to SSRIs, would also have been welcome. A HealthDay story on the same study provided more of the information that we were looking for.

The trial was funded by Pfizer.\n\nWomen in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group took a median of 9.5 months to progress, as measured by CT and MRI scans, compared with 4.6 months in the placebo group.\n\nSome 67 per cent of the 347 women in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group showed clinical benefit - either a reduction in tumour size or control of disease for at least six months - compared with 40 per cent of the 174 women in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.\n\nSome 19 per cent in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group had a decrease in tumour size compared with 9 per cent in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.\n\nThe study also aimed to assess whether cancers with particular genetic traits responded less well or better to the combination than others.\n\nMutations to the gene PIK3CA represent the most common genetic event in breast cancer, and mutations in the gene are associated with a shorter response to hormone therapy.\n\nThe research showed that using \'liquid biopsies\' that measure cancer DNA circulating in the blood to detect PIK3CA, and tests for blood hormone levels, the palbociclib combination worked in all types of hormone-receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.\n\nPalbociclib is a first-in-class drug - with a different mechanism of action to other approved drugs - which simultaneously blocks two proteins called CDK4 and CDK6 in cancer cells. It causes less severe side-effects than traditional chemotherapy.\n\nIn the trial, severe side-effects caused by the combination were rare. Many women (81 per cent on the palbociclib arm) had a drop in their white blood cell count, but this rarely led to serious symptoms.\n\nStudy co-lead author Dr Nicolas Turner, Team Leader in Molecular Oncology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:\n\n""Our research underlines the effectiveness of palbociclib with fulvestrant in metastatic breast cancer and, importantly, demonstrates its benefit in all types of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We hope our results lead to the adoption of this drug combination in breast cancer, where it delays the need to start chemotherapy by an average of nine months.\n\n""Our study also sends a powerful message that in combining new drugs in innovative trials we can find better options for women with advanced breast cancer. Chemotherapy can add several months to life but it comes at a cost of often life-limiting side effects, and we need alternative treatments that are better tolerated to treat patients with advanced breast cancer.""\n\nProfessor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:\n\n""If we\'re going to drive further improvements in survival from cancer, it\'s essential that we find ways of prolonging life in people whose cancers have evolved and become resistant to treatment. This trial is an exciting example of one of the most promising approaches to overcoming drug resistance, by combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to block off cancer\'s escape routes. It\'s very encouraging to see such substantial delays to cancer progression.""\n\n###\n\nNotes to editors\n\nFor more information please contact Henry French on 020 7153 5582 or henry.french@icr.ac.uk.

The release provides data on the drug combo’s effect on time to progression, which may be a clinically important measure. But women also want to know if it will help them live longer, and this news release doesn’t address that. The release has some strong points, including clear reporting and useful information on how the drug combination compares with alternative therapies. Its main weaknesses were downplaying the side effects and omitting the cost of these very pricey drugs.
[Editor’s Note/Correction: Following publication of this review, a public relations representative that works with AstraZeneca pointed out that the drugs are co-administered, not combined into one drug. That wasn’t made clear in the news release which referred simply to “the combination” or a “combination of two drugs.” We’ve since revised the summary text to read that the study refers to a combination of drugs rather than a combination drug.
In addition, the news release didn’t include the drugs’ costs, so we did an online search in order to give readers a sense of the price. We provided reputable sources for the cost information. AstraZeneca’s representative disputed the cost estimate of $11,899/month and said the wholesale cost for fulvestrant 500 MG is $1,845/month. That cost appears to be accurate whereas the source we referenced was incorrect. We’ve updated that section of the review accordingly.  Cost to patients will vary according to their insurance coverage.
We’ve also revised the cost section to reflect that a source noted that palbociclib could “potentially” be one of the top 10 most expensive drugs, not that it currently exists on such a list.]

Freedman of The Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa, the trial included 24 participants who were followed for up to 13 years. The $6.47 million trial was funded by the MS Society of Canada and its affiliated Multiple Sclerosis Scientific Research Foundation. The research was also supported by The Ottawa Hospital Foundation, The Ottawa Hospital Department of Medicine and Canadian Blood Services.\n\n""Our trial is the first to show the complete, long-term suppression of all inflammatory activity in people with MS,"" said Dr. Atkins, a stem cell transplant physician and scientist at The Ottawa Hospital, and associate professor at the University of Ottawa. ""This is very exciting. However, it is important to note that this therapy can have serious side effects and risks, and would only be appropriate for a small proportion of people with very active MS. People with MS who have had significant disability for a long time would likely not benefit.""\n\n""This procedure should be considered as a treatment option for people with early, aggressive MS,"" said Dr. Freedman, a neurologist and senior scientist at The Ottawa Hospital and professor at the University of Ottawa. ""Although this trial was relatively small, it was intensive, with the longest prospective follow-up of any such treatment group to date, and that is what makes the results so convincing. However, this is a very complex procedure that should only be performed at very specialized centres with expertise in both the management of MS patients and blood stem cell transplantation.""\n\nMS affects approximately 2.3 million people around the world, causing symptoms that range from blurred vision to extreme fatigue to partial or complete paralysis. It occurs when the immune system - which normally protects against foreign disease-causing organisms - mistakenly attacks the body\'s own central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. Early in the disease, people often experience temporary episodes of worsening symptoms accompanied by active inflammation in the brain (called relapses), whereas later on, disease progression is inevitable.\n\nThe trial evaluated a treatment called immunoablation and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (IAHSCT). The procedure begins by giving a person medication to coax their hematopoietic stem cells to migrate from their bone marrow into their blood. These stem cells are then collected from the blood, purified and frozen. Then, high doses of chemotherapy drugs are used to eliminate the person\'s diseased immune system. The stem cells are then transplanted back into the same person, so that they can give rise to a new immune system that has no ""memory"" of the previous pattern of attacking the central nervous system.\n\nThe trial included 24 participants with aggressive, relapsing MS. They were followed for anywhere between four and 13 years after treatment (with a median post-treatment follow up of 6.7 years).\n\nAfter the treatment:\n\nNot a single participant experienced a clinical relapse (zero relapses in 179 patient-years), whereas before treatment, the participants experienced an average of 1.2 relapses per year (167 relapses in 146 patient-years).\n\nNot a single new active inflammatory lesion could be detected in the brains of any of the participants (zero lesions on 327 MRI scans) whereas before the treatment, participants had 188 lesions on 48 scans.\n\nNot a single participant required MS-specific drugs to control their disease.\n\n70 percent of participants experienced a complete stop in disease progression.\n\nThe average rate of brain shrinkage, typically a measure that correlates with MS progression, returned to levels associated with normal aging.\n\n40 percent of participants experienced some lasting reversal of symptoms such as vision loss, muscle weakness and balance problems.']",Appropriately cautious release provides most of the right details on multiple sclerosis therapy advance.,"This is nearly a textbook example about how a news release can take mixed results from a clinical study and both highlight the promising findings while illuminating the harms and other issues, too. The only glaring omission here was any mention of the costs of treatment, which likely are considerable.
The release discusses a clinical trial of a therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) that includes destruction of the immune system with chemotherapy and reconstitution of the immune system with previously preserved patient’s blood stem cells. The study is of 24 subjects followed from 4 to 13 years.

Symptoms include weakness, muscle stiffness and difficulty thinking--a phenomenon often referred to as ""brain fog."" MS affects an estimated 2.5 million people worldwide, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.\n\nDamage to the thalamus, a structure in the middle of the brain that acts as a kind of information hub, and its connections with other parts of the brain play an important role in the cognitive dysfunction many MS patients experience.\n\nResearchers led by Laura De Giglio, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry at Sapienza University in Rome, recently studied the effects of a video game-based cognitive rehabilitation program on the thalamus in patients with MS. They used a collection of video games from the Nintendo Corporation, called Dr. Kawashima\'s Brain Training, which train the brain using puzzles, word memory and other mental challenges. The games are based on the work of Japanese neuroscientist Ryuta Kawashima, M.D.\n\nTwenty-four MS patients with cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to either take part in an eight-week, home-based rehabilitation program--consisting of 30-minute gaming sessions, five days per week--or be put on a wait list, serving as the control group. Patients were evaluated by cognitive tests and by 3-Tesla resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) at baseline and after the eight-week period. Functional imaging when the brain is in its resting state, or not focused on a particular task, provides important information on neural connectivity.\n\n""Functional MRI allows you to study which brain areas are simultaneously active and gives information on the participation of certain areas with specific brain circuits,"" Dr. De Giglio said. ""When we talk about increased connectivity, we mean that these circuits have been modified, increasing the extension of areas that work simultaneously.""\n\nAt follow-up, the 12 patients in the video-game group had significant increases in thalamic functional connectivity in brain areas corresponding to the posterior component of the default mode network, which is one of the most important brain networks involved in cognition. The results provide an example of the brain\'s plasticity, or ability to form new connections throughout life.\n\n""This increased connectivity reflects the fact that video gaming experience changed the mode of operation of certain brain structures,"" Dr. De Giglio said. ""This means that even a widespread and common use tool like video games can promote brain plasticity and can aid in cognitive rehabilitation for people with neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.""\n\nThe modifications in functional connectivity shown in the video game group after training corresponded to significant improvements in test scores assessing sustained attention and executive function, the higher-level cognitive skills that help organize our lives and regulate our behavior.\n\nThe results suggest that video-game-based brain training is an effective option to improve cognitive abilities of patients with MS.\n\nIn the future, the researchers hope to study whether the plasticity induced by video games in MS patients is also related to improvements in other aspects of their daily lives. They also plan to look at how the video game can be integrated into a rehabilitation program together with other rehabilitative techniques.\n\n###\n\n""Multiple Sclerosis: Changes in Thalamic Resting-State Functional Connectivity Induced by a Home-based Cognitive Rehabilitation Program.""

LaRosa, president of the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center in New York City: ""It\'s very preliminary but it\'s important because the last drug out of the barrel of this type was not a success. This looks like a better drug, but it\'s not definitive by any means. Don\'t take this to the bank.""\n\nLaRosa was referring to torcetrapib, which, like anacetrapib, belongs to the class of drugs known as cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors.\n\nA large trial on torcetrapib was killed after investigators found an increased risk of death and other cardiovascular outcomes.\n\n""I would be more excited [about anacetrapib] if I hadn\'t seen what happened to its cousin torcetrapib,"" Weintraub said. ""Torcetrapib raised HDL astoundingly but that was entirely neutralized by the increase in cardiovascular events.""\n\nIn the new trial, anacetrapib actually showed a tendency toward fewer cardiovascular problems and fewer angioplasty or bypass procedures, although the study only lasted 18 months.\n\nIt also didn\'t result in the blood pressure increases that helped doom torcetrapib.\n\nTo assess the safety of the trial, investigators randomly chose 1,623 adults with coronary heart disease who were taking cholesterol-lowering statins to receive either anacetrapib or a placebo for 18 months.\n\nAt the end of six months, LDL cholesterol was cut 81 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) of blood to 45 mg/dl, a reduction of about 40 percent. In the placebo group, LDL levels only declined from 82 mg/dl to 77 mg/dl.\n\nMeanwhile, HDL levels increased from 41 mg/dl of blood to 101 mg/dl in the treatment arm, versus a small jump from 40 mg/dl to 46 mg/dl in the placebo group.\n\n""We have 94 percent confidence that this drug doesn\'t have the harmful effect that torcetrapib had, but we didn\'t prove a reduction in events,"" said Brigham and Women\'s Cannon. ""That will be the subject of a larger study.""\n\nSuch a study is in the works, he added.\n\nDr. Neil Coplan, director of clinical cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, stressed that this was a ""safety trial, not a trial which is saying in any way that people should take these medications nor are the drugs approved.""\n\nStill, he added, ""the trial demonstrated safety and it demonstrated a tremendous effect on altering the lipid profile in a good direction. It\'s very promising but, as the authors note themselves, it\'s a first step.""\n\nExperts are still divided as to whether raising HDL levels will actually result in any meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes.\n\n""Currently, we\'re not convinced that manipulation of HDL matters, though certainly it\'s promising,"" said Weintraub, who added that results should be available relatively soon from other trials exploring the issue. ""The fact that LDL was also reduced also makes it promising.""\n\n""We\'ve never been able to satisfactorily demonstrate that raising HDL actually changes risk,"" added LaRosa.\n\nThe only drug currently available to raise HDL is nyacin.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on understanding your cholesterol levels.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Better than CNN’s story on this same study, HealthDay <span style=""font-family: Arial;"">clearly framed the story around the safety concerns about this new class of drugs that are designed to alter how the body manages cholesterol and avoided promoting premature conclusions about potential health benefits. </span></span>","
 Beginning with the lead and continuing throughout, the story reminded readers of the limitations of this trial and that questions about health benefits will have to wait for the next round of experimentation. However, although this story gives readers a balanced view of what researchers reported, it should have told them that the trial was sponsored by a drug company and that the lead researcher has financial ties to that company and others in the field.

But three weeks later he was suicidal, checking into a mental hospital at his therapist’s urging.\n\nBy collecting the former editor’s DNA with a quick cheek swab, a new genetic test retailing at $3,800 would reveal which depression medications Brown would likely respond well to and those he would not.\n\nRUTLAND, Vt. — For the first time in John R. Brown’s two-decade quest for the right medication to make his brain behave, his psychiatrist offered him hope in the form of what seemed like rock-solid science.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I can’t help but wonder if I should have stuck with the devil I know,’’ Brown now says.\n\nGenetic tests to identify the most effective psychiatric drugs are the hot new technology in the race to create personalized treatments based on people’s DNA. More than 600,000 of these tests have likely been administered in the last three years, based on company websites and research data, to better treat conditions ranging from depression to attention deficit disorder to anxiety. In a nod to the tests’ growing acceptance, the federal Medicare program last year agreed for the first time to pay for the GeneSight test for some depressed patients.\n\nBut a review by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting has found that virtually all the evidence that these psychiatric tests work is based on limited studies funded by the companies themselves or researchers they fund, including all five studies used to promote GeneSight on the company’s website.\n\nThe federal government doesn’t require companies to prove that this and thousands of other tests are accurate before marketing and selling them. Unlike drugs, the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate them, though that may soon change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the testing firms’ research practices also raise questions about potential conflicts of interest. For example, California-based Proove Biosciences provides a full-time employee to administer and run a study on the company’s test at a Littleton, Mass., mental health clinic. It pays clinicians for time spent related to the study, a relationship that could give clinicians an incentive to steer patients to the test — and give the company access to insurance reimbursement for those patients.\n\nPatients also cannot find out for themselves if their doctor stands to gain financially by recommending a personalized medicine test. A public federal database created in 2014 to disclose financial relationships between the health care industry and physicians excludes most genetic tests.\n\n“It is the Wild West,’’ said Mildred Cho, associate director at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, who says there is little published evidence on the effectiveness of drug response tests.\n\nEric Lander, a leader of the Human Genome Project and founding director of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, goes further, saying in a New England Journal of Medicine article earlier this year that the mental health testing company claims are “not harmless and may be quite dangerous.”\n\nIn psychiatry, a field hampered by a lack of definitive tests for conditions and treatments alike, the idea of a genetic test to identify the drugs most likely to be effective is particularly appealing as a way to cut down on the trial-and-error approach to medications that many patients face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the tests do hold promise. The basic science behind them is built on years of solid research — analyzing an individual’s genetic make-up to determine how they may respond to drugs. GeneSight’s test was developed using technology from the respected Mayo Clinic and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.\n\nOfficials at Assurex Health, the Ohio-based company that makes GeneSight, stand behind their product. They make no guarantee that GeneSight will lead doctors to pick the right medicine for patients, but they point to company studies that show it more than doubles the odds they will. Plus, the officials note, the test underwent close review by a Medicare contractor before the agency agreed to pay for the tests.\n\n“Patients do better,’’ said Bryan M. Dechairo, senior vice president of medical affairs and clinical development for Assurex. “We continue to do more studies” to show the test’s value.\n\nThe amount of money at stake is enormous. Psychiatric conditions affect 1 in 4 adults every year and 1 in 5 teens, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Finding a test to more precisely target treatment could help troubled people find help more quickly, cut down on side effects, and save money. It can also make hundreds of millions of dollars for the test makers, which helps explain why at least 15 companies are now ramping up mental health testing.\n\n“It is so much more than just getting the medications right,’’ said Rachel Scott, vice president of clinical research and operations for Pennsylvania-based test maker Genomind. “It is giving patients the opportunity to step outside the stigma of mental illness, for them to see this is their biology — and give their clinician some objective information.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut psychiatric genetics remains in its infancy. Aggressive marketing and a lack of regulation of tests that have a thin scientific foundation have raised concerns for some bioethicists.\n\n“The claims of these companies are weak,’’ said Robert Klitzman, a psychiatrist and bioethicist at Columbia University in New York who had a commentary published last week in a mental health journal calling for vigilance in the marketing of genetic mental health tests.\n\n“Conflicts of interest in the field are major problems,” he said.\n\nPayments from test maker\n\nLast fall, the owners of the New England Center for Mental Health in Littleton, an adult and child clinic, were asked to be part of a research study.\n\nCalifornia-based Proove Biosciences wanted the center to join a national study, aimed in part at better understanding how its tests benefited adults with mental health conditions.\n\nThe company would provide the center with a full-time research assistant stationed in an office behind the reception desk. If a clinician and patient decided a Proove drug metabolism test, which analyzes 69 genetic variants, would be useful, the assistant would take the patient’s DNA with a cheek swab, collect insurance information for Proove to be reimbursed, and administer extensive questionnaires to track how the test worked out over time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We wanted to offer our patients a test that could really help them,’’ said Jessica X. Hennessey, director of operations and management at the Center for Mental Health.\n\nThe center received a one-time payment of $600 from Proove for training and is allowed to bill $150 for each hour of clinical research service and services rendered by Littleton staff members related to the study, according to Ernie Corrigan, a spokesman for the center. The Center for Mental Health has billed Proove a little more than $5,600 since then, Corrigan said.\n\nProove officials and Hennessey said clinicians are never compensated based on the type or number of tests they order, and clinicians do not promote the swab test in any way.\n\n“The tests are only ordered if they are medically necessary,” said Brian Meshkin, Proove’s founder and CEO.\n\nBut the close arrangement raises eyebrows among bioethicists because it can lead to the appearance of clinicians ordering the test to receive compensation for the study.\n\n“There is a big set of ethical concerns here,’’ said Columbia’s Klitzman, after being told about the Littleton study. He said those concerns are especially pronounced if doctors have financial incentives and “order tests that have no clear proven benefit.”\n\nFederal officials are growing increasingly concerned about such research-physician arrangements in the genetic testing field. Late last year, a large study that included psychiatric drug response by New Orleans-based Renaissance RX was shut down after Medicare halted payments and began a review. A Rhode Island doctor also sued the company, charging, in part, that Renaissance RX enrolled ineligible people in order to bill insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Office of the Inspector General for the US Department of Health and Human Services last year singled out compensation agreements related to research studies in a special fraud alert, noting there were growing cases of doctors receiving improper incentives regarding referrals.\n\nMedicare review\n\nThe GeneSight test has gotten the most outside scrutiny among the tests because it faced review by Medicare before the agency agreed to cover it for certain patients with depression.\n\nMedicare contractors were swayed by company-funded studies showing that when these patients took the medications recommended by the test, they had fewer symptoms after eight weeks compared with patients who did not use the test.\n\n“Use of the test to aid in [drug selection] has improved patient responses to treatment by 73 percent . . . these findings support the value of the GeneSight test,’’ according to the coverage decision.\n\nExcitement built in the mental health world that perhaps there was finally a scientific test that could help patients.\n\nBrown heard about the test from his psychiatrist, Susan Gerretson, of the Community Health Centers of the Rutland Region, and found out his federal insurance would pay for it.\n\nWhile his medications of lithium for bipolar disorder and the antidepressant Effexor were holding him steady, he was hardly in a happy place.\n\n“I figured, Why not try it?” he said.\n\n“I figured, Why not try it?” John R. Brown said. Caleb Kenna for The Boston Globe\n\nOf the five medications the test suggested he would respond best to, Brown had never tried two of them. After several months of discussion, Gerretson put him on one of those drugs, Fetzima.\n\nEven without the new drug, Brown says it was a challenging time: He turned 40, his old girlfriend called, and he quarreled with his mother.\n\nBut Fetzima “was a factor’’ in his breakdown, he believes. He paused during an interview this summer at the Brattleboro Retreat, a mental health treatment center, and gave a wry smile. “It sure didn’t help.”\n\nGerretson declined to talk specifically about Brown’s case, citing privacy concerns. But she said in an e-mail that she believes GeneSight can be helpful as long as a doctor fully understands a patient’s history and conducts his or her own research.\n\n“I never believe what sales representatives try to sell me,’’ she wrote.\n\nYet critics of these tests say it’s impossible for doctors — or anyone else — to truly evaluate many of the tests. GeneSight’s proprietary formula for interpreting genetic information has never been independently assessed. The test examines genes well-known to play a role in antidepressant response, but it adds others not suppported by the same level of evidence, some researchers say.\n\nRobert Howland, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, wrote a paper last year concluding that the makers of the GeneSight test have overstated the findings of their studies, making outside review more urgent.\n\n“Independent assessment . . . of the GeneSight test is necessary to overcome the appearance of bias,’’ said Howland.\n\nBut Assurex’s Dechairo said if the company didn’t do the research, no one would. The company has 12 ongoing studies not only for depression, he said, but for bipolar disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia and other medical issues.\n\nTo reach patients, the company markets its tests to the psychiatry world, in part by paying psychiatrists and nurses to talk favorably about their test to peers. The practice is not new in medicine, but, unlike the drug industry, most genetic test makers need not disclose which doctors they pay because they’re not FDA-regulated.\n\nCatherine Poulos, a psychiatric nurse practitioner at East End Mental Health in Hampton Bays, N.Y., advertises the GeneSight test on her website, saying it allows her practice “to use the right drug at the right dose.” But nowhere does it say on the site that she is paid to speak favorably to peers about the test; a patient would have to look at her Linkedin profile to see that. Poulos declined to speak on the record to NECIR.\n\nBut some consultants who use the tests say they do so because they believe in it, not because they get paid.\n\n“It adds clarity,’’ said Chris Bojrab, a psychiatrist and president of Indiana Health Group, a large behavioral health practice and a GeneSight consultant. He discloses his financial relationship with GeneSight on his website.\n\nAn FDA loophole\n\nThe FDA loophole that allows unregulated tests on the market dates back more than three decades to when the FDA began regulating diagnostic tests. At the time, the agency exempted what was then a small group of tests that were developed, manufactured, and used in a single lab, such as in a hospital.\n\nStarting in the mid-2000s, for-profit companies have used the exemption to develop thousands of complex genetic tests now in the marketplace without FDA review.\n\nThe FDA announced plans last year to regulate these tests over the next nine years. However, there is no timeline to finalize the rules, according to an FDA spokeswoman, and the process is likely to take years.\n\nCommercial labs and academic institutions are pushing back against regulation, arguing the rules will stifle innovation and delay life-saving tests getting to patients. Regardless of the outcome of the fight, many academic scientists say this new era in testing needs independent study. They question if the tests are adding unnecessary costs to health care.\n\n“These companies look at a very small subset of a very large number of factors’’ that go into treating patients, said Bruce Cohen, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and director of the program for neuropsychiatric research at McLean Hospital in Belmont. “People are making decisions based on unproven tests.”\n\nBrown’s decision was to go back to old medications. For him, the GeneSight test felt more like “a cool piece of science fiction” than a breakthrough. Still living in his mother’s house, he remains determined to rebuild his life.\n\n“I’m going to have to figure it out another way,” he said.']",This is a solid look at an emerging and important topic.,"This story, originally reported by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and published in partnership with the Boston Globe, describes the history and ethical implications of a loophole allowing genetic tests to bypass FDA approval before doctors prescribe them. Specifically, it outlines concerns regarding the use of genetic testing to help psychiatrists identify which drugs may work best for a patient with mental illness. The story evaluates the research that genetic testing companies use to demonstrate the effectiveness of their tests — and reports that most of these studies are funded or conducted by the companies themselves. The story makes clear that using these genetic tests to guide decisions on prescribing drugs poses risks for patients. The article overall is very well-researched and covers an emerging and important topic.

Nocturnal hot flashes are among the most problematic because they can contribute to poor sleep.\n\nA new study shows that electro-acupuncture may be effective in providing some relief. The study is being published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCompared with women who undergo natural menopause, women with breast cancer are at a greater risk of experiencing hot flashes, partially as a result of the premature menopause that results from chemotherapy and surgery, as well as estrogen deficiency caused by the use of breast cancer treatments such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. It is estimated that by the year 2020 there will be nearly six million breast cancer survivors in the United States.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from a randomized, controlled trial involving 58 breast cancer survivors experiencing bothersome hot flashes. They compared the benefits of using electro-acupuncture (the application of a pulsating electric current) to prescribing gabapentin, an anti-seizure medication frequently prescribed to treat sleep disturbances related to hot flashes. The study showed electro-acupuncture to be comparable to, if not better than, gabapentin in helping to reduce hot flash severity and frequency and improving overall sleep quality (including falling asleep faster and fewer sleep disruptions). Although it is not exactly understood how acupuncture affects sleep, it has been shown to affect a number of neurotransmitters associated with sleep, such as serotonin and melatonin.\n\nPoor sleep is particularly bothersome for breast cancer survivors experiencing nighttime hot flashes because it has been shown to increase levels of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Although electro-acupuncture produced significant sleep improvements, researchers noted that sleep quality for the participants was still not as good as it should be, implying that more research is necessary to explore possible combinations of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.\n\n""This study shows that, for women who need or choose to avoid medications, electro-acupuncture may be an option because it has minimal risks, but blinded controlled trials are needed,"" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, NAMS executive director.\n\n###\n\nFunding for the study was provided in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Cancer Center.']","The release is absent of useful details savvy readers look for when analyzing an intervention such as demonstrated benefit, cost, harms, and sponsors.","This short release reports on a small study looking at whether electro-acupuncture is effective in diminishing night-time hot flashes among breast cancer survivors, and therefore, improving the quality of their sleep.  While it states that this therapeutic approach is as good as, or perhaps better, than a drug (gabapentin) often prescribed for hot flashes, the release offers no data showing the extent of improvement, nor are there mentions of the cost of such treatments, or of potential harms from using it which, while not enormous, are not negligible either.  The release also neglects to identify any of the researchers involved in the trial.

1957,story_reviews_00823,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/dna-markers-may-predict-impotence-after-prostate-cancer/,2012-09-27 04:00:00,DNA markers may predict impotence after prostate cancer,"['For men diagnosed with prostate cancer, the decision about how to treat it -- or even whether to treat it -- can be agonizing. Surgery, radiation, or some combination of both may lead to miserable side effects such incontinence, impotence and rectal damage. Doctors usually can’t predict whether a man will suffer all or none of those side effects. While some risk factors are well-known -- including age, diabetes and poor cardiovascular health -- whether a man suffers harsh side-effects is often chalked up to random luck.\n\nSo what if it were possible to know before treatment which men might be more likely to suffer complications?\n\nNew research, published Thursday in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, discovered a set of genetic markers that appear to indicate a significantly greater risk of collateral damage from radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Knowing a man’s susceptibility to fallout from radiation may steer a doctor toward surgery instead of other potentially damaging therapy.\n\n“More often than not, it’s not clear-cut which way to go,” explained Barry Rosenstein, professor of radiation oncology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. “If you see a surgeon, he’s likely to say surgery is best. If you see a radiation oncologist he’ll say oncology.”\n\nDetermining what type of treatment a man should receive is only part of the dilemma of prostate cancer. The debate whether to even test for it is ongoing. This early-stage study represents a big step toward doctors and their patients making that decision.\n\nThe researchers started with a pool of 841 men treated with radiation for prostate cancer. Patients were assessed every three to six months for signs of sexual dysfunction for up to five years. The number of men studied was eventually winnowed down to 260 patients with erectile dysfunction and 205 controls.\n\nThe scientists then performed DNA analyses on the men, looking for genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced snips), slight differences in the “spelling” of our DNA. After sifting through hundreds of thousands of SNPs, they settled on 12 suspect genetic variations.\n\nIt turned out that when the SNPs were combined to create a score that could be used to measure individual risk of treatment complications, having just one of the 12 SNPs more than doubled the risk. The more of the 12 a man had, the greater his chances of radiation therapy complications.\n\n“It is cumulative,” Rosenstein explained. “If a man has five or six, it increases his chances quite a bit.”\n\nThe research is still in the early stages, so doctors aren’t likely to be using the genetic markers to determine treatment any time soon. “This is still not nearly good enough, yet” he said.\n\nBut he’s part of an international consortium that is trying to make that very scenario a practical reality. The next step, he said, is for group members to validate the predictive power of the markers his team found.\n\nIf they can, then doctors really will be “able to assign patients to treatments and see if we maintain the same level of control of cancer and lower the incidence of complications,” he said. “And if we can do that, then there’ll be enough confidence to put it into use in the clinic.”\n\nEven better, he suggested, it may one day be possible to use drugs to target the SNiPs, or the biological processes they influence, as a way to prevent damage from therapy.\n\nThat hope is evident to other researchers, such as Dr. Ithaar Derweesh, a urologic oncologist and associate professor of surgery at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center.\n\n""This is a study that in certain ways is groundbreaking and also elegantly performed,"" Derweesh said.\n\nWhile Derweesh agreed with Rosenstein that such a technique will take time to validate, and be used to steer patients toward a particular therapy -- something he called the ""holy grail"" -- he suggested that in the nearer term, such markers might be used as a trigger to pre-emptively begin erectile rehabilitation or to take measures that might lessen the potential damage.\n\nThis kind of work is important not just for prostate cancer, but all cancers. While there has been greater success in treating cancer, survivors may live many years with side effects after treatment. If Rosenstein’s hopes are fulfilled, it may one day be possible to prevent some of the damage before it’s done, and still effectively treat the cancer.\n\nBrian Alexander (www.BrianRAlexander.com) is co-author, with Larry Young Ph.D., of ""The Chemistry Between Us: Love, Sex and the Science of Attraction,"" (www.TheChemistryBetweenUs.com), now on sale.\n\nRelated:']","This story, based on a paper in a radiation oncology journal, never tells readers whether the radiation treatment that followed the test in question helped the men in the study in terms of cancer control.  Big picture missing.","The story reports on interesting and important research, but the story gets satisfactory scores on less than half of our criteria.

Proof that they help is not.,"['And that duck on a plane? It might be an emotional-support animal prescribed by a mental health professional.\n\nThe trend, which has accelerated hugely since its initial stirrings a few decades ago, is underpinned by a widespread belief that interaction with animals can reduce distress — whether it happens over brief caresses at the airport or in long-term relationships at home. Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. But the popular embrace of pets as furry therapists is causing growing discomfort among some researchers in the field, who say it has raced far ahead of scientific evidence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year in the Journal of Applied Developmental Science, an introduction to a series of articles on “animal-assisted intervention” said research into its efficacy “remains in its infancy.” A recent literature review by Molly Crossman, a Yale University doctoral candidate who recently wrapped up one study involving an 8-year-old dog named Pardner, cited a “murky body of evidence” that sometimes has shown positive short-term effects, often found no effect and occasionally identified higher rates of distress.\n\nOverall, Crossman wrote, animals seem to be helpful in a “small-to-medium” way, but it’s unclear whether the critters deserve the credit or something else is at play.\n\n“It’s a field that has been sort of carried forward by the convictions of practitioners” who have seen patients’ mental health improve after working with or adopting animals, said James Serpell, director of the Center for the Interaction of Animals and Society at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “That kind of thing has almost driven the field, and the research is playing catch-up. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn’t enough.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUsing animals in mental health settings is nothing new. In the 17th century, a Quaker-run retreat in England encouraged mentally ill patients to interact with animals on its grounds. Sigmund Freud often included one of his dogs in psychoanalysis sessions. Yet the subject did not become a research target until the American child psychologist Boris Levinson began writing in the 1960s about the positive effect his dog Jingles had on patients.\n\nBut the evidence to date is problematic, according to Crossman’s review and others before it. Most studies had small sample sizes, she wrote, and an “alarming number” did not control for other possible reasons for a changed stress level, such as interaction with the animal’s human handler. Studies also tend to generalize across animals, she noted: If participants are measurably soothed by one golden retriever, that doesn’t mean another dog — or another species — will evoke the same response.\n\nEven so, media headlines are often about the happiness bounce. Hal Herzog, a Western Carolina University psychologist who has long studied human-animal interactions, recalls a 2015 study on the health benefits for children of having a pet dog. “Here’s a reason to get a puppy,” NBC announced. “Kids with pets have less anxiety.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat’s actually not what the study concluded. The authors did find that children with dogs had lower anxiety based on screening scores than children without dogs. Still, they cautioned that “this study does not answer whether pet dogs have direct effects on children’s mental health or whether other factors associated with acquisition of a pet dog benefit their mental health.”\n\nIt was a classic case of conflating correlation and causation, which Herzog says is common. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). The pet-industry backed organization funds research on the topic.\n\n“The number of papers I see that start out, ‘It is now well-established that there are health benefits from owning pets’ — that drives me crazy,” Herzog said. “Yes, there’s literature that supports that. But there’s also literature that doesn’t find that.”\n\nHABRI Executive Director Steven Feldman takes a more positive view of the science while acknowledging that more research needs to be done. “Just like getting vegetables and getting exercise, I would say having animals in our lives is also an essential element of human wellness,” he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo many animal lovers and pet owners, the back-and-forth might sound horribly wonky. There’s something intuitive about the good feelings animals give us. Why over-analyze it?\n\nAlan Beck does not disagree. Beck, who directs the Center of the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, cites one common theory for why animals might be therapeutic. It’s called the biophilia hypothesis, and it argues that humans evolved a built-in need to affiliate with other living beings.\n\n“Throughout history, animals gave us some comfort. So if it works for you and me in a relatively normal environment, maybe it has a special role for someone who has a depression and stress disorder — that just makes sense,” he said. “The literature does show it’s not bad. And that’s just as important.”\n\nFocusing too much on scientific support sometimes feels like a form of “physics envy,” Beck added, “where you try to quantify everything without appreciating it.”\n\nBut there are good reasons for rigorous research on animals and mental health. In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it would not cover costs of service dogs for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, citing “a lack of evidence to support a finding of mental health service dog efficacy.” The department is now in the midst of a multiyear study on the topic, which could lead to government funding for these pooches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnother reason, the scientists say, is for the animals’ sake. Crossman pointed to a 2014 incident at Washington University in St. Louis as an example of animal therapy gone wrong. A bear cub brought to campus during finals week nipped some students, causing a rabies scare that almost ended with the animal being euthanized. More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier “is not a harmless distortion. … If the public believes that getting an animal is going to be good for them, many times an unsuitable person will get an unsuitable animal, and it doesn’t work out well for either.”\n\nThe research is getting stronger, in part because funding is growing — from HABRI as well as from a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health and the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition. Crossman’s recent study at the Yale Innovative Interactions Lab was among the work being supported.\n\nIt relied not just on the Labrador retriever Pardner but seven other certified therapy dogs. Several times a month over much of the past year, they hung out at the university for 15-minute sessions with children who had just finished two stressful tasks: spontaneously crafting stories and telling them to strangers, followed by doing math problems.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe strangers were the researchers, and their mission was to assess whether the kids, ages 10 to 13, would find their time with the dogs to be therapeutic. The study was designed to avoid some of the pitfalls that Crossman has seen elsewhere, which is why some of the 78 young participants got to play only with a fuzzy blanket — because tactile stimulation is known to reduce stress — and why others simply waited for the 15 minutes.\n\n“Without the controls, the changes could be due to all kinds of things, like the fact that lots of time has passed,” Crossman said. “Kids are actually pretty good at coping.”\n\nThe children completed questionnaires to assess their mood and anxiety before and after; spit samples, to measure the “stress hormone” cortisol, were taken at three points. At the end, all the kids got a “junior scientist” certificate, lots of praise and an open play session with the dogs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCrossman, who emphasizes that she is an animal lover, declined to reveal the findings before they’re published. But “hopefully” they will show that dogs can affect children’s stress, she said — before quickly offering a researcher’s clarification.\n\n“I say ‘hopefully’ not just because I think it works or hope it does, but because these programs are used so widely,” she explained. “Kids are already participating in this on a huge scale. Ideally, the order goes the other way around: We test the idea, and then we implement.”\n\nRead more:\n\nAD']",The story effectively conveys the lack of scientific consensus regarding how effective therapy animals are at reducing stress.,"The story focuses on the lack of evidence supporting the fundamental concept of “therapy animals” — that interacting with animals can reduce stress or distress in humans.
The story includes input from an array of expert sources and offers a broad (if vague) overview of the research literature regarding therapy animals. There are some shortcomings here — for example, not much was said about the costs of pet therapy.
However, in sum, the story effectively conveys the lack of scientific consensus regarding how effective therapy animals are at reducing stress.

Although the tumors were small, these cancers can spread to lymph nodes under the arm, which can allow the tumors to spread around the body through the lymph system.\n\nAs a precaution, doctors usually remove some of these lymph nodes. But that surgery can be painful and lead to an incurable and sometimes disabling condition called lymphedema, which causes the arm to swell.\n\nIn recent years, doctors have made an effort to spare women from this complication by first removing only one or two crucial lymph nodes, called the sentinel nodes. If those nodes contain cancer, doctors remove many of the other lymph nodes. If the sentinel nodes are cancer-free, doctors leave the others in place, greatly reducing the risk of lymphedema.\n\nIn this study, doctors found that it\'s not necessary to take out additional lymph nodes, even if they find cancer in the sentinel ones. About 92% of women were alive after five years, whether or not the extra lymph nodes were removed, according to the study, conducted at 115 locations around the USA and funded by the National Cancer Institute.\n\nResults of the study were presented at a medical meeting last summer, and some surgeons are already changing their practices. The University of Washington-Seattle Cancer Care Alliance began removing fewer lymph nodes at the end of last year, ""after a faculty retreat and lots of discussion,"" professor Julie Gralow says.\n\nThe findings apply to only a small number of breast cancer patients. On average, the women in the study were in their 50s, and women who had mastectomies weren\'t included, Gralow says.\n\nAlso, women in the study had small tumors, with only one or two affected lymph nodes, says Mehra Golshan, of Boston\'s Dana Farber/Brigham and Women\'s Cancer Center. The findings may not apply to women with three or four affected lymph nodes or larger tumors. And doctors don\'t yet know how the women will fare in the long term, because researchers followed them for only six years, he says.\n\nThe American Cancer Society\'s Otis Brawley doesn\'t think doctors will change their methods overnight.\n\nEven so, depending on the results of other ongoing research, this study may influence medical practice over the next three to five years, he says.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Good job in a short story, but for more depth and decision-making help, women would get more out of the 3,500-word </span>","Improved quality of life, with no reduction in survival.

But the standard PSA test cannot distinguish between cancers that grow so slowly they can safely be left alone and aggressive life-threatening tumors that call for surgery or radiation therapy.\n\nThe new test measures blood levels of three different types of PSA. Combined with annual biopsies, or tissue samples, it was about 70 percent accurate in singling out the aggressive tumors in a small study, John Hopkins University researchers were to report Sunday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, in Washington, D.C.\n\n""What we have shown is that using the Prostate Health Index and tissue DNA measurement is informative in separating out patients whose cancers are likely to progress vs. those that are not likely to progress,"" said study leader Robert W. Veltri, an associate professor of urology and oncology at Hopkins.\n\nProstate Health Index is the name given to the test by Beckman Coulter Inc., which plans to market it.\n\nThe study included 71 men originally diagnosed as having small, low-grade and low-stage prostate cancer, the kind whose ultimate aggressiveness is often in doubt.\n\nCurrently, identifying the dangerous tumors in that group is no better than ""a coin-flip,"" Veltri said, and, as a result, many men and their doctors choose treatment that might be unnecessary and can cause impotence and other major problems.\n\nMen in the trial had periodic blood tests that measured three different forms of PSA, including pro-PSA, a molecule in which two of the amino acids that make up the protein have been clipped off. It is the pro-PSA level that is most valuable as a predictor, Veltri said, but it is only one part of the study.\n\nThe new PSA test is given twice a year, along with a digital rectal exam to determine the size of the tumor, and a yearly biopsy. The regimen found unfavorable indications for 39 of the cancers -- meaning progression of cancer grade or tumor size -- and favorable for the 32 others, Veltri said. ""When you combine the DNA reading and the serum Prostate Health Index, it is accurate in about 7 out of 10 cases,"" he said.\n\nBut it was a small study, and ""it will take another year or two to get enough cases to nail down the predictive index,"" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins group is trying to identify other biomarkers that would improve the program\'s predictive value, he said. One hope is that the now-annual biopsies could be done every other year, Veltri said.\n\nThe study results have caused ""excitement,"" he said. ""Through active surveillance, we can identify a set of prostate cancer patients with low-grade tumors that may be able to have intervention deferred or delayed,"" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins work was described as ""outstanding"" by Dr. William J. Catalona, director of the prostate cancer program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital\'s Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, who pioneered the use of the standard PSA test and helped develop the new version of the test.\n\nThe test is awaiting approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and already is approved for use in Europe, Catalona said. In a study of 2,000 men in the Chicago area, ""we found it to be more accurate than the tests now available, and it also seems to identify the more aggressive prostate cancers,"" he said.\n\nAnother report at the same meeting described use of a microchip to detect tumor cells in the blood of people with prostate cancer. The presence of circulating cells can indicate spread of the cancer to other parts of the body, but they are so rare that they are invisible to current technology.\n\nThe new circulating tumor cell (CTC) chip identified such cells in nearly half of 20 people with early-stage prostate cancer and in two-thirds of people with advanced cancer, providing important prognostic information, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital reported.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn about diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer from the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']",The language of the story was more persuasive about the success of the tests reported on than the current data suggest. ,"The bottom line is that the value of the new test remains quite uncertain.  The study’s sample size was small, the follow-up period appeared relatively short, and the accuracy statistics were difficult to interpret.   The story reports on a study in 71 men, but allows another source to throw in unsourced information about a Chicago-area study in 2,000 men.

Australian revised National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for obesity management say that lap band surgery should be considered in adolescents with severe obesity – that is with a body mass index (BMI) over 40 kg/m2 or over 35 kg/m2 (weight/height2) with the presence of obesity-related diseases and who don’t respond to medical treatment. However there is no data available in Australian adolescents beyond 24 months post-surgery.\n\n“We are talking about a group of adolescents with severe obesity and significant health and psychological problems related to their increased weight – this is not for everyone,” says corresponding author and Paediatric Endocrinologist Dr Alexia Peña, who is a Senior Lecturer with the University of Adelaide’s Robinson Research Institute.\n\nThe study found that weight and BMI improved significantly at all follow-up times following surgery from three months through to 45 months and, in some cases, as long as five years. BMI loss was between 7.1 and 14.7 kg/m2.\n\n“The median BMI reduction of 10 kg/m2 with the lap band is a good result when compared to BMI reduction using the few medications available or lifestyle measures, which is around 1-3 kg/m2,” says Dr Peña. “Lap band surgery is reversible and allows time for adolescents to mature to make a more informed decision on a permanent surgical procedure if required later on in life. This is not the case for other surgeries currently offered for obesity management.\n\n“It is also important that teenagers undergoing this surgery have access to an experienced surgeon as part of a multidisciplinary paediatric team of doctors and Health professionals to ensure there is long-term regular follow-up.”\n\nPaediatric surgeon Mr Sanjeev Khurana, who did all the lap band surgeries between 2009 and 2013, says lap band surgery is a reversible surgical procedure that can be safely used in teens with severe obesity.\n\n“Although gastric banding has been controversial and is currently less used in adults with severe obesity, lap band surgery is one of the most studied surgeries for obesity management, has a high safety record and can be a temporary option to manage severe obesity during adolescence,” says Mr Khurana, who is also a Senior Lecturer in the University of Adelaide’s Discipline of Paediatrics.\n\n“Our findings support lap band surgery as a safe and effective option for management of adolescents with severe obesity – provided it is performed by an experienced surgeon and managed afterwards in a paediatric multidisciplinary environment with regular follow-up until adulthood.”\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nDr Alexia Peña, Paediatric Endocrinologist and Senior Lecturer, Robinson Research Institute, University of Adelaide.

The release states that two-thirds of the teens lost significant amounts of weight for up to five years and further describes the procedure as “a first option” to manage obesity during adolescence.
Researchers quoted in the text repeatedly and appropriately cautioned that the procedure “is not for everyone” and requires careful management, but the release remained determinedly cheery about the outcome. Importantly, it also failed to acknowledge the small sample size in this study and the lack of a control group,  as well as the health complications that stymied a few of the participants. Also ignored was that one-third of the 21 participants either failed to lose weight or began to regain it over the course of the study. Lap band surgery for severely obese teens is clearly no panacea.

They\'re rich in fiber, folic acid, and potassium. Walnuts are especially heart healthy because they have more polyunsaturated fat than almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans, pistachios, and macadamia nuts per serving. Walnut oil can be a good alternative too, in dressings and for light basting, Politi said.\n\nIt\'s still important to remember portion control, especially for people on weight loss programs, warned Politi.\n\n""Try a serving in a snack bag.

But within 40 minutes of receiving a ketamine injection, their depressive symptoms improved; the effect persisted for at least three days.\n\nRight now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study.\n\nAnd as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide. “We want to alleviate the suffering and get them back to their life,” he said.\n\nZarate and his colleagues had previously demonstrated that ketamine shots helped some patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression, meaning they did not cycle through manic episodes. In the new study, they gave patients with bipolar illness ketamine or a placebo on two test days two weeks apart.\n\nAll of the patients were on lithium or valproate - two drugs commonly used for bipolar illness - but had not responded to treatment. Nearly all were unemployed, Zarate and his team note, and two-thirds were on psychiatric disability.\n\nCompared to placebo, patients showed significant improvement in mood within 40 minutes of receiving the ketamine infusion, using a common depression rating scale. Symptom improvement peaked two days after the injection, but remained significantly greater than for placebo for three days.\n\nSeventy-one percent of the patients responded to ketamine, meaning they had at least a 50 percent improvement in their depressive symptoms. Six percent responded to placebo.\n\nSide effects included anxiety, “feeling woozy or loopy,” headache, and dissociative symptoms, meaning a temporary sense of disconnection from reality, although there were no serious adverse events. By developing more specifically targeted drugs, Zarate noted, it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms.\n\nKetamine appears to work by “resetting” the way nerve cells process glutamate, a brain chemical key for learning, memory, and other functions, according to Zarate. The problem in bipolar illness and depression, he explains, doesn’t appear to be that a person has too much or too little glutamate; instead, it’s likely that the way their neurons release and take up the chemical is out of whack.\n\nFirst introduced in 1962, ketamine is used legally in both human and veterinary medicine as an anesthetic. It’s also a drug of abuse, at much higher doses than those used in Zarate’s research; while patients in the current study received about 50 milligrams during a 40-minute period, a dose too low to induce anesthesia, recreational users of ketamine, known as “Special K,” may take hundreds of milligrams per week.\n\nIn 1999, US regulators classified ketamine as a Schedule III controlled substance, meaning it has the potential for abuse but is also useful medically.\n\nKetamine could improve treatment of bipolar illness and depression in a variety of ways, Zarate said; for example, as a means to jump-start standard drug treatment, or as an anesthetic before ECT. “It’s opened the floodgate of many different directions of research, and all of them are quite encouraging,” said Zarate, who along with a co-author has filed for a patent on the use of ketamine in depression. Those rights would be assigned to his employer, the National Institutes of Health.\n\nEfforts are already underway in Europe to develop guidelines for how ketamine should be used and prescribed to treat bipolar illness and depression, the researcher said.\n\nIn the US, research is continuing on the drug, he added, and some physicians are likely trying the drug in their patients with bipolar illness or depression who aren’t helped by standard treatments. But, according to Zarate, more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most effective way.\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/wek23n Archives of General Psychiatry, August 2010.']","Granted, this was a story about a difficult-to-treat condition.  But there just weren’t enough caveats about the limitatons of an 18-person study.  The very last line needed to be far higher in the story: ""more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most  effective way.""  ","Instead, the headline leaps with optimism about lifting mood quickly. The story quoted no outside sources, gave no cost information, no uncritical evaluation of the evidence, offered limited comparison with alternative therapies, and limited discussion of the potentially harmful effects of putting a sizeable percentage of the population struggling with depression onto a highly addictive narcotic.

The study also noted that the device provides a helpful guide for post-treatment mammograms and other long-term follow-up to check for any cancer recurrence in these patients.\n\nA second study, presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2016 annual conference, describes the extra utility that BioZorb can provide, by significantly reducing the amount of normal breast and surrounding tissues that are exposed to radiation treatment.\n\nThe World Journal of Surgery article, by lead author breast surgeon Michael J. Cross, concluded that the 3-D marker is an ""effective method for delineating the tumor bed with a significant utility for RT (radiation therapy) planning.""\n\nIn the course of this three-year study, Dr. Cross and colleagues also documented a favorable shift toward use of hypo-fractionated radiation treatment, a shorter form of radiation associated with a substantial reduction in treatment costs.\n\n""Through our experience with this marker, we\'ve observed that its use results in less radiation dose to the patient compared to whole breast radiation, plus a better overall cosmetic outcome,"" said Dr. Cross, a nationally known breast surgeon at Breast Treatment Associates, in Fayetteville Ark. ""We were also pleased to note in our research that there were no device-related complications in this group of patients, and that none of them had a recurrence of cancer.""\n\nThe BioZorb device is placed during lumpectomy surgery, which removes the cancer and preserves the breast. It is the first and only device that identifies in a reliable way the 3-D region where the tumor was removed. It is particularly effective because by suturing the implant to the tumor bed, the surgeon can more precisely indicate to the radiation oncologist where the cancer was located. Dr. Cross notes that because of the marker\'s unique configuration, it can also assist with reconstructing the surgical region during the healing process.\n\nThe implantable marker consists of a framework made of a bioabsorbable material that holds six titanium clips. The framework slowly dissolves in the body over the course of a year or more. The tiny marker clips stay in place so the surgical site can be viewed for long-term monitoring such as mammograms.\n\nAs part of the research for the World Journal of Surgery study, 108 patients with early-stage breast cancer were prospectively implanted with the marker during ""reconstructive lumpectomy,"" a method of oncoplastic surgery to remove the cancer while reconstructing the remaining breast to improve cosmetic outcomes. The average age of women in the study was 63 years.\n\nThe authors concluded that the marker was helpful for several different types of physicians involved in the care of women with breast cancer: surgeons, radiation oncologists who plan and oversee radiation treatment, and radiologists who follow women after breast cancer treatment.\n\nThe article also noted that there was a shift during the three-year course of the study toward increasing use of hypo-fractionated radiation methods. These methods decrease the time it takes for patients to complete radiation treatment -- and are estimated to cut the cost of treatment by approximately 25%. The authors said use of the marker facilitated their shift toward these shorter courses of radiotherapy.\n\nUse of the marker allowed physicians to be more confident in their targeting and rely less on ""ambiguous planning targets such as the seroma and surrounding tissue changes."" Seroma is a collection of fluid that builds up in the area of tissue injury after surgery.\n\nWhile seromas have customarily been targeted for radiation treatment, they do not always reflect where the cancer was and can overestimate the size of the target areas in need of radiation. By more precisely marking the tumor bed, the article said, BioZorb can reduce the amount of healthy tissue that would otherwise receive unnecessary radiation.\n\nThe second recent study, presented at the 2016 annual ASTRO conference in Boston, described a collaborative approach between a radiation oncologist and breast surgeon. They studied the question of whether the marker could better identify the true lumpectomy cavity and thereby reduce the amount of tissue that is irradiated.\n\nThe authors – radiation oncologist William Hall, M.D., and breast surgeon Cary Kaufman, M.D. -- combined their analysis of 10 cases in which BioZorb was used.\n\nThey concluded that the tissue marker could significantly reduce radiation of healthy breast tissue (an average of 65% reduction), as well as avoid irradiating inadvertent seromas that are more common with oncoplastic procedures. By providing better targeting, they said, the marker could also play a role in facilitating the use of external beam partial breast irradiation.\n\n""The process of delivering radiation treatment is substantially streamlined by having the 3D marker in place,"" said Dr. Hall. ""The marker tells us where the tumor was and helps us determine appropriate forms of treatment, whether with partial breast irradiation or standard whole breast irradiation and a boost dose at the end of the treatment process.""\n\nDr. Hall is a radiation oncologist in the Department of Radiation Oncology at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center (Bellingham, Wash). Dr. Kaufman is Medical Director of the Bellingham Regional Breast Center and past chairman of the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers.\n\nResources\n\nInfographic on BioZorb\n\nHow the marker works\n\nAbout Focal Therapeutics\n\nFocal Therapeutics is a medical device company based in Aliso Viejo, Calif. The company\'s BioZorb marker is a proprietary bioabsorbable device that provides radiographic marking of soft tissue sites.

He then lifted the small intestine out of the body to sift it through his fingers.\n\nAs he found tumors, he snipped them out. “You can see how this is coming off like wallpaper,” Dr. Lowy said as he stripped out part of the lining of the man’s abdominal cavity.\n\nAfter about two hours of poking and cutting, Dr. Lowy began the so-called shake and bake. The machine pumped heated chemotherapy directly into the abdominal cavity for 90 minutes while nurses gently jiggled the man’s bloated belly to disperse the drug to every nook and cranny.\n\nThe treatment is formally called cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, or Hipec.\n\nRecent converts include University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx , and even Massachusetts General. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center is looking at it, according to people in the field. Advocates predict that the number of procedures could grow to 10,000 a year from about 1,500 now.\n\nThe therapy has even been featured on an episode of the TV series “Grey’s Anatomy.”\n\nBut Dr. Ryan, a gastrointestinal oncologist, suggested in an interview that the procedure was being extended to colorectal cancer because “you can’t make a living doing this procedure in appendix cancer patients.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe debated the procedure publicly at the recent annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. While some patients did seem to live much longer than expected, he said that they had been carefully selected and might have fared well even without the therapy.\n\nProponents say that if cancer has spread into the abdominal cavity but not elsewhere, then lives can be prolonged by removing all the visible tumor and killing what’s missed with Hipec.\n\nBy contrast, said Dr. Paul Sugarbaker, a surgeon at Washington Hospital Center and the leading proponent of Hipec, “there are no long-term survivors with systemic chemotherapy — zero.”\n\nDr. Sugarbaker, who opposed Dr. Ryan in the debate, said that it has long been known that cancerous cells are unable to withstand as much heat as healthy cells. And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream.\n\nOne randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the Netherlands did show a striking benefit. The median survival of those getting surgery and Hipec, plus intravenous chemotherapy, was 22.3 months, almost double the 12.6 months for those getting only the intravenous chemotherapy. But 8 percent who got the surgery and Hipec died from the treatment itself. And critics say that since that trial was conducted, new drugs have come to market that allow patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to live two years with intravenous chemotherapy alone.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After nearly a year only one patient had enrolled, because people were reluctant to chance winding up in the control group, according to one of the investigators.\n\nWhile proponents contend that the risk of dying from the surgery has been reduced since the Dutch trial, the procedure still lasts eight hours or more and full recovery can take three to six months. “It’s maximally invasive,” said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the “spare parts” — organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus.\n\nThe cost of the surgery and Hipec, including hospitalization, ranges from $20,000 to more than $100,000, doctors said. While Medicare and insurers generally pay for the operation, the heated treatment may not be covered. But doctors added it may be if it is described merely as chemotherapy. Some patients, like Ms. Borges, who is a fitness devotee, recover well and say the procedure staved off a death sentence.\n\nBut Dr. Alan Venook, a colon cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco , said that a couple of patients referred by him had “died miserable deaths. One lost much of her abdominal wall to infection and just died in misery.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother risk is that the surgery may be done unnecessarily. CT scans cannot pick up many of the small tumors, so it is often unclear how much cancer is inside until the patient is opened.\n\nIn June, Dr. Lowy sliced open a woman and saw, to his horror, that she had more tumors than he could remove. Taking out only some would not improve her chances of survival, so he closed the incision, and she is now starting intravenous chemotherapy.\n\nThings with the male patient, Andy S., went better. A 41-year-old father of two from near San Francisco , Mr. S. agreed to let a reporter observe the surgery, but asked that his full name not be published because he did not want his cancer history to surface through Web searches.\n\nMr. S. had abdominal pain eventually diagnosed as appendicitis . But the appendix was found to be cancerous. Such cancers typically spew mucus containing tumor cells into the abdominal cavity. So he signed up for surgery and Hipec with Dr. Lowy.\n\n“I’ve had to say my goodbyes to everybody,” Mr. S. said the day before the operation. “I had to talk to my priest. I had to do all these things I never thought I’d have to do at 41. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy, but I have to go through with it.”\n\nDr. Lowy explored the entire cavity from the diaphragm to the pelvis. He found mucus in several spots that he sopped up with a cloth and also tiny tumors the size of a pencil eraser that had implanted in several spots. He snipped those out and sewed up the wounds. He removed the right side of the man’s colon and the omentum, a fatty structure.\n\nThen two Y-shaped tubes hooked to the Hipec machine were inserted into the abdominal cavity, one to deliver the chemotherapy and the other to bring the drug back to the machine to be reheated. The incision was sewn up around the tubes so the chemotherapy would not leak.\n\nThe man’s belly was filled with three liters of saline fluid and the chemotherapy, a generic drug called mitomycin C, heated to 42 degrees Celsius, or nearly 108 degrees Fahrenheit. Any hotter could have caused injuries. Bloated with liquid, the man’s torso resembled a water bed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter 90 minutes, the fluid was drained and the incision reopened for a final check before the patient was stitched up. The procedure took six hours.\n\n“We got all of the visible disease, and he didn’t have a lot of visible disease,” Dr. Lowy said with satisfaction.\n\nMr. S. left the hospital eight days later, happy to have undergone the treatment. “I want to have the best chance I can have to never see this again,” he said.""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story provides an excellent look at the controversies related to a new form of treatment and the role of manufacturers in pushing its acceptance.<br/>

Only about 300 Americans are diagnosed with this cancer each year. The tumors can be complex to treat because they are located along the spinal cord, nerves and arteries. Chordomas are part of a group of tumors called sarcomas. While slow growing, they can be aggressive.\n\nLife-threatening tumor\n\nBlindsided by the news his tailbone pain was caused by a life-threatening tumor, Tracy sought information and opinions. His doctor referred him to specialists at a major medical center in San Francisco. He learned surgery is the most common treatment. But, a surgeon told Tracy and wife, Karin Rittenberg, he should prepare for possible complications.\n\nSaid Tracy, ""We were told that I should prepare myself for the loss of functionality below the waist – including bowel, bladder and sexual functions. Even with surgery, there was a high risk of recurrence. That\'s when we began to research other options, such as radiation therapy.""\n\nTreatment options\n\nThe couple then met with a radiation oncologist. The doctor explained in cases where surgery is not an option or the outcome of surgery was unacceptable, people turn to definitive radiation therapy. He provided Tracy and Karin with a copy of a published research paper on chordoma and the effects of definitive radiation. The lead author and researcher was Dr. Peyman Kabolizadeh, clinical director, Beaumont Proton Therapy Center in Royal Oak. While the findings were written for health care professionals and very technical, Tracy was encouraged.\n\n""Definitive radiation therapy refers to curative radiation,"" explained Dr. Kabolizadeh. ""Radiation is the only treatment the patient receives."" In his study published in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics, he and his colleagues found, ""in circumstances where surgery may result in significant neurologic or organ dysfunction, patients can be treated definitively with radiation therapy alone. The results supported the use of high-dose definitive radiation therapy, via proton beam therapy, for selected patients with unresected spine and sacral chordomas.""\n\nThe San Francisco radiation oncologist not only shared Dr. Kabolizadeh\'s research paper, but also his contact information. Both Tracy and Karin learned about the differences between photon and proton radiation. They did their homework on treatment options, but for Tracy it became quite frustrating. Karin persisted in her fact-finding, when Tracy was down emotionally.\n\n""You have to understand, because this cancer is so rare, there is limited research available,"" Tracy said. ""That was the truly scary part about making any decisions.""\n\nSecond, third and more opinions\n\nThey conferred with Dr. Kabolizadeh at Beaumont in Michigan by telephone. The couple also traveled to a highly-regarded cancer center in New York City.\n\n""It seemed everyone I spoke with had a different opinion,"" said Tracy. ""I then determined, definitive radiation therapy was the way to go, but I had to decide which type and where. There was photon therapy available in San Francisco, but, in my research, I found out the photon beams don\'t stop at the tumor and have a greater possibility of affecting surrounding organs, too. I liked what I heard about the advantages of proton beams precisely targeting the tumor and stopping, sparing nearby tissue from harmful radiation.""\n\nDeciding on proton therapy\n\nSeveral factors went into Tracy\'s decision to choose proton therapy at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. Not only were he and Karin impressed with the advanced cancer killing capabilities of the pencil beam proton therapy, but also with the expertise of Dr. Kabolizadeh.\n\n""I looked at survivability, length of life and quality of life. Right now, I\'m living life to the fullest and have a beautiful wife. We travel, entertain friends and are diehard Giants fans,"" explained Tracy. ""Beaumont has the most advanced equipment, and someone who is familiar with treatments for my rare cancer. I felt that gave me the best chance of success. Dr. Kabolizadeh has the vehicle and knows how to drive it! Every time we spoke, he was honest, open and candid. His candor was refreshing.""\n\nAbout 3 months after his cancer diagnosis, Tracy traveled to Royal Oak in late January to begin his proton treatments. On Tuesday, April 3, he completed his nine weeks of treatment.\n\nHe not only looks forward to watching his beloved Giants at AT&T Park, but hanging out with his dog Neyo. And Karin looks forward to him shaving the ""treatment beard"" he has been growing since his treatments began.\n\nBeaumont proton team \'second to none\'\n\n""I realize I\'m extremely fortunate to have been able to consider traveling to another state for treatment and live there for two and a half months,"" said Tracy. ""I\'m also fortunate that Karin\'s company has been supportive of her working remotely so she could stay with me. And I\'m so grateful for the tremendous outpouring of love and support we\'ve received from our family and friends during our stay in Michigan. That helped keep our spirits high.""\n\nAnd when asked about his treatment experience, Tracy remarked, ""Every single person that I\'ve engaged with at Beaumont has been a delight. They all made what could have been a difficult experience tolerable. The facilities are impressive, clean and welcoming, but the difference is the people – best hospital staff I\'ve ever encountered. The team in the Proton Therapy Center is second to none.""\n\nAbout Beaumont\'s Proton Therapy Center\n\nBeaumont\'s center is one of just 28 proton therapy centers in the U.S. It is the only operational proton therapy center in Michigan.\n\nHow proton therapy works\n\nProton therapy is a high-tech alternative to X-ray radiation. A scanning beam of proton radiation with online image guidance offers greater precision to destroy cancerous cells, sparing adjacent healthy tissue with fewer side effects.\n\nProton therapy uses positively charged atomic particles, traveling up to two-thirds the speed of light, to fight cancer. A cyclotron, or particle accelerator, creates protons from hydrogen molecules. The proton beam is sent to the treatment room through a transport system consisting of magnets, called the beam line, finally arriving in the gantry, a device that rotates around the patient. The beam is directed to the patient through a nozzle that targets the tumor.\n\nWhile proton therapy is not effective against all cancers, it is effective in treating many solid and localized tumors.\n\nAdvanced technology\n\n""Our IBA ProteusOne single-room treatment system includes precision technologies,"" said Dr. Kabolizadeh. ""Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy, which combines Pencil Beam Scanning and 3-D Cone Beam CT, can target a tumor within less than a millimeter.""\n\nPencil Beam Scanning refers to the delivery of protons in a thin beam. Like a pencil, the beam uses back and forth motions to target the treatment area – the shape, size and depth. It ""paints"" a radiation dose on tumors layer by layer. Compared to X-ray beams, which pass through a patient, proton beams deliver targeted radiation to the tumor and then stop – resulting in no exit dose.\n\nRadiation oncologists at Beaumont are well versed in precise image guidance, having developed cone beam CT technology almost 20 years ago.\n\nDr. Kabolizadeh explained, ""Image guidance allows doctors to visualize tumors during therapy to assess response and make sure the tumor is treated correctly every day.""\n\nComprehensive cancer care\n\nProton therapy is an important addition to Beaumont\'s comprehensive arsenal of leading-edge cancer treatments. Beaumont\'s Radiation Oncology department is ranked among the nation\'s best for advanced technology, innovative treatment and research. Advanced radiation treatments developed at Beaumont include adaptive radiation therapy, image-guided radiation therapy, intensity-modulated arc therapy, high-dose rate brachytherapy and hyperthermia therapy.\n\nTo learn more about the new center and its capabilities, call Beaumont\'s Radiation Oncology program at 248-551-8402 or go to www.Beaumont.org/proton-therapy.\n\nMedia contacts:\n\nRobert.Ortlieb@beaumont.org, 248-551-1077\n\nMark.Geary@beaumont.org, 248-551-0743\n\nSOURCE Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.Beaumont.org\n\n']",Readers might expect to see at least one measurement indicating how much improvement was seen in the sole patient profiled in this release.

Powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room.\n\nOn one particularly bad night, Ms. DiGiusto watched from her hospital bed as doctors and nurses prepared to insert plastic tubing down her windpipe to help her breathe. Gasping for air, she was certain she would not survive.\n\n“I’ll never forget that feeling,” said Ms. DiGiusto, 65, a speech pathologist in Braintree, Mass. “The feeling that I’m never going to see my kids or husband again and that asthma is finally going to get me.”\n\nTwo years ago, Ms. DiGiusto’s doctor told her about a new procedure called bronchial thermoplasty, the first non-drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe asthma.\n\nDuring the procedure, a doctor guides a bronchoscope into a patient’s airways. There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit — cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.\n\nMs. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011. Since then, she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack. “I’m a language therapist,” she said, “but I can’t even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life.”\n\nAcross the country, about 24 million people suffer from asthma. Every year, about 3,400 die because of it.\n\nAvoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients. But for the minority with severe persistent asthma, medication and lifestyle changes are not enough. Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone — which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects — become a necessity.\n\nNationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.\n\nDoctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing. But the procedure is expensive, costing around $20,000, and insurers have been reluctant to cover it. As a result, many people who need it, doctors say, are forced to go without it.\n\n“For those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are, it’s frustrating because we have this new therapy, we’ve seen it work, and the data says it works,” said Dr. Roy St. John, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbus Pulmonary and Critical Care in Ohio. “But the big insurers have all denied it.”\n\nAlthough bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the F.D.A. only two years ago, clinical studies on it began in 2000. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure.\n\nIt takes place in three steps, each separated by about three weeks. Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.\n\nBut several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.\n\n“This isn’t a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough,” said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. “It’s not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life.” For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who — unlike a vast majority of asthma patients — cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.\n\n“There are millions and millions of asthmatics,” he said. “There will not be millions of thermoplasty patients.”\n\nStill, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty. That trial will not be completed until at least 2018.\n\nUntil then, Ms. Pisano said, many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental. “The issue here for health plans is the long-term safety and efficacy have yet to be established,” she said.\n\nBut three five-year studies have already been completed. Many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year.\n\nOne such patient, Alberto Gaulion, 68, a retired importer in Miami, estimated that for much of the last decade, his insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent about $50,000 a year on his medical care.\n\n“Every two or three weeks I had to go to the hospital,” he said, “and I was taking everything that was on the market. I was on a cocktail of drugs.”\n\nBlue Cross would not cover the procedure for him, so Mr. Gaulion paid out of pocket when he had it in 2010. Since then, he has had no hospital visits and no asthma attacks, and takes only one medication instead of five.\n\n“Now I can breathe,” he said, “and I’m saving my insurance company a fortune.”\n\nDr. Charlene McEvoy, a director of an asthma center run by Health Partners, the largest health plan in Minnesota, believed in thermoplasty enough to push the insurer to start covering it. Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.\n\n“When plans look at the cost savings, I think they’re going to cover it,” said Dr. McEvoy, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. “You have to show that there’s a return on investment.”']","We applaud this story’s attention to an issue than transcends the “study of the day” mentality of most health reporting, but we wish it had attacked the subject with a more careful and evidence-based perspective.","This premise of this story is that the insurance industry may be dragging its feet on coverage for a new FDA approved treatment for severe asthma called bronchial thermoplasty. Unfortunately, this promising argument is undermined by an inappropriate reliance on anecdotes and a highly selective reporting of the evidence that supports this treatment.

Trust me – you really don’t want to know | Tim Lott Read more\n\nAbout half of all patients with depression get no benefit from antidepressants the first time they take them and they never work for one in three people.\n\nCurrently it is impossible to establish who should or should not be given antidepressants, or combinations of them. That means that patients are tried on a succession of different drugs for 12 weeks or more and experience prolonged periods of ineffective treatment because their medication does not benefit them.\n\nOne in six Britons will suffer depression at some point in their life. Last year 61.5m prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in England.\n\nResearchers focused on two independent clinical groups of depressed patients on two biological markers that measure inflammation of the blood, as heightened levels are associated with poor response to antidepressants. They found that blood test results above certain levels reliably predicted how well patients would respond to commonly prescribed antidepressants. Their findings have been reported in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\n“The identification of biomarkers that predict treatment response is crucial in reducing the social and economic burden of depression and improving quality of life for patients,” said Prof Carmine Pariante from KCL’s institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience.\n\n“This study provides a clinically suitable approach for personalising antidepressants therapy. Patients who have blood inflammation above a certain threshold could be directed towards earlier access to more assertive antidepressant strategies, including the addition of other antidepressants or anti-inflammatory drugs,” Pariante added.\n\nDr Cosmo Hallstrom, a spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Finding biological markers for depression (and other mental illnesses) has been the holy grail of biological psychiatry.\n\n“Such a finding and a test to back it up would be critical to advancing our understanding of the biological causes of depression. It would accelerate our therapeutic interventions and make them more tailored to the needs of the patient.”\n\nBut further clinical research is needed to see if the findings can be applied in a clinical setting, Hallstrom added.\n\nStephen Buckley, head of information at the mental health charity Mind, said: “We welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications that may work for people experiencing mental health problems. These initial findings are interesting, but, as with all areas of mental health, there is still more research to be done.”\n\nMental health problems, including depression, are estimated to cost £105bn a year in England. The World Health Organisation has predicted that by 2020 depression will be the second biggest cause of health problems in the world.']","This story puts forth sensational terms, even though it’s unclear when–or if–this research will ever be put into practice in a healthcare setting.","This story describes a British study published in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology that identified two biomarkers of blood inflammation that predict the probability of a patient responding to common antidepressants.
The King’s College London researchers suggest the findings may lead to a blood test to identify patients who could benefit from more aggressive treatment including combinations of antidepressants as well as antidepressants in tandem with anti-inflammatory drugs. The story states that scientists “have developed a blood test that could identify which people with depression will respond to treatment so that patients can avoid spending months taking antidepressants that do not help them.”
While the possibility of targeted therapy is exciting, and these results look promising, the story downplays the need for more research before such a blood test could be used for patient care. Nevertheless, it puts forth sensational terms such as “breakthrough” and “holy grail” to describe the findings.

By contrast, two of those over 50 did, and late-stage polyps were almost twice as common in this age group.\n\nTo find a late-stage polyp, which may or may not turn into cancer, the researchers calculated they would have to test 23 of the people who were in their 50s.\n\nThat number was the same in younger people who had large waistlines, and even lower in those with metabolic syndrome, a combination of risk factors including belly fat, high blood pressure and high blood sugar.\n\n“It may be reasonable to offer colonoscopic screening to these individuals,” Dr. Sung Noh Hong and colleagues write in the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.\n\nOne gastroenterologist said the results were “important” but should not change practice.\n\n“This paper substantiates what we suspected, that people who are obese have higher risk of colon cancer,” Dr. John Allen, a colon cancer expert and a community practice counselor with the American Gastroenterological Association, told Reuters Health.\n\nAllen, of Minnesota Gastroenterology PA, said this risk factor might be taken into consideration when deciding when to screen, but that so far more studies were needed before recommending colonoscopy at younger ages.\n\nDuring colonoscopy, the doctor inserts a slim, flexible tube into the rectum. A camera at the tip shows the inside of the gut, so that unusual cell clumps can be found and removed.\n\nAt this point, colon cancer screening is only recommended by the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in people under 50 if a first-degree relative developed cancer at a young age.\n\nIn younger people, it is unclear that the benefits of screening offset the risks. During widely used colonoscopy, for instance, bleeding or perforation of the colon may happen in rare cases.\n\n“You want to make sure that the advantages are going to outweigh the harms,” said the American Cancer Society’s Smith.\n\nColonoscopy, used in millions of Americans every year, is just one of many methods to detect abnormalities. There are cheaper methods such as testing stool for blood, Dr. Michael L. LeFevre, of the University of Missouri in Columbia, told Reuters Health.\n\nLeFevre, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed expert panel, said the chances that a polyp turns into cancer is currently a matter of debate. As a result, he said, it is hard to know whether removing polyps in younger people would in turn lower their risk of getting cancer.\n\n“If we back screening down to age 45, does that affect mortality?” he said. “From a task force perspective, this article alone would not prompt us to look at the screening guidelines.”\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/duh54n Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, online July 16, 2010.']","We’ve stated before that how you end a piece is important framing because it may be the take-home message readers remember.  This one ended appropriately, with a US Preventive Services Task Force member saying this study alone would not lead the task force to change its screening guidelines.","This story outlines both the potential benefits and drawbacks of screening clearly and concisely.

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\n\nThe study of 130,000 women in two communities in Sweden showed 30 percent fewer women in the screening group died of breast cancer and that this effect persisted year after year.\n\nNow, 29 years after the study began, the researchers found that the number of women saved from breast cancer goes up with each year of screening.\n\n“We’ve found that the longer we look, the more lives are saved,” Professor Stephen Duffy of Queen Mary, University of London, whose study was published in the journal Radiology, said in a statement.\n\nDr. Stamatia Destounis, a radiologist at Elizabeth Wende Breast Care in Rochester, New York, who was not involved in the study, said radiologists have been quoting results of the Swedish study for years and the new findings show breast cancer screening is “even more of a benefit than we understood.”\n\nShe said sweeping changes in the U.S. screening guidelines two years ago that scaled back recommendations on breast cancer screening caused a lot of confusion among doctors and patients about the benefits of mammograms.\n\n“We’ve had to do a lot of education of the patients and their doctors. This will help for that,” Destounis said.\n\nIn the study, women were divided into two groups, one that received an invitation to have breast cancer screening and another that received usual care.\n\nThe screening phase of the trial lasted about seven years. Women between 40 and 49 were screened every two years, and women 50 to 74 were screened roughly every three years.\n\n“Our results indicate that in 1,000 women screened for 10 years, three breast cancer deaths would be prevented,” Duffy said, adding that most of the deaths prevented would have occurred more than a decade after the screening had started.\n\n“This indicates that the long-term benefits of screening in terms of deaths prevented are more than double those often quoted for short-term follow-up.”\n\nThe new data adds to evidence on the long-term benefits of regular mammography screening.\n\nSCREENING CONTROVERSY\n\nNew breast screening recommendations issued in 2009 by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an influential advisory group, recommended against routine mammograms for women in their 40s and said women in their 50s should get mammograms every other year instead of every year.\n\nThe guidelines contradicted years of messages about the need for routine breast cancer screening starting at age 40, eliciting protests from breast cancer experts and advocacy groups who argued the recommendation for fewer screenings would confuse women and result in more deaths from breast cancer.\n\nThe changes were meant to spare women some of the worry and expense of extra tests needed to distinguish between cancer and harmless lumps. But the latest results from the Swedish study show the rate of false positive results was low.\n\n“We saw the actual number of overdiagnosed cases was really very small — less than 5 percent of the total,” Robert Smith, director of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society and one of the study’s authors, said in a telephone interview.\n\nMany groups, including the American Cancer Society, have stuck by their long-standing recommendations of a yearly breast exam for women starting at age 40, stressing that the breast X-rays have been proven to save lives by spotting tumors early, when they are most easily treated.\n\n“I think for anybody who was beginning to have their faith shaken in the value of mammography, these data show mammography is quite valuable as a public health approach to reducing deaths from breast cancer,” Smith said.\n\nDuffy said he thinks screening women 40 to 54 every 18 months and screening women 55 and older every two years would be a reasonable schedule.\n\nHe said the new findings do not speak to the frequency of screening issue, but they do make clear that screening works.\n\n“Everyone must make up their own mind, but certainly from combined results from all the screening trials, mammography in women aged 40-49 does reduce deaths from breast cancer,” he said.\n\nBreast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women, after lung cancer. It kills 500,000 people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to 1.3 million people around the world.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was a confusing story – confusing readers by evoking the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force controversy – and then never including a USPSTF response. </span>","This story reports on the results of a long-term Swedish study showing that 29 years after their first mammogram, women who were invited to get routine screening had a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality compared to those who received usual care.

The story allows supporters to say that the new approach, which involves using extreme cold to destroy nerve tissue (a technique known as cryoablation), “could someday become a standard treatment” for PE. But the study discussed here doesn’t come close to the evidence needed to justify such a bold claim. The story also didn’t apply quite enough scrutiny to statistics regarding the prevalance of PE (which struck us as disease-mongering), nor did it explain whether the improvement in stamina reported by the researchers made a difference in the men’s sexual satisfaction – or that of their partners. Those significant concerns aside, we thought the story did a good job of explaining the nuts and bolts of how the procedure works. We also liked that it raised questions about the durability of the treatment and potential for long-term adverse effects.

However, for the first time, a clinical trial has revealed metformin can promote a patient\'s ability to repair their own damaged blood vessels by increasing vascular stem cells.\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of illness in diabetic patients, accounting for more than half of all fatalities. Metformin may be used to lower Type 1 diabetic patients\' risk of developing this complication.\n\nFindings of the clinical trial are published today in the journal, Cardiovascular Diabetology. This follows previous laboratory work at Newcastle University which explored the mechanism behind metformin.\n\nDr Jolanta Weaver, Senior Lecturer in Diabetes Medicine at Newcastle University and Honorary Consultant Diabetologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, led both studies.\n\nShe believes this new research is a major development in understanding the best ways to further improve treatment in Type 1 diabetes.\n\nDr Weaver said: ""As the outcomes of heart disease is worse in diabetic versus non-diabetic patients, there is a need to identify additional treatment options.\n\n""Metformin could routinely be used by patients with Type 1 diabetes to help lower their chances of developing heart disease, by increasing a repair mechanism created by vascular stem cells released from the bone marrow.\n\n""Our research is an exciting step forward as it may have positive clinical implications for patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease by improving their treatment options.\n\n""For the first time, this study has shown metformin has additional benefit beyond improving diabetes control when given to patients with relatively well controlled Type 1 diabetes.\n\n""We have established the drug increases patients own vascular stem cells, which will help delay or slowdown heart disease.\n\n""Our findings also show that the cells associated with damaged blood vessels were reduced, confirming that the repair of blood vessels was taking place in our patients.""\n\nResearchers studied a treatment group of 23 people aged 19-64 who had Type 1 diabetes for up to 23 years and had no evidence of heart disease.\n\nPatients were given metformin at a dose they could tolerate, between one to three tablets a day, for eight weeks. Participants were advised to adjust their insulin to keep blood glucose levels safe.\n\nScientists measured patients\' stem cells directly in the blood and also grew stem cells in a test tube, observing how they behaved. Another cell type was also counted to assess damaged blood vessels.\n\nThe participants were matched with nine patients within the same age bracket who took standard insulin treatment and 23 healthy non-diabetic people aged 20-64.\n\nExperts found that the stem cells of patients who took metformin were able to promote the repair of the blood vessels and there was an improvement in how vascular stem cells worked.\n\nType 1 diabetes is a lifelong autoimmune condition that develops when the pancreas does not produce any insulin, causing a person\'s blood sugar level to become too high. It is estimated around 400,000 people in the UK have the condition.\n\nDr Weaver said: ""We have shown that all our patients in the study had their insulin doses reduced after taking metformin and have not suffered any serious adverse effect.\n\n""Patients with Type 1 diabetes may wish to consider discussing with their GP the possibility of adding metformin, even at a very low dose, to the insulin that they are taking.

Based on a reduction in markers indicating blood vessel damage, and an increase in markers indicating blood vessel repair, the researchers conclude the risk is lowered, but the study wasn’t designed in a way that would show an actual risk reduction. Thus, claims such as this one by the study researchers — “this study has shown metformin has additional benefit beyond improving diabetes control when given to patients with relatively well controlled Type 1 diabetes” — represent an overreach, because the study wasn’t capable of showing a benefit on any outcome that would actually matter to a patient. Additionally, the release offers no numerical data on changes in levels of the measured markers — only general statements. Nor does it mention the cost of the drug, which is nominal, but which could garner a large sales market. Lastly, it offers a patient testimonial by way of anecdotal information which may or may not be representative of the experiences of others.

They are live microorganisms—or ""good"" bacteria—that when consumed in capsules or yogurt are said to confer a health benefit. So far, however, there is little scientific proof of their effectiveness—many studies of probiotics have involved less-than-rigorous research standards.\n\nAs further data become available, some researchers believe probiotics may evolve into prescription drugs, as doctors focus on specific bacteria strains to target patients\' particular conditions. At the moment, however, many experts say probiotics are misunderstood.\n\n""Consumers have shown to be willing to spend the money, just in case [probiotics] work,"" says Michael Fischbach, an assistant professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. ""What we all have to be careful about is to not view them as a panacea and to make sure that we don\'t raise our expectations too high.""\n\nActivia is one of a number of yogurts that contain probiotics. Dannon\n\nU.S. sales of probiotic supplements totaled nearly $770 million last year, up some 22% from the previous year, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm.\n\nThe strongest clinical studies have suggested some probiotics may be beneficial for certain gastrointestinal problems, allergies and vaginal infections. Many doctors recommend probiotics when patients are taking antibiotics. Probiotics are widely considered safe except for people with an impaired immune system, though experts recommend talking to a doctor first.\n\nFor other ailments, hundreds of probiotic studies are currently under way, experts say. In a report last month in the British Journal of Nutrition, researchers at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-School of Health Related Professions said a combination of two probiotics may reduce the symptoms and recovery time for the common cold. Other studies have shown similar results, especially with children.\n\nResearchers this month presented evidence at a meeting of the American Heart Association showing that two daily doses of a probiotic lowered bad cholesterol by nearly 12% and reduced total and saturated cholesterol esters which contribute to the hardening of arteries. The study was funded by Micropharma Ltd., a Canadian probiotic research and production company.\n\nSome studies have federal backing. UCSF is exploring possible effects of probiotics on infants and early markers of asthma, as well as on colic. Harvard Medical School researchers are studying what good bacteria might do for the immune system to see if the response to flu vaccine in elderly people can be improved.\n\nThe body contains trillions of bacteria, both good and bad. Most live in the gut but they also colonize other areas. Good bacteria help digest food, produce vitamins and protect from infections, among other things.\n\nThe Flora Inside Probiotics are \'good\' bacteria believed to confer health benefits.

Probiotics are largely unregulated but they can\'t make claims to cure or prevent a disease.\n\nThe community of bacteria, the body\'s intestinal flora, begins at birth, says Esi Lamousé-Smith, an instructor in medicine at Boston Children\'s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. By age 3 these bacteria, sometimes referred to as our gut or intestinal microbiome, are more or less set, she says. Each person\'s microbiome is distinct and doesn\'t change significantly with age unless a person becomes ill, takes an antibiotic or makes major changes in diet.\n\nA probiotic, which adds good bacteria only for the time it is being taken, seems to influence other bacteria already present. For example, it might stimulate other bacteria to turn on or off certain genes. These genes, in turn, might be involved in various functions, such as immune regulation or nutrient metabolism.\n\n""I am wholeheartedly a believer"" in probiotics, says Maureen Fitzgerald, a Germantown, Wis., resident who blogs about parenting issues.\n\nAs a former teacher, Ms. Fitzgerald was exposed to many germs and says she was looking for something to ""beef up"" her immune system. Once she started regularly taking probiotics she says she wasn\'t ""getting as many of the colds and the bugs that are around."" About five years ago, Ms. Fitzgerald\'s then 3-year-old son began taking a children\'s probiotic that cleared up digestion problems he was having. After that, Ms. Fitzgerald says she was hooked on the supplements. She raved about probiotics on her blog and has since received free samples, which she reviews.\n\nThere are many different strains of probiotics and each may affect the body differently. The dosage—or number of colony-forming units—in a probiotic is also important. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are the two most widely studied types of probiotics. Lactobacillus rhamnosus, widely known as LGG, may treat viral and antibiotic-induced diarrhea, and certain allergies, like childhood eczema. A strain of Lactobacillus reuteri has been shown to help with colic. Bifidobacterium animalis, found in some brands of yogurt, is said to improve digestion.\n\nExperts say taking a probiotic supplement with many bacterial strains isn\'t necessarily better. The key is ensuring each strain in a product is active and has been clinically proven to work at a certain dosage, they say. Tests done by ConsumerLab.com have shown that the number of living organisms in probiotics doesn\'t always reflect the label. Of 12 products tested this year, two delivered fewer organisms than listed.\n\nProbiotics aren\'t required to obtain Food and Drug Administration approval before being marketed. ""Right now they\'re considered a food product or dietary supplement, not a drug,"" says Gerard Mullin, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and author of ""The Inside Tract.""\n\nThere aren\'t any FDA approved health claims for probiotics, says Diane Hoffmann, a law professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law, who oversaw a study on the federal regulation of probiotics. But companies can make broader statements, called ""structure function"" claims. It is the difference between saying a product reduces the risk of heart disease versus supports a healthy heart. Because the difference isn\'t discernible to many consumers, there is little incentive in the industry to pursue costlier and more resource-intensive health claims.\n\n""Consumers just need to know that claims are not necessarily preapproved and they may not be well substantiated,"" says Ms. Hoffmann.\n\nIn the short term, experts recommend sticking with the strains of probiotics that have a lot of science behind them, like Lactobacillus GG, and brands that have proven to be safe and truthful in labeling.\n\nDr. Mullin, of Johns Hopkins, says the future may lie in concocting specific probiotics for people based upon their individual needs and microbiomes.\n\nWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com']",An extensive and well-written overview of some of the health claims that are being made about probiotics.

Too much PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, only sometimes signals prostate cancer is brewing — it also can mean a benign enlarged prostate or an infection. And screening often detects small tumors that will prove too slow-growing to be deadly. Yet there\'s no sure way to tell in advance who needs aggressive therapy.\n\nOn the other hand, some men have cancer despite a ""normal"" PSA count of 4 or below. So for PSAs that are rising, yet still in the normal range, some guidelines urge doctors to consider a biopsy.\n\nHow quickly the PSA number rises is something ""that patients and doctors worry a lot about,"" said Dr. Andrew Vickers of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. ""Men show up here with a PSA of 2 and we say, \'Why are you here?\' And they say, \'Well, I used to be a 1 and my doctor\'s worried.

No statistically significant differences were found between the two treatment arms. Previous observational studies had suggested that acetaminophen could exacerbate asthma symptoms in young children.
This University Hospitals Case Medical Center news release does a good job summing up much of the relevant information, but more elaboration with data backing up the claims would have been helpful for busy reporters covering this important topic. Compared to a news release by Boston Children’s Hospital, which we also reviewed, this release omitted quantitative data needed to back up its statements, especially those addressing benefits and harms such as no “significant differences in safety [found] between the two drugs.” As we had noted in previous news releases, the word “significant” here is supposed to mean “statistically significant” – a fact that’s often not clear. The University Hospitals news release also could have been more explicit in explaining the importance of the study, given its context. Finally, although the news release correctly points out that caregivers used either acetaminophen or ibuprofen, it suggests the brand names Tylenol and Advil/Motrin were given to participants, when researchers actually administered Little Fevers by Little Remedies and Children’s Advil.
A short discussion of costs would have been beneficial in the news release, since acetaminophen (Little Remedies) generally tends to be more expensive than ibuprofen (Children’s Advil).

It has almost 100,000 entries.\n\nThe app is designed to record how using marijuana corresponds to changes in the intensity of symptoms and any side effects a person experiences. It helps ""track and learn which types of cannabis, dosing and ingestion methods work best.""\n\nThe study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology found that users suffering from 27 different health conditions with symptoms ranging from seizures to depression reported a mean reduction in symptoms of 2.8 to 4.6 points on a zero to 10 point scale after consuming cannabis in various forms, including concentrates and topicals. People using the drug to treat anxiety- and depression-related symptoms reported more relief than people with pain symptoms.\n\nIn the second study, researchers examined how cannabis buds treated insomnia. Cannabis users on the Releaf App experienced a reduction of symptom severity of an average 4.5 points on a zero to 10 point scale. According to the study, people who consumed the drug via pipes and vaporizers experienced greater relief of symptoms, and those who vaped experienced fewer negative effects.\n\nAccording to the release, data from the app showed that an overall 94 percent of cannabis users suffering from a variety of health conditions reported that the intensity of their symptoms was reduced after consuming the drug. Additionally, use of marijuana was associated with non-serious side effects.\n\n""If the results found in our studies can be extrapolated to the general population, cannabis could systematically replace multi-billion dollar medication industries around the world. It is likely already beginning to do so,"" Jacob Vigil, co-author of the studies, said in the release.']",The story doesn’t address numerous limitations with this research and failed to scrutinize the quality of the evidence.,"This story drew largely from a news release about two studies purporting to show sweeping health benefits of marijuana, based on user-reported data from the Releaf phone app.
There was no critical examination of the underlying evidence, and this story is basically providing free marketing for all sorts of things the authors of the study have financial stakes in.

Now, the field includes a slew of new drinks promising a better night\'s sleep using such ingredients as melatonin, valerian root and - think turkey - tryptophan.\n\nThey have apt names such as Unwind, iChill and Dream Water, and offer such flavors as Berry-Berry Tired, Snoozeberry and Lullaby Lemon. They\'re the inverse of energy drinks. Consumers can wake up with Red Bull and then wind down with Slow Cow.\n\nBut can consumers trust these fruity concoctions to give them their z\'s?\n\nAccording to Steven M. Scharf, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, the answer is a resounding maybe.\n\n""The issue is this: Some of them probably have some biologic effect, but they haven\'t been as well studied as you\'d like,"" Scharf says. ""Nobody\'s ever compared valerian root to [the prescription sleep aid] Ambien.""\n\nThe chief ingredient in many of these beverages is melatonin, a hormone that induces sleepiness and helps coordinate the body\'s biological clock. It\'s typically released by the pineal gland around 10 p.m.; secretion stops around 4 or 5 a.m., helping to trigger the body to wake up, Scharf says.\n\nThe body produces about three-fourths of a milligram of melatonin a day. The manufacturer of the sleep aid Snooz\'n says its 2.5-ounce ""shots"" contain five milligrams of melatonin; Unwind, a ""relaxation blend,"" has three milligrams per 12-ounce can.\n\nOral doses of melatonin haven\'t worked much better at inducing sleep than a placebo in most studies, Scharf says, and a single, concentrated shot of the stuff doesn\'t exactly mimic the body\'s time-release system. However, a study published in January in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that a pre-bedtime cocktail of magnesium, zinc and a five-milligram dose of melatonin significantly improved sleep among a group of 43 elderly Italian insomniacs.\n\nJason Healy, the head of InterMark Brands, which markets Snooz\'n, says he drinks his product on nights when he is stressed-out or when he is traveling internationally. The back of the Snooz\'n bottle says the beverage will ""combat stress, energy drinks and sleeplessness"" and takes about 30 minutes to take effect. When it launches nationally in March, Snooz\'n will be available in grocery and convenience stores and pharmacies, like most of these drinks.\n\n""We attack [insomnia] from two angles,"" Healy says. ""You\'ve got to turn off all the stimulants and also get into a natural sleep cycle.""\n\nMelatonin is used for the latter, while ingredients such as valerian root and chamomile take care of the former, Healy says. Both of those herbs are associated with soporific effects, according to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database. Valerian root has properties that resemble the benzodiazepine class of medications (such as Valium and Xanax), but Scharf says he has no idea how they compare with standard sleeping pills because of the lack of comparative studies.\n\nFinding a niche\n\n\n\nContainers of relaxation drinks look similar to those of energy drinks. Many mimic the diminutive shape of the 5-Hour Energy shot or the bright graphics and tall, narrow can of Rockstar or Monster. Flavors range from a pleasant, fruit-flavored soda to just shy of cough syrup.\n\nMany relaxation beverages contain safety labels that warn consumers that they should neither drive or operate machinery after drinking them, nor mix them with alcohol. Some say they aren\'t intended for people younger than 18 or for pregnant or nursing women - a warning that the Food and Drug Administration has also made about melatonin.\n\nIn January 2010, the FDA sent a warning letter to the Innovative Beverage Group, which makes the relaxation beverage Drank, saying the melatonin it uses is an ""unapproved food additive"" and not ""generally recognized as safe.""\n\nDrank is still being sold with melatonin in it. In a statement, Drank inventor Peter Bianchi says ""the safety of Drank\'s consumers remains a top priority"" and the company is working to modify the product\'s packaging and marketing ""to reflect its classification as a dietary supplement.""\n\nThe FDA regulates conventional beverages\' ingredients and labeling claims more strictly than those of dietary supplements. Drank is still classified as a beverage.\n\nThe relaxation drink market is tiny compared with the energy drink market, says Garima Goel Lal, a senior analyst at the consumer research firm Mintel.\n\nA Mintel survey found that 48 percent of all ""functional beverage"" users said they were looking for beverages to release stress.\n\nA functional beverage - the term is used for sport, energy and relaxation drinks - is a nonalcoholic drink that claims to have health benefits. The number of nonalcoholic beverages making relaxation claims continues to rise; 40 new ones came on the market in 2010, according to Mintel. The field is too young to identify the leaders and the losers, Goel Lal says.\n\n""They\'re trying to find a niche,"" she says.\n\nMultiple choices\n\n\n\nKatherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has blogged about relaxation drinks. She says that people with certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure, should consult their physician before downing a can of Unwind or any of the other sleep beverages.\n\n""A person can just go to the convenience store and purchase this,"" Zeratsky says. ""There\'s this perception that it\'s safe and, depending on the person, it might not be a good choice.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">In reporting on a new wave of products, the story’s major shortcoming was the lack of discussion about lifestyle/behavior changes, which are the long term solutions for insomnia.</span>","This story reported on so-called “relaxation drinks” that contain melatonin, valerian, and other supplements that marketers say will help put you to sleep.

For cigarette smokers who waver at the edge of a decision to quit and consider strategies to ease the transition, a new study finds that the all-in approach is more likely to work than wading in slowly.\n\nIn a clinical trial that pitted would-be quitters who stopped smoking altogether on quit day against those directed to wean themselves off the butts over two weeks, researchers found that those who went cold turkey were more likely than gradual taperers to succeed in quitting for four weeks and for six months.\n\nThe differences weren’t overwhelming: at four weeks, 39.2% of the gradualists were no longer smoking, compared to 49% of the do-it-nowers. At six months 15.5% of the gradualists and 22% of those who stopped smoking on quit day were “former smokers.” But in a group of this size, those differences are considered statistical proof that quitting abruptly is a superior strategy to tiptoeing into the decision.\n\nThe study was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose numbers also underscore a somewhat depressing truth among cigarette smokers wishing to quit: Failure is common. Most studies have shown that roughly one-in-four quitters who use medicines to aid in their effort is able to remain abstinent for six months, and many who make it that far subsequently relapse. Successful quitters tend to have one thing in common: Most of them tried to quit many times before succeeding.\n\nThe study was conducted in Great Britain, where participants included 697 people who smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day or who had diminished lung capacity consistent with regular smoking. To participate, subjects had to agree to quit within two weeks of enrollment. They were then assigned to either an abrupt-quit or gradual-quit group.\n\nEnrollees in the gradual-quit group did get to choose whether, in the two-week period over which they were to stop smoking, they would taper their daily cigarettes, observe smoke-free periods, or smoke on a schedule. While they followed those gradual-quit patterns, they wore nicotine patches and got fast-acting nicotine products, including gum, tablets, lozenges and sprays.\n\nAt a nurse visit one week before their final-quit day, the gradualists had reduced their cigarette consumption, on average, by 48% -- just short of the 50% goal. By quit-day, they had reduced on average by 68% (short of the 75% goal).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe abrupt-quitters were issued nicotine patches, which they wore for the two weeks leading up to their “quit day.” After that, they were issued nicotine-replacement products to ease their withdrawal. And despite being told not to alter their smoking patterns as their quit-day approached, they did decrease their smoking by an average of 29%.\n\nAfter the two-week period was up and cessation began in both conditions, both groups experienced withdrawal symptoms and urge intensities that were roughly the same.\n\nThe provision not only of nicotine-replacement products but of schedules, structure and professional encouragement for gradual quitters likely “optimized” those participants’ likelihood of success, the researchers said. And yet, their success rates still fell well below those of abrupt-quitters.\n\nThe latest finding falls in line with other research on quitting. It may be that those who choose to quit gradually are not as committed to quitting as are those willing to take the plunge, but since participants here were randomized to their condition, this study suggests that different levels of motivation might not fully explain the different rates of success.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that this is hardly the last word on the best way to quit. In a large population of smokers, the gradual approach might feel kinder and gentler to many smokers, and prompt more to attempt quitting more often. Quitting gradually is, at least, sometimes successful. So, over time and in a large population, getting more people to try might result in greater reductions in smoking than abrupt quitting, they acknowledge.\n\nHere’s what the American Cancer Society says about quitting, and the often-discouraging statistics:\n\n“The truth is that quit smoking programs, like other programs that treat addictions, often have fairly low success rates. But that doesn’t mean they’re not worthwhile or that you should be discouraged. Your own success in quitting and staying that way is what really counts, and you have some control over that. Even if you don’t succeed the first few times, keep trying. You can learn from your mistakes so that you’ll be ready for those pitfalls next time.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @LATMelissaHealy and “like” Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.']","Is going cold turkey better than gradually cutting back on cigarettes? The LA Times does a good job explaining a new study examining this question, but the story lacked comments from an independent source–or even one of the researchers.","This story looks at a study that investigated whether going cold turkey (quitting abruptly) is more effective than cutting back gradually. The article does a good job quantifying the benefits, and informing readers of the quality of the research.

On fertile days, users must abstain from sex or use other protection such as condoms to prevent pregnancy. The app was approved as a class IIb medical device by Tüv Süd, a notified body in Sweden where it is based.\n\nBut sexual health organisations are warning that being classed as a medical device does not guarantee that the app will effectively prevent pregnancy. Sexual health charity the FPA, Fertility UK, and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are jointly calling for more large-scale independent trials to ensure that evidence for such apps is on a par with other rigorously tested methods of contraception.\n\nNatural Cycles is one of numerous apps that help women practise a method of contraception called natural family planning, also known as the fertility awareness method.\n\n\n\nNatural family planning involves monitoring your body for signs of ovulation, like an increase in your temperature, or a change in cervical mucus.\n\n""The thing about the female egg is that it only lives for about 24 hours. So if you could reliably know when you\'ve ovulated as a woman, and then you give that egg two or three days to die, any time after that in the cycle you will not get pregnant because there\'s no egg to fertilise,"" Dr Susan Walker, a senior lecturer in sexual health at Anglia Ruskin University, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\n\nTaking your temperature is what sets Natural Cycles and other apps like it apart from standard period-tracking apps. Without temperature information an app can can guess at your ovulation day based on your average cycle length, but can\'t be sure when you actually have ovulated, and so you can\'t use it as a reliable form of birth control.\n\nYou don\'t actually need an app to practise natural family planning – although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you’re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators – temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions.\n\nBut natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs.\n\nAnd if you\'re considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won\'t like having to remember to take your temperature every morning.\n\n""You really have to commit to it, whether you\'re doing it the traditional way or you\'re using an app. You have to take your temperature every morning and record that, because without all that data it\'s not really any use to you,"" Bekki Burbidge, head of communications at the FPA, told BuzzFeed News. ""It\'s not a method that\'s going to suit everybody.""\n\nBut for women like Natural Cycles co-founder Dr Elina Berglund, who want an alternative to hormonal contraception, it\'s an option worth pursuing. Along with her husband and co-founder Dr Raoul Scherwitzl, Berglund created the algorithm used in the app for personal use, before deciding it was something she should share with the rest of the world.\n\n""When it comes to contraception it\'s all about choice. It\'s not like one solution will fit all women,"" said Berglund.\n\n""Our typical user is in a stable relationship a few years before wanting to have kids. At first she starts to use the app to prevent pregnancy, and when she\'s ready [to get pregnant] she switches to plan, and usually she gets pregnant quite quickly, because the app already knows her body and cycle.""\n\n\n\nTo use the app, you need a monthly or yearly subscription, and a thermometer that you have to use to take your temperature each morning before you get out of bed.\n\n\n\nThe app then tells you if you\'re likely to be fertile or not that day. And if the app gives you a ""red day"" – meaning you could be fertile – you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.']","The story is balanced, provides an excellent summary of the research on the app’s effectiveness for preventing pregnancy, and makes clear the limits of the evidence.","BuzzFeed’s take on an app to aid in birth control ends up being a very informative piece on the plusses and minuses of a variety of birth control methods. With the context provided, readers learn a bit about a woman’s monthly cycle and how so-called natural family planning works. This method is an alternative to such contraceptive stalwarts as the pill and the IUD, and serves a population that may have reason to avoid more medical interventions requiring doctor’s visits.
We especially appreciated that the writer noted that users must be diligent to get the best results: “And if you’re considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won’t like having to remember to take your temperature every morning.”

Its discussion of FDA rules governing device approvals is valuable.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of rapid, irregular heartbeat that puts people at increased risk for stroke. Approving new devices or surgical techniques to help reduce risk for these patients is important, and so this story is important for helping raise the alarm about a device that might not be safe enough and might need further testing. This story does a good job with several layers of complexity — how the regulatory process may have a loophole, the freedom doctors have to use devices off-label, and the new study that concludes by recommending surgeons should hold off on using the new Lariat device until more studies are done. These strengths notwithstanding, the story could have done a better job of describing current practices to prevent strokes in patients with AF and how this device may or may not be an additional option. It is known that a variety of blood thinners can significantly decrease the risk of stroke in patients with AF. However, there are risks associated with these blood thinners, including bleeding (including life-threatening bleeds in the brain that can be as serious as the effect of the blood clot they are trying to prevent), that mean not all patients can use them.

Unfortunately, new research reported Wednesday suggests that there is little women can do other than grin and bear it, since there appear to be no effective treatments.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry once weighed in on the issue heavily, with the result being the introduction of the now-notorious thalidomide, which caused severe birth defects in a large number of infants. That episode led to increased requirements for safety screening of drugs before they are marketed and led to the still-prevalent consensus that it is generally not safe for women to take drugs during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, when morning sickness is at its worst. That has led many women to try alternative treatments, including sugar solutions, ginger, vitamin B6, acupressure and acupuncture. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that any of them are effective, Dr. Anne Matthews of the School of Nursing at Ireland’s Dublin City University reported Wednesday in the Cochrane Library, a prestigious source of research on the effectiveness of medical treatments.\n\nAs many as 85% of pregnant women experience nausea, and half of those endure actual vomiting. The cause is unknown, but researchers suspect hormonal imbalances. About 1 in 200 suffer so severely that they cannot keep any food or liquids down, a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum. It requires medical treatment and can cause blood clots and damage to the infant. On the plus side, a 2007 study found that women who suffer morning sickness are less likely to develop breast cancer.\n\nMatthews and her colleagues reviewed 27 clinical trials involving 4,041 pregnant women who were as much as 20 weeks pregnant. In six studies of acupuncture and two of acupressure -- in which pressure is applied to acupuncture sites rather than needles -- they found no benefit. One study of acustimulation, in which a small electric current is applied through the needles, found some benefit over three weeks. There was also very little evidence to support the benefits of ginger (which actually made many women sick), vitamin B6, antihistamines and anti-vomiting drugs. The anti-vomiting drugs induced sleepiness in recipients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“A number of the studies we looked at appeared to show benefits, but in general the results were inconsistent and it was difficult to draw firm conclusions about any one treatment in particular,” Matthews said in a statement. “We were also unable to obtain much information about whether these treatments are actually making a difference in women’s quality of life.”\n\nYour best bet, according to most experts: Get plenty of rest, drink a little at a time but often to prevent dehydration, and eat small servings of bland food such as toast and crackers. Also, avoid strong smells; eating food cold rather than hot can minimize odors that cause nausea.\n\n-- Thomas H. Maugh II / Los Angeles Times']","The weaker of the two stories we reviewed on the Cochrane Library’s morning sickness review, this piece skipped too many of the important details and left readers with an incomplete picture of the study’s compelling findings.","We usually like it when stories approach an issue from a suspicious, ""show me the evidence"" perspective. But in this case, the story’s doubtful take on treatments for morning sickness just isn’t backed up by solid reporting. Unlike the NPR story we reviewed, this story did not attempt to provide a thorough analysis of the Cochrane Library’s review of morning sickness research. headline and lead misstate the main findings of the study being covered, and the story glosses over important details about how that study was conducted. What’s more, a quote and much of the content appear to have been taken from a press release issued by a journal publisher about the study.

Building upon previous research, the study challenges the widely held belief that recovery from a TBI is limited to two years after an injury.\n\n""A TBI disrupts brain structure. These brain changes can interfere with brain network communication and the cognitive functions those networks support,"" said Dr. Kihwan Han, research scientist at the Center for BrainHealth and lead author of the study.\n\n""For people with chronic TBI, they may have trouble with daily tasks such as creating shopping lists and resolving conflicts with others for many years after the injury. These findings provide hope for people who thought, \'This is as good as my recovery is going to get\' and for the medical community who have yet to find a way to objectively measure a patient\'s recovery,"" he said.\n\nThe study included 60 adults with TBI symptoms lasting an average of eight years. Participants were randomly placed into one of two cognitive training groups: strategy-based training or knowledge-based training. Over an eight-week period, the strategy-based training group learned strategies to improve attention and reasoning. The knowledge-based training group learned information about the structure and function of the brain as well as the effects of sleep and exercise on brain performance.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging measured cortical thickness and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) before training, after training and three months post-training. Previous studies have shown that cortical thickness and rsFC can be potential markers for training-induced brain changes.\n\nIndividuals in the strategy-based reasoning training showed a greater change in cortical thickness and connectivity compared to individuals who received the knowledge-based training. Changes in cortical thickness and functional connectivity also correlated to an individual\'s ability to switch between tasks quickly and consistently to achieve a specific goal.\n\n""People who showed the greatest change in cortical thickness and connectivity, showed the greatest performance increases in our cognitive tasks. Perhaps future studies could investigate the added benefit of brain stimulation treatments in combination with cognitive training for individuals with chronic TBI who experience problems with attention, memory or executive functions,"" Han said.\n\n###\n\nThe work was supported by the Department of Defense, the Meadows Foundation and the Friends of BrainHealth Distinguished New Scientist Award.']",The release doesn’t tell us how physiological changes in the brain translate to meaningful cognitive improvements for a person living with long-term TBI.,"This news release from the Center for BrainHealth at the  University of Texas at Dallas describes findings from a recent study on the effects of brain training for people with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI). The release is a little fuzzy on the details.
The news release should have included numbers to put the benefits in context and explained how changes in cortical thickness — the main outcome studied — translates to cognitive improvements (and what types of improvements) for a person living with long-term TBI.
