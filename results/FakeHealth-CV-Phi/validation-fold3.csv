More than one-fifth of people dropped out when they couldn’t tolerate the supplement’s taste, texture and side effects.\n\nResearchers have explored the potential of seaweed as an appetite suppressant, but so far products haven’t panned out.\n\n“There have been problems in the past to develop something (that tastes) acceptable,” said Dr. Arne Astrup, one of the study’s authors from the University of Copenhagen and a member of the advisory board to S-Biotek, a Danish company that provided funding for the study.\n\nPrevious seaweed-based supplements were slimy and caused bloating, and they also had a fishy taste. The new supplement used in this study is less unpleasant — but there’s still room for improvement, said Astrup.\n\nThe supplement is based on the seaweed extract alginate, a thickening agent and a common ingredient in foods like soups and jellies. It’s also increasingly used by the weight-loss industry, marketed as an appetite suppressant.\n\nPackaged in powder form and mixed with liquid, alginate expands in the stomach to form a thick gel, mimicking the effect of a large meal.\n\n“This gel is really like a pudding that will last in the stomach for hours, gradually degrading and disappearing,” Astrup said.\n\nFor the study, the researchers randomly divided 96 generally healthy but obese people, aged 20 to 55, into two groups.\n\nOne group was given packets of the gel supplement, containing 15 grams of fiber, and the other got a seaweed-free placebo drink. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving the seaweed supplement.\n\nIn terms of calories, flavor and appearance, the placebo and treatment drink were identical.\n\nFor three months, study participants drank the supplements, dissolved in two cups of water, 30 minutes before each meal. They were also told to cut back on calories. By the end of the trial, sixteen people had dropped out of the study, including 10 out of 48 from the seaweed group, according to findings published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\n\nAmong people who stuck with the trial, those on the fiber supplement lost 15 pounds, on average, compared to 11 pounds in the placebo group. But when all 96 original participants were included in the analysis, the researchers found no significant difference in weight loss between the two treatment groups.\n\nTREAT FINDINGS ‘WITH CAUTION’\n\nPrevious studies have shown eating a high-fiber diet can help reduce the hunger pangs that may lead to over-eating and derail a healthy diet plan.\n\nStill, the new results should be treated with caution, according to Dr. Maria Vazquez Roque, who has worked on alginate-based gels at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, but was not involved in the study. Just looking at the effect of the supplement on people who finished the treatment can bias the findings, she said.\n\nFor Mette Kristensen, one of the study’s authors, the message seems clear: “If you actually comply with the treatment, you do have the improvement in weight loss.”\n\nHowever, effects on blood pressure were less promising. Systolic blood pressure — the top number on a blood pressure reading — fell by almost six points on average in the placebo group over the 12-week study, but by just over one point in the treatment group. At times during the trials, systolic blood pressure increased in the alginate group by one to two points.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the higher sodium content of the alginate drink — a little over one gram per dose, or about half a teaspoon of salt — could have offset any potential blood-pressure reducing effect of the supplement. The American Heart Association recommends that adults eat less than 1.5 g of sodium per day.\n\nQuestions remain about the safety of the fiber supplement over the long term. Five people taking the fiber gel left the study due to problems with stomach bloating, nausea and diarrhea. Two people taking a placebo supplement, which didn’t contain the seaweed fiber, experienced similar problems.\n\nThere are many different types of alginate, said Richard Mattes, who has studied the effect of alginate fiber on appetite at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana — so the trick is to find the right alginate in the right dose.\n\nAnd just feeling less hungry due to a supplement won’t make you lose weight unless you eat fewer calories, said Mattes, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nThe research group is working on a new supplement that uses 80 percent less alginate, with less sodium, better taste and fewer side effects than the current formula, Astrup told Reuters Health.\n\nAlginate as an aid to weight loss is already commercially available in pill form and costs around $45 for a seven-day supply. These supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, said Vazquez Roque.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/LSuLvS American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, online May 30, 2012.']","There are so many ways a story about seaweed for weight loss could have been hyped.  This story, though, artfully dodged all of those ways, stuck to the evidence, and gave a thorough report.

Though there were observational studies, those may be biased because men who opt to hold off on treatment may be those whose tumors are lower risk to begin with, he said.\n\nThe study is published in the June 6 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nWatchful waiting -- which does not involve cancer treatment -- means having regular exams while keeping an eye on the tumor to see if it grows or spreads. It is usually recommended when doctors feel someone\'s advanced age will allow them to outlive the generally slow-moving cancer or when someone has other conditions that are more likely to prove lethal.\n\nMen who are diagnosed with early prostate cancer -- meaning it\'s confined to the prostate gland and has not spread -- are confronted with a bewildering array of options for treating it: surgery; radiation; drugs to deprive the tumor of the hormone androgen that may drive its growth; or watchful waiting.\n\nIn 2008, AHRQ also commissioned a review of studies on other prostate cancer treatment options, but that report could not draw conclusions on the best approach either.\n\n""What all of these analyses have found is there is very limited data that allows us to determine which of these approaches in the best approach,"" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nBrooks said more comparative effectiveness research, which compares different kinds of treatments, is needed.\n\nIn the meantime, what are men diagnosed with early prostate cancer to do?\n\nMen and their doctors need to consider what the tumor looks like under the microscope, which can help gauge how aggressive it may be. They should also consider age and overall health status, including whether or not the patient has other conditions more likely to cause death than the prostate cancer.\n\nFinally, patients and their doctors should weight the potential debilitating side effects of the treatments, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction, against how comfortable the man is with holding off on treatment, experts say.\n\n""Men need to learn as much as they can about the possible outcomes and benefits of the various treatments and the potential side effects, and choose which direction they are most comfortable with,"" Brooks said.\n\nIn the current review, researchers found several trials that compared different doses of radiation and different types of radiation therapy, including external beam radiation therapy, in which a radiation is delivered through a beam through the skin, or brachytherapy, in which radioactive isotopes are delivered via injection into the prostate.\n\nFor those methods, too, there was too little research to say with confidence which method was superior in preventing deaths from prostate cancer, the researchers said. Retrospective studies, however, found that radiation treatments were associated with increased urinary or bowel problems, compared with no treatment or no initial treatment.\n\nThere was also ""moderate strength evidence"" that a higher external beam radiation was more effective than a lower dose.\n\nTaken together, the review ""does point out that based on current evidence, doctors should not be telling their patients that this form of radiation is better than that form,"" Brooks said. ""Some of the distinctions being made are not really supported by the evidence.""\n\nProton beam therapy in particular is expensive, but according to this report, there isn\'t enough evidence to show it\'s any better than other option.\n\nRadiation, he noted, may be the best option for men whose tumors have spread outside the gland, since simply removing the prostate gland surgically is not likely to be as effective, he said.\n\nThe American Cancer Society estimates that in 2009, approximately 192,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and approximately 27,000 men died of the disease.\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Perhaps because of all of the excitement coming out of the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago, relatively few news organizations picked up on this important paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine.  We applaud HealthDay for doing so.</span>","This 750 word story provided readers with a good synopsis of the study results and did so in plain and straightforward terms providing definitions for the average reader.

Mothers were first asked about their alcohol use when the kids were 9 months old. The children were last given a battery of behavioral and cognitive tests when they were 5 years of age.\n\nWomen were defined as light drinkers if they had no more than one or two drinks a week. A drink was defined as a very small glass of wine, a half pint of beer, or a small single measure of spirits, says study researcher Yvonne Kelly, PhD, of University College London.\n\n""Our results suggest that children born to mothers who drank at low levels were not at any risk of social or emotional difficulties or any risk of emotional impairments compared to mothers who did not drink,"" Kelly tells WebMD.\n\n""But that is a world away from recommending that expectant mothers should drink,"" Kelly is quick to add.\n\nIndeed, many of the women included in the ""light drinkers"" group had no more than a drink or two during their entire pregnancy.\n\nIn the U.K., women are advised not to drink at all during the first trimester of their pregnancy and to drink no more than a drink or two a week after that.\n\nIn the U.S., pregnant women are strongly advised not to drink at all, says Eva Pressman, MD, director of maternal/fetal medicine at the University of Rochester, N.Y.\n\nPressman points out that women who are light drinkers during pregnancy tend to be from households with relatively high incomes. Children in high-income households tend to perform better on behavioral and cognitive tests -- which could mask some possible harms from their mothers\' light drinking during pregnancy.\n\n""What we tell women is that we don\'t know of a safe threshold for drinking alcohol during pregnancy. So our recommendation is not to consume any alcohol at all,"" Pressman tells WebMD.\n\nThe Kelly study appears in the Oct. 5 online issue of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.']","This story declares that researchers found light drinking during pregnancy does no harm. But the researchers made no such finding. Thus, it didn’t match ","This is the weaker of two stories we reviewed on a large study that showed no link between a couple of small alcoholic drinks per week during pregnancy and negative health outcomes. Unlike the Time story reviewed, this one did not adequately analyze the evidence presented or place it into a larger context. The lead sentence overstated the study conclusions by saying the researchers found light drinking does not cause harm, when actually they reported they did not find evidence of harm among the children of light drinkers, The distinction is important. The story does make good use of independent sources.

Similar approaches are also being tried at other centers, including the National Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\n“Our goal is to have a cure, but we can’t say that word,” said Dr. Carl June, who leads the research team at the University of Pennsylvania. He hopes the new treatment will eventually replace bone-marrow transplantation, an even more arduous, risky and expensive procedure that is now the last hope when other treatments fail in leukemia and related diseases.\n\nThree adults with chronic leukemia treated at the University of Pennsylvania have also had complete remissions, with no signs of disease; two of them have been well for more than two years, said Dr. David Porter. Four adults improved but did not have full remissions, and one was treated too recently to evaluate. A child improved and then relapsed. In two adults, the treatment did not work at all. The Pennsylvania researchers were presenting their results on Sunday and Monday in Atlanta at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology.\n\nDespite the mixed results, cancer experts not involved with the research say it has tremendous promise, because even in this early phase of testing it has worked in seemingly hopeless cases. “I think this is a major breakthrough,” said Dr. Ivan Borrello, a cancer expert and associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nDr. John Wagner, the director of pediatric blood and marrow transplantation at the University of Minnesota , called the Pennsylvania results “phenomenal” and said they were “what we’ve all been working and hoping for but not seeing to this extent.”\n\nA major drug company, Novartis , is betting on the Pennsylvania team and has committed $20 million to building a research center on the university’s campus to bring the treatment to market.\n\nHervé Hoppenot, the president of Novartis Oncology, called the research “fantastic” and said it had the potential — if the early results held up — to revolutionize the treatment of leukemia and related blood cancers. Researchers say the same approach, reprogramming the patient’s immune system, may also eventually be used against tumors like breast and prostate cancer .\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo perform the treatment, doctors remove millions of the patient’s T-cells — a type of white blood cell — and insert new genes that enable the T-cells to kill cancer cells. The technique employs a disabled form of H.I.V. because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. The new genes program the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia.\n\nThe altered T-cells — called chimeric antigen receptor cells — are then dripped back into the patient’s veins, and if all goes well they multiply and start destroying the cancer.\n\nThe T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells, whether they are healthy or malignant.\n\nA sign that the treatment is working is that the patient becomes terribly ill, with raging fevers and chills — a reaction that oncologists call “shake and bake,” Dr. June said. Its medical name is cytokine-release syndrome, or cytokine storm, referring to the natural chemicals that pour out of cells in the immune system as they are being activated, causing fevers and other symptoms. The storm can also flood the lungs and cause perilous drops in blood pressure — effects that nearly killed Emma.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She wound up on a ventilator, unconscious and swollen almost beyond recognition, surrounded by friends and family who had come to say goodbye.\n\nBut at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Doctors had never seen such a spike before and thought it might be what was making her so sick.\n\nDr. June knew that a drug could lower IL-6 — his daughter takes it for rheumatoid arthritis . It had never been used for a crisis like Emma’s, but there was little to lose. Her oncologist, Dr. Stephan A. Grupp, ordered the drug. The response, he said, was “amazing.”\n\nWithin hours, Emma began to stabilize. She woke up a week later, on May 2, the day she turned 7; the intensive-care staff sang “Happy Birthday.”\n\nSince then, the research team has used the same drug, tocilizumab, in several other patients.\n\nIn patients with lasting remissions after the treatment, the altered T-cells persist in the bloodstream, though in smaller numbers than when they were fighting the disease. Some patients have had the cells for years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Michel Sadelain, who conducts similar studies at the Sloan-Kettering Institute, said: “These T-cells are living drugs. With a pill, you take it, it’s eliminated from your body and you have to take it again.” But T-cells, he said, “could potentially be given only once, maybe only once or twice or three times.”\n\nThe Pennsylvania researchers said they were surprised to find any big drug company interested in their work, because a new batch of T-cells must be created for each patient — a far cry from the familiar commercial strategy of developing products like Viagra or cholesterol medicines, in which millions of people take the same drug.\n\nBut Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. Such home-run drugs can be approved more quickly and efficiently, he said, with smaller studies than are needed for drugs with less obvious benefits.\n\n“The economic model is totally acceptable,” Mr. Hoppenot said.\n\nBut such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. A prime example is the Novartis drug Gleevec, which won rapid approval in 2001 for use against certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. It can cost more than $5,000 a month, depending on the dosage.\n\nDr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient — far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, “Our costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs.”\n\nThe research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails. One patient had a remission after being treated only twice, and even then the reaction was so delayed that it took the researchers by surprise. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells. The child who had a temporary remission apparently relapsed because not all of her leukemic cells had the marker that was targeted by the altered T-cells.\n\nIt is not clear whether a patient’s body needs the altered T-cells forever. The cells do have a drawback: they destroy healthy B-cells as well as cancerous ones, leaving patients vulnerable to certain types of infections, so Emma and the other patients need regular treatments with immune globulins to prevent illness.\n\nSo far, her parents say, Emma seems to have taken it all in stride. She went back to school this year with her second-grade classmates, and though her grades are high and she reads about 50 books a month, she insists impishly that her favorite subjects are lunch and recess.\n\n“It’s time for her to be a kid again and get her childhood back,” Mr. Whitehead said.""]",This ,"The story was peppered with sensational descriptions (“amazing,” “phenomenal,” “fantastic,” etc. ) that attest to the electrifying possibilities of the new treatment, which involves infusing patients with a virus that will reprogram their immune systems to fight cancer. But there was no independent voice to deliver any sober admonishment about a treatment that’s only been tested on a dozen people.
This story would have been much stronger without the drama and with more cautionary information.  Without longer term follow up, we have no idea what the future holds for these patients.

This news release from the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) encourages people to seek out massage therapists in order to fend off seasonal colds and flu, since regular massages “make the immune system stronger,” the release says. To support this point, the news release cites three studies from 2001, 2004 and 2010 and talks vaguely about the results of each trial. Sweeping, empty language is used, such as “enhanced immune function” and “significant changes,” without further elaboration. Hardly any data is given, including how many people participated in each study, what exactly the trials measured, the extent of the benefits and for how long each trial ran. And how does the AMTA know that these effects were due to the massage therapies themselves and not other factors? It is also unclear what exactly is newsworthy about this topic, since all of the studies took place years ago.
More importantly, the release makes sweeping assumptions between what was actually studied (and in what population) and their recommendations for the general population about “seasonal diseases.” Even without looking at the original studies, this is sloppy and done haphazardly.

Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.'],"This story promises that “better prostate cancer testing” may be right around the corner, even as the researchers and editorial writers warn of limitations and “significant hurdles.”","A test of merging MRI scans of a patient’s prostate with ultrasound-guided biopsies shows that in some cases the probes hit the target more often. But while this story paints a picture of a dramatic step forward, it fails to tell readers that four out of five core samples still came up empty and that the MRI technique failed to find any cancer in many men who were shown to have cancer using the standard biopsy procedure.
The story uses the phrase “watchful waiting” to describe men who have elevated PSA values, but negative biopsies.  The term actually applies to men with diagnosed cancers who are “watched” for signs of cancer progression–and then receive treatment only to relieve symptoms. The comment that a biopsy is the only way to look at “the tumor cells and decide how dangerous the cancer is” is confusing.  For men with an elevated PSA, the biopsy is the only way to determine whether they HAVE cancer.  For men with low-risk cancers who are undergoing active surveillance (such as the subjects in the study), the biopsy is a helpful test (along with PSA) to determine whether the cancer is becoming more dangerous.  The US Preventive Services Task Force advised against routine screening because they concluded that the net benefit (prostate cancer deaths prevented) was outweighed by the harms (overdiagnosis, treatment complications).
We do applaud the story for at least including some important context about fundamental doubts about the overall value of prostate cancer testing and treatment.

Consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction. About 15 million Americans have food allergies, including 1 in 13 children, according to the Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) group.

The same dose worked for nearly 54 percent of kids, 6 to 11.\n\nThe skin patch — intended to desensitize patients to peanuts by exposing them to tiny amounts of the allergen — may be particularly appealing to children who are too frightened to try oral or under-the-tongue therapy.\n\n“Many have been told all their lives that if they ingest peanuts they will have a severe reaction and die,"" he said.

With this you just slap a little patch on their backs.”\n\nAlthough some volunteers experienced redness and itchiness at the site of the patch, there were no serious side effects. Just two dropped out because of flare-ups of eczema.\n\n“The goal for most practicing allergists and for most parents is to get a child to the point where if there is an accidental ingestion of peanut it would not be as risky or life-threatening,” said Dr. Amy Stallings, an assistant professor of pediatrics in the division of allergy and immunology at the Duke University Medical Center who is not affiliated with the new study. “And the patch may be a way of doing this that is safer.”\n\nThe patch study\'s results are promising, although researchers need to continue following the participants for another year, Sampson said. It could be several more years before the patch will be available for consumers.\n\nResearchers are trying to discover why food allergies have increased among children — the number of kids living with peanut or tree nut allergies tripled between 1997 and 2008, studies show — but there’s no clear answer. Allergies to peanuts and tree nuts tend to begin in childhood and are usually lifelong.']","A “peanut patch” eliminates allergic reactions to small amounts of peanut protein in about half of the participants in an experimental study presented at a conference. While the overall story is solid, we think it’s important to notify readers of the limited peer review that such conference presentations receive.

In addition, there was no information on potential costs, and the headline and lede may (emphasis on the “may”) lead a reader to expect a more dramatic outcome than is actually the case.

What is known now is that depression affects not just the brain but the whole organism,”said Natalie Rasgon, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.\n\nBut a new study of which Rasgon is a senior author finds evidence of a possible biomarker for major depressive disorder, which could lead to better treatments for this sometimes crippling disease.\n\nThe study by a group of researchers from around the U.S. and in Sweden finds that a specific, naturally-occurring chemical, called acetyl-L-carnitine, or LAC, is lower in the blood of people suffering from depression. The research was published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“Previous animal studies convincingly showed the role of LAC in models of depression. This study is the first confirmation of the results from animal studies in human subjects with depression,” Rasgon told ABC News.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nLevels of the chemical were lower among people with more severe depression\n\nResearchers measured LAC levels in the blood of 116 participants, and found that those with depression had significantly lower levels of the chemical than healthy individuals. Two groups of people at two different hospitals were examined, with the same results.\n\nLAC levels were especially low among people whose depression was more severe, who began suffering from the disease at an earlier age or who had a history of childhood trauma. Levels were lowest among females whose depression did not get better with medications or therapy, known as “treatment-resistant depression,” and who had suffered childhood trauma or neglect.\n\nThe human body naturally produces LAC from a nutrient called carnitine, but researchers found that carnitine levels were the same in people with and without depression. This suggests that differing levels of LAC can be attributed to depression and not to diet.\n\nWhat do we know about this chemical?\n\nLAC performs a number of important tasks, including regulating how the brain and nervous system use energy. It also can interact with DNA to change how certain genes are expressed.\n\nIn previous studies, LAC has been shown to effectively and rapidly improve symptoms of depression in mice.\n\nA review of multiple studies published in the Journal of Psychosomatic Medicine in 2017 showed that acetyl-L-carnitine may be better than a placebo in treating depression and may be as effective as common antidepressants but with fewer side effects. The review authors noted the studies were very small and larger trials are necessary to confirm any benefit.\n\nThere is a LAC supplement that has been used for dementia, but a 2003 review from Cochrane found it is unlikely to be of benefit for this purpose. Some studies suggest a benefit for a type of nerve pain called neuropathy.\n\nBut it is important to note this study did not test if LAC can be used for the treatment of depression.\n\n“We are at the very beginning of this discovery and can’t recommend people to buy this supplement at the GNC store,” warned Rasgon.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nHow further research might lead to possible treatments\n\nLAC has potential to be a biomarker, something measurable in the body that reflects the presence of a disease. As such, it could potentially be used to screen for and diagnose severe or treatment-resistant depression and allow for earlier and more aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers hope future studies could shed light on whether physical activity, dietary habits, and sleep may affect LAC levels.\n\nThis study also found that people on antidepressant drugs still had lower levels of LAC in their blood, suggesting that taking supplements of the chemical might be helpful or possibly even necessary to fully benefit from a medication.\n\nThis research, together with prior studies, suggests that correcting a deficiency in LAC could be a step toward more targeted treatments of depression, especially for those who suffered childhood trauma or began having depression at an early age.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\n“We are excited with these results and are working on extending them to further understand the role of LAC in patients receiving treatment for depression,”Rasgon said. “It is one of the pieces of a very large puzzle that constitutes depressive disorders as an illness.”\n\nWhile this study has important implications in understanding depression, Rasgon cautioned that it requires larger studies to confirm the findings. “There are many questions to be answered – who will ultimately benefit from taking this supplement, what is the right dose, what is the appropriate duration of use.”\n\nThe study was a collaboration between researchers at Stanford, Rockefeller University, Duke University, Weill Cornell Medical College, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.\n\nMichael MacIntyre is a psychiatry resident working with the ABC News Medical Unit.']","However, parts of the story might confuse readers by suggesting a benefit to taking LAC for depression even though, as the story points out, there’s as yet no evidence that LAC can effectively treat depression.","This story reported a study that showed an amino acid called acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC) is lower in people with clinical depression, suggesting it might be used as a biomarker to guide treatment decisions.
We applaud the story’s generally cautious tone and detailed description of the study. However, parts of the story might confuse readers by suggesting a benefit to taking LAC for depression even though, as the story points out, there’s as yet no evidence that LAC can effectively treat depression.
Also, the story could have broadened its perspective by including comments from independent sources and data on societal costs of depression versus the potential cost of biomarker testing and treatment with LAC.

During the study period, 865 pregnant women were hospitalized with flu. Sixty-three of these patients, or about 7 percent, had severe illness.\n\nAfter adjusting for underlying medical conditions, vaccination status, and pregnancy trimester, the researchers found that early treatment with the antiviral drug oseltamivir was associated with a shorter hospital stay. Among pregnant women with severe flu illness who were treated early -- within two days of the start of symptoms -- the median length of stay was about five days shorter compared to hospitalized pregnant women with severe flu illness who were treated later (2.2 days vs. 7.8 days). Pregnant women hospitalized with less severe illness who were treated early also had a shorter hospital stay than those treated later, but the difference was not as great.\n\nIn the study, pregnant women hospitalized with severe flu illness were half as likely to have been vaccinated as women hospitalized with milder illness (14 percent vs. 26 percent).

So in theory, treating them early on might help stave off some the more than 1.2 million heart attacks — a third of them fatal — that occur every year in the U.S.\n\nYet there’s no evidence that treating people based on heart scan results does any good, said Dr. John McEvoy, of Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease in Baltimore, who led the new study.\n\nBy contrast, it’s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the images cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.\n\n“Testing might lead to more harm than good,” McEvoy told Reuters Health, adding that heart scans may cost $600 or more.\n\nHis team looked at 1,000 Korean patients who chose to get a heart scan as part of a health screening program at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.\n\nThe researchers compared those patients to closely matched individuals who opted to forgo the scans — not currently recommended by guidelines — and just get the standard health checkup.\n\nMore than a fifth of the patients who got scanned had cholesterol buildups in their arteries, also called atherosclerosis.\n\nThree months later, these individuals were using cholesterol-lowering statins 34 percent of the time and blood-thinning aspirin 40 percent of the time. In those who tested negative for atherosclerosis or didn’t get scanned, less than 10 percent used the medications.\n\nPeople who got scans also had more additional tests and major heart procedures.\n\nThe researchers expected that if the extra drugs and procedures were actually helpful, the treated people would have a lower rate of serious heart problems in the future.\n\nBut after another 18 months, there was no such difference. There was just one event in the 1,000 people who had CCTA (one case of hospitalization for chest pain) and one in the 1,000 people who didn’t (a heart-related death).\n\nCurrently, whether a patient gets statin or aspirin is based on risk factors such as their age, and how much cholesterol is in their blood. Both drugs have side effects, notably joint problems and bleeding ulcers.\n\nAlthough the study can’t prove that getting a scan caused the extra medication use, the gap could not be explained by differences in risk factors for heart disease, such as cholesterol levels or smoking.\n\nIn an editorial, Dr. Michael S. Lauer of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the new study serves as a reminder of the downsides of screening.\n\n“Physicians cannot easily ignore diagnoses made with screening tests because it is impossible for them to determine whether their patients have real disease or pseudodisease,” Lauer notes. “Therefore, physicians prescribe tests, medications, procedures, or even surgical procedures, all of which carry inherent risks.”\n\nMcEvoy agrees. “With these new imaging techniques, we are left with the dilemma of what to do with the results,” he said.\n\nEven when screening helps predict health problems down the road, Lauer adds, that doesn’t mean treatments are necessarily beneficial.\n\n“Overdiagnosis is threatening to become an increasingly important public health problem because of the enthusiasm for and proliferation of unproven screening tests,” Lauer writes.\n\nMcEvoy said there have been several reports of doctors doing CCTA heart scans in healthy patients, although the practice is currently discouraged by the American Heart Association.\n\nAccording to McEvoy, doctors should focus on patients’ lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/lEEptL and bit.ly/kBzX6J Archives of Internal Medicine, online May 23, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">While both this story and a competing <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3962"" target=""_blank"">Wall Street Journal story</a> scored well, Reuters delivered context and significance more clearly and powerfully. </span>","This story summarized the study and its significance clearly in the first sentence – “When symptom-free people have heart scans to look for clogged arteries, they can end up with overtreatment and side effects.”

Among the most dispensed: eat a healthy diet, keep a healthy weight, avoid alcohol and tobacco and stay away from certain medications, such as blood pressure and depression drugs.\n\nNow, researchers publishing in the journal Reproduction have found that another lifestyle change—exercise—may also help improve sperm quality.\n\nIn the study, Behzad Maleki at Justus-Liebig University in Germany and his colleagues recruited 280 sedentary, middle-aged men and randomly assigned them to one of three exercise regimens, or to no exercise, and followed them for six months. They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.\n\nCompared to the control group that didn’t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm. After six months, they showed less DNA damage, healthier sperm shape and lower levels of metabolic stress factors. They also showed higher numbers of sperm precursors.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips.

While it’s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that’s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.\n\nGet The Brief.

44,story_reviews_00669,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/should-pregnant-women-eat-more-tuna/,2015-03-02 05:00:00,Should Pregnant Women Eat More Tuna?,"['Photo\n\nFor years pregnant women have been warned about eating tuna because of concerns about mercury exposure. But a federal panel has reignited the debate about the benefits and risks of eating tuna and other seafood during pregnancy.\n\nExperts agree that seafood is a rich source of important nutrients, and that most of us don’t eat enough of it. Fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, iodine, selenium and vitamin D. And numerous studies show that the nutrients in fish are particularly important for brain development in fetuses and nursing infants.\n\nAs part of a sweeping review of nutrition recommendations, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recently reiterated the current seafood guidelines: Americans should eat a wide variety of seafood. The report also acknowledges the risk of mercury exposure from certain kinds of seafoods, and notes that women who are pregnant, nursing or may become pregnant should avoid certain kinds — tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel — because of their high mercury content.\n\nThe panel withheld a recommendation about tuna, second only to shrimp in popularity in the United States. Current guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency warn pregnant and nursing women to limit tuna consumption to six ounces per week.\n\nThe advisory committee has recommended that these agencies “re-evaluate” their stance on tuna for pregnant women. In the report, the panel argues that albacore tuna is a “special case.” They noted that even when women ate double the recommended weekly amount of tuna, the benefits far outweighed the risks. “All evidence was in favor of net benefits for infant development and (cardiovascular disease) risk reduction,” the panel wrote.\n\nThe suggestion that pregnant women can eat more white albacore tuna — the type of tuna typically used in canned tuna — has upset advocacy groups that have called for increased warnings about mercury on tuna packaging.\n\n“Tuna is responsible for nearly seven times more mercury exposure than the four high-mercury fish that the Federal Food and Drug Administration advises pregnant women not to eat,” said Michael Bender, director of the mercury policy project, in a statement. “So why would the proposed 2015 dietary guidelines recommend that pregnant women eat more of it?”\n\nBut Dr. Steve Abrams, a panel member involved in the seafood recommendations and medical director of the Neonatal Nutrition Program at Baylor College of Medicine, said that while women need to be aware of the types of fish they are eating, the evidence is strong that fish consumption by mothers is good for the brains of their babies.\n\n“The goal of the dietary guidelines is to give people a healthy way to eat and not to include or exclude certain foods,” said Dr. Abrams. “The benefit of having (omega-3 fatty acids) in your diet really exceeds the likely risk of contamination. The point is that you should have a variety of types of seafood and not limit yourself to one type, and variety includes canned tuna.”\n\nAlice Lichtenstein, senior scientist and director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at Tufts University said the panel hasn’t suggested that pregnant women eat more tuna. “The issue of fish contamination is a moving target and you need very current data,” said Dr. Lichtenstein. “It may be that the issue is re-evaluated and there is no change.”\n\nMercury levels in our oceans are on the rise due to an increase in industrial mercury emissions. Plants, plankton and tiny fish that have absorbed small amounts of mercury are eaten by larger fish. Over time, large fish sharks and swordfish accumulate high levels of mercury. As a result, health officials recommend fish like sardines, salmon, tilapia and trout that are lower on the food chain and have accumulated less mercury in their tissue.\n\nThe benefits of fish consumption on a developing fetus are clear. In a Harvard study of 135 mothers and infants, researchers tracked fish consumption during pregnancy and tested the mother’s hair to measure her mercury exposure. They found that for each weekly serving of fish the mother ate while pregnant, her baby’s score on visual recognition memory tests increased an average of four points. At the same time, a baby’s score dropped by 7.5 points for every one part per million increase in mercury found in the mother’s hair sample. The babies who scored highest on the memory tests were those whose mothers had consumed two or more servings of fish each week during their pregnancy, but were tested to have very low mercury levels.\n\nHealth officials have long worried about balancing warnings about mercury against the obvious benefits of consuming more fish. Currently fewer than one in five Americans eats the recommended two servings a week of fish. About one-third eat one serving of seafood weekly and nearly half of us eats very little seafood or none at all.\n\nThis fall Consumer Reports issued a lengthy paper on fish and mercury exposure, noting the special concerns about canned tuna due to its popularity. Six ounces of canned tuna contains 60 micrograms of mercury compared to just 4 micrograms of mercury in a six-ounce serving of salmon, according to Consumer Reports. (A six-ounce serving of swordfish contains 170 micrograms, the magazine said. )\n\nFor people who want to safely eat more seafood, the magazine recommended shrimp, scallops, sardines, salmon, oysters, squid and tilapia as the lowest-mercury seafood.

The debate has come back to the fore after the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee submitted its scientific report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture last month.

This is a well-rounded “explainer” story looking at female condoms, a less frequently used form of contraception compared to male condoms. The story is not directly tied to a specific research study, but does include numbers for efficacy which are nearly equal to those for male condoms.
The story comes with a sizable dose of speculation about potential benefits (such as decreased risk of infection and increased sexual pleasure) that are unproven.  On the other hand, it offers refreshing candor about the availability of the device and how it is used. We were especially pleased to see so much attention given to cost and availability of the product. It also openly disclosed one of the source’s relationships with the condom’s manufacturer.

They cause most cases of croup and can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis — an inflammation of the small air passages in the lungs.\n\nThere is no treatment or vaccine for parainfluenza.\n\nFludase is already in phase 2 clinical trials for use against influenza. Adding parainfluenza to its approved indications would provide a unique and potentially large market for San Diego-based NexBio.\n\nParainfluenza uses the same receptors — molecular doorways — to infect cells as flu does.

Studies so far have come to conflicting conclusions as to whether vitamin E or other antioxidants may influence older adults’ risk of dementia.\n\nHowever, the new study followed participants for a longer period than most previous studies on antioxidants and dementia. And it supports findings from some previous research that dietary vitamin E, in particular, might be related to a lower risk of dementia.\n\nResearchers have been interested in whether antioxidants like vitamins E and C and beta-carotene might help stave off dementia because, in theory, their actions might interfere with the process of brain-cell degeneration.\n\nAntioxidants neutralize unstable forms of oxygen called reactive oxygen species that can damage cells throughout the body. Reactive oxygen species are produced naturally in the body, as byproducts of metabolism; because the brain is an area of high metabolic activity, it is thought to be particularly vulnerable to accumulating oxidative damage over a lifetime.\n\nHowever, studies so far have come to mixed conclusions as to whether older adults with a high dietary intake of various antioxidants have a lower risk of dementia. And clinical trials looking at the effects of antioxidant supplements have found no evidence that they cut Alzheimer’s risk.\n\nFor the new study, researchers led by Dr. Monique Breteler, of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, used data from 5,395 adults age 55 and older who were dementia-free at the start of the study. At that point, they were interviewed about their usual diet habits, which the researchers used to estimate their intake of vitamins C and E and beta-carotene.\n\nOver the next decade, 465 study participants were diagnosed with dementia, including 365 with Alzheimer’s.\n\nAmong the one-third of men and women with the highest vitamin E intakes from food, 120 developed dementia. Of the third with the lowest intakes, 164 were diagnosed with dementia.\n\nWhen Breteler’s team considered a number of other factors — including participants’ age, education, weight, and smoking and drinking habits — high vitamin E intake was linked to a one-quarter reduction in dementia risk.\n\nThe one-third of study participants with the highest vitamin E consumption typically got 18.5 milligrams (mg) per day, just over the recommended daily intake of 15 mg.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that they cannot exclude the possibility that factors other than vitamin E explain the connection. Nor is it clear why vitamin E, but not vitamin C or beta-carotene, was linked to a lower dementia risk.\n\nBut the finding is in line with a previous study of U.S. adults that found that a higher intake of vitamin E, but not vitamin C or beta-carotene, was related to a lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s over two years.\n\nAccording to Breteler’s team, studies should continue to look at the relationship between antioxidant intake and dementia — including whether antioxidant consumption at different points in life might have different effects on dementia risk.\n\nFood sources of vitamin E include wheat germ, nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts, vegetable oils such as sunflower and safflower oils, and some green vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli.\n\nIn the current study, participants’ primary vitamin E sources included vegetable oils, margarine and butter.\n\nIt is unlikely that people could get too much vitamin E from food. However, high doses of vitamin E from supplements carry a risk of bleeding. Experts advise that adults consume no more than 1,000 mg of vitamin E per day.\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/xud27m Archives of Neurology, July 2010.']","A refreshingly restrained take on a new observational study of vitamin E and the risk of dementia. The story maintained a cautious tone throughout and never slipped into the ""may reduce risk"" language so prevalent in other reports of observational studies."," While the story has a few notable deficiencies — no independent comment and insufficient statistical detail regarding the magnitude of the effect — readers will undoubtedly come away with the right bottom line message about this study: Interesting, but inconclusive.

One group consumed a 250-milliliter (ml) glass of beetroot juice, and the other group had the same, except their beetroot juice was nitrate-free.\n\nThe nitrate-free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group.\n\nAll groups consumed the juice daily for 4 weeks. They were also monitored for 2 weeks before and after the study, bringing the total trial period to 8 weeks.\n\nThe trial was double-blind, which means neither the administering clinicians nor the patients knew whether the beetroot juice they were given was the placebo or the active supplement.\n\nDuring the 4 weeks in which they were taking the juice, patients in the active supplement group, whose beetroot juice contained inorganic nitrate, experienced a reduction in blood pressure of 8/4 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).\n\nThe first figure is systolic pressure, generated when the heart is pumping, and the second figure is diastolic pressure, created when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The 8/4-mmHg reduction brought the blood pressure of many participants back into the normal range.\n\nIn the 2 weeks after they stopped drinking the juice, their blood pressure returned to the higher levels noted at the start of the study.\n\nThis is the first study that shows evidence of dietary nitrate supplementation\'s long-lasting benefit in a group of patients with high blood pressure.\n\nShare on Pinterest High blood pressure is a common health issue in the U.S., and beetroot juice acts as a natural aid.\n\nThe patients in the active supplement group also experienced a 20 percent or so improvement in blood vessel dilation capacity, and their artery stiffness reduced by around 10 percent.\n\nStudies show that these changes are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.\n\nThere were no changes in blood pressure, blood vessel function, or artery stiffness in the placebo group.\n\nThe authors note that the reduction achieved in the active supplement group is close to that achieved by medication.

Treatment of unstable fractures is either surgical or nonsurgical (using externally applied casts). Neither method yields an entirely satisfactory outcome in older adults. Traditional casting techniques are associated with poor fracture alignment and healing, as well as plaster-related sores. Surgery is often complicated by poor implant fixation (bone healing), wound problems, and infection. A modified casting technique has been developed, close contact casting, which uses minimal padding compared with traditional casting and achieves fracture reduction by distributing contact pressure by close anatomic fit.\n\nKeith Willett, M.B.B.S., F.R.C.S., of the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, and colleagues randomly assigned 620 adults older than 60 years with acute, unstable ankle fracture to surgery (n = 309) or casting (n = 311). Casts were applied in the operating room under general or spinal anesthesia by a trained surgeon.\n\nAmong the 620 adults (average age, 71 years; 74 percent women) who were randomized, 96 percent completed the study. Nearly all participants (93 percent) received assigned treatment; 52 of 275 (19 percent) who initially received casting later converted to surgery. At 6 months, casting resulted in measures of ankle function equivalent to that with surgery. Infection and wound breakdown were more common with surgery (10 percent vs 1 percent), as were additional operating room procedures (6 percent vs 1 percent).\n\nRadiologic malunion (abnormal healing of a fracture) was more common in the casting group (15 percent vs 3 percent for surgery). Casting required less operating room time compared with surgery. There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes: quality of life, pain, ankle motion, mobility, and patient satisfaction.\n\n""Close contact casting was delivered successfully for most participants, substantially reducing the number of patients requiring invasive surgical procedures at the outset and additional operations during a 6-month period,"" the authors write.\n\nThe researchers add that close contact casting may be an appropriate treatment for older adults with unstable ankle fracture.\n\n(doi:10.1001/jama.2016.14719; the study is available pre-embargo to the media at the For the Media website)\n\nEditor\'s Note: Please see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures, funding and support, etc.\n\nEditorial: Close Contact Casting vs Surgery for Unstable Ankle Fractures\n\n""The results reported by Willett et al demonstrate that most unstable ankle fractures in older patients can be treated with a cast without the need for surgery,"" writes David W. Sanders, M.D., M.Sc., F.R.C.S.C., of Western University, London, Ontario, Canada, in an accompanying editorial.\n\n""However, many patients who were initially treated by casting subsequently required repeat casting or surgery. Further studies are needed to help identify which patients will not benefit from casting. Although close contact casting may be unfamiliar to some orthopedic surgeons, it can avoid surgery for older patients with ankle fractures, yet result in equivalent functional outcomes. This technique is worth considering when treating this challenging clinical problem.""\n\n(doi:10.1001/jama.2016.14819; the study is available pre-embargo to the media at the For the Media website)\n\nEditor\'s Note: The author has completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest and none were reported.\n\n###']","A nod to cost, funders and more details on the availability of this modified technique would have made this release stronger.","This news release reports on the results of a randomized trial of older adults (average age 71) who had ankle fractures that were either treated with “close contact casting” or with surgery. While the outcomes after six months were similar in both groups the close contact casting was superior in terms of reduced infections and additional operating room procedures as well as being a lot safer. Yet many patients who received casting as an an initial treatment subsequently required repeat casting or surgery.
The release covers most of the bases and reported fairly on the essentials of the study, while not exaggerating either the benefits or risks of the surgical option. Readers might benefit from a definition of a ‘stable’ versus an ‘unstable’ ankle fracture and of “radiologic malunion.”  The term sounds threatening but does not necessarily result in pain or functional impairment.

The more damage there is to the heart, the more troponin there will be in the blood. Existing tests measure troponin T or troponin I. The new study looked at a highly sensitive type of troponin I test that may be more accurate in less time. The findings appear in the Dec. 28 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nResearchers led by Dr. Till Keller at the University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany, compared the new highly sensitive troponin I test with the current test and other blood markers for heart attack among 1,818 people who showed symptoms of a possible heart attack. Of these, 413 were deemed to be having a heart attack. The troponin tests were more predictive than other biomarkers used to make the diagnosis, the study showed.\n\nThe new test was more sensitive than the existing one. This means that if a test result is negative, the person is not having a heart attack. Another measure, specificity, rules in disease with a high degree of confidence. The issue with available troponin testing has been that they must be repeated two more times over the next 12 to 16 hours for accurate readings. The new test yields sensitive results in three hours.\n\nThe study was partially funded by Brahms AG and Abbott Diagnostics. Abbott Diagnostics developed both the new and the conventional troponin tests used in the study.\n\n""We can rule out heart attacks more quickly with the new test,"" said Dr. Sandra Chaparro, a cardiologist at the University of Miami Hospital in Florida. ""If the patient presents to an emergency room less than three hours after chest pain, we can make a diagnosis of a heart attack.""\n\nMany people come to the emergency room with chest pain. Typically, the doctor orders an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check for problems with the electrical activity of the heart, along with blood work. Not all EKG readings are abnormal during a heart attack, Chaparro explained. This is where the blood test would be used.\n\n""It is very common to have people going to the hospital with chest pain and it could be something important or something not significant,"" she said.

""They had larger brain cells in areas of the brain responsible for memory and learning. And the reason that\'s important is that these brain areas are at high risk for Alzheimer\'s disease.""\n\nIn those people with larger brain volume, ""the risk for Alzheimer\'s and mild cognitive impairment went down by fivefold within five years following the brain scans we conducted,"" he said.\n\nRaji said he was ""amazed"" that this effect was seen with eating fish as little as one to four times a week. ""We\'re talking about just a half serving a day,"" he said. ""And that would be a very small lifestyle change that can affect disease risk a long time down the line.""\n\nRaji and his colleagues are slated to discuss their findings Wednesday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, in Chicago.\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\'s disease, an incurable, age-related disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking and language skills. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment have less severe memory loss than those with Alzheimer\'s but often go on to develop the disease.\n\nTo assess the impact of fish on cognitive health, the authors focused on 260 mentally healthy elderly individuals drawn from the Cardiovascular Health Study, sponsored by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\nAll the participants underwent 3-D MRIs, so the researchers could map out the size of each individual\'s gray matter and track it over 10 years. They also completed the U.S. National Cancer Institute Food Frequency Questionnaire.\n\nThe team then stacked up gray matter changes against dietary consumption as reported in the questionnaire.\n\nThe questionnaires revealed that 163 of the study participants ate fish at least once a week, with most consuming fish between one and four times a week.\n\nWith that information, the authors found that regardless of age, gender, physical activity routines, and/or educational achievement, race or weight, those who ate baked or broiled fish had larger mass in the hippocampus, precuneus, posterior cingulate and orbital frontal cortex regions of their brains.\n\nThe team further observed that people who ate baked or broiled fish weekly displayed better so-called ""working memory,"" enabling them to more effectively execute routine tasks.\n\nBut fish and chips lovers, take note: No cranial benefit was evident with respect to consumption of fried fish.\n\nThe team cautioned that while eating baked and broiled fish appears to exert some cognitive benefit, other lifestyle and socioeconomic factors may play a role. For now, the connection must be viewed as an association, rather than a cause-and-effect.\n\nDr. Richard Lipton, vice chair of neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, reiterated the point.\n\n""One has to wonder if there are other factors associated with fish consumption that they didn\'t measure that might be protective,"" he said. ""Like maybe people who eat fish exercise more, or eat less total calories. Or they could be eating other components of a Mediterranean Diet, such as fruits and vegetables.""\n\nLipton added that ""this group of researchers is really, really good,"" and called the study results ""a very interesting finding, and absolutely worthy of further exploration.""\n\nResearch presented at scientific meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on brain health, visit the Society for Neuroscience.']",Another confusing story about an observational study that fails to explicitly state and explain to readers the limitations of observational studies.,"Readers heads must be spinning worse than Linda Blair’s in “The Exorcist” when they read – in one story – that this “must be viewed as an association, rather than a cause-and-effect” – yet they get cause-and-effect language such as:

Although HIV and the newly identified virus group are different, they are both retroviruses.\n\nThe report, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was accompanied by a call for new clinical trials to test HIV drugs in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nDoctors don\'t know what causes chronic fatigue syndrome, characterized by debilitating fatigue and chronic pain with symptoms that can wax and wane over time. Some patients say friends, co-workers and even family members don\'t believe they are really sick.\n\nStudies finding a viral connection with the disease would completely transform how the illness is treated and viewed. The findings also offer a potential path for treatment, possibly with drugs that are already FDA-approved for another condition.\n\nBased on other recent research linking the syndrome to a retrovirus called XMRV, some doctors are already prescribing drugs approved for HIV for fatigue patients. The syndrome has no effective treatments yet.\n\nThe group of viruses identified in fatigue patients, called murine leukemia virus-related viruses, or MLV, are known to cause cancer and neurological problems in mice, but whether they cause disease in humans isn\'t known. XMRV is among several different members of the MLV family, researchers said.\n\nIn the new study, researchers said they found at least one of four different MLV-like viruses in 32 of 37, or 86.5%, of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, compared with just three of 44, or 6.8%, of apparently healthy blood donors.\n\nMonday\'s paper is the latest in a series of reports about a possible link between CFS and a virus. Interest in viruses has been intense since an October report in the journal Science found XMRV in a majority of fatigue patients.\n\nSubsequent studies have focused on XMRV and found conflicting evidence. Indeed, the just-published study was held back from publication in June because it was at odds with a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found no evidence of XMRV in chronic-fatigue-syndrome patients.\n\nRelated Slideshow <<\n\nThe current paper didn\'t find XMRV, either—one reason it isn\'t likely to resolve a brewing debate over the role XMRV may play in the syndrome.\n\nBut researchers said the variants of MLV-like viruses closely related to XMRV that they found in fatigue patients was evidence of a link between the virus family and the syndrome.\n\nAndrew Mason, a University of Alberta professor, co-wrote the commentary in the journal calling for trials testing anti-retrovirals in CFS patients who are positive for one of the MLV-related viruses. ""If the patients improve, after a certain point you stop debating whether it causes the disease and say, the treatment works and we\'re going to use it,\'\' said Dr. Mason.\n\nBut until scientists develop further evidence establishing that the virus causes the syndrome, a large-scale clinical trial testing HIV drugs against the ailment isn\'t likely. Norbert Bischofberger, chief scientific officer at Gilead Sciences Inc., GILD -1.36% the leading maker of HIV drugs, said the company might consider a small pilot trial but would like to see stronger evidence that the viruses cause CFS before launching a large trial. Still, ""I\'m very open, and this would be a great opportunity,\'\' he said.\n\nA spokesman for Merck MRK -0.59% & Co., another major manufacturer of HIV drugs, said: ""A clinical trial program would be possible to develop only after further substantial evidence of an association with CFS.\'\'\n\nSome doctors and patients are already testing the idea, based in part on a University of Utah and Emory University study in cells. The compounds were tested singly and then in combinations of two at a time, and suggested that three anti-retroviral drugs appeared to inhibit infection by XMRV.\n\nJamie Deckoff-Jones, 56 years old, a doctor and CFS patient in New Mexico, has been blogging about her experiences and those of her 20-year-old daughter. Both tested positive for XMRV and are taking a combination of three anti-retrovirals.\n\nDr. Deckoff-Jones said a year ago she could only get up for short periods during the day. After five months on the drugs, she flew last week to Reno for an XMRV conference. Her daughter was able to go to a party and is enrolling in community college. ""This is all very new, and there is no way to know if improvement will continue,\'\' Dr. Deckoff-Jones wrote in an email, ""but we appear to be on an uphill course.\'\'\n\nAfter the latest paper was held, the researchers took additional steps to demonstrate that the finding was related to a retrovirus and not lab contamination. Eight of the fatigue patients in the study who tested positive for an MLV-related virus using blood frozen 15 years ago were asked to come back to give fresh blood. Seven of the eight remained positive, and the virus had changed slightly over time, a characteristic of a retrovirus.\n\nMany questions remain on why different groups are coming up with different results. It is still unclear why the Centers for Disease Control didn\'t find XMRV or MLV-related viruses in its own study of fatigue patients. At a press briefing Monday, Steve Monroe, director of CDC\'s division of high-consequence pathogens and pathology, said that CDC was able to find MLV-related viruses in a small number of prostate cancer patients, data that isn\'t yet published.\n\nAnthony L. Komaroff of Harvard Medical School, an author of the latest study, said one explanation may be that the patients used in the new study were chosen because they were very sick. Patients in other studies ""are a very different group of people than the ones that knock on my door,\'\' he said.\n\nMeantime, the finding that a small fraction of healthy blood donors may be harboring MLV-like virus raises new worries, researchers said. If confirmed and shown to reflect the presence of the virus in the broader population, it could mean that tens of millions of people in the U.S. and more world-wide are infected.\n\nThe implications aren\'t clear. Research has also linked XMRV to prostate cancer. People diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome are already barred from donating blood in Canada, Australia and New Zealand out of fear a virus may be passed on through transfusions.\n\nAABB, a Bethesda, Md., organization whose members collect most blood donated in the U.S., advises that Americans with fatigue syndrome not donate blood until more data are available. A federally led working group is trying to determine how many blood donors may be infected.\n\nWrite to Amy Dockser Marcus at amy.marcus@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story didn’t address many of our criteria, and two that got satisfactory scores were toss-ups.  We found admirable elements in other stories, evidence that it can be (and was) done better. </span>","But we know the Wall Street Journal is up to the task better than was demonstrated in this piece.  Be sure you read our ""Why This Matters"" comments below.

The third in a series of studies from the Andersen lab involving PD and low-dose lithium, the results add to mounting evidence that low-doses of the psychotropic drug could benefit patients suffering from the incurable, degenerative condition.\n\nThis study, published online in Brain Research, involved Parkinsonian mice that were given Carbidopa/Levodopa (sold as Sinemet®), a drug used to boost levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is lost in PD. While the medication remains the single most effective agent in the management of PD symptoms, long-term use causes its own side effects, among them abnormal involuntary movements or AIMS. Buck professor and senior scientist Julie Andersen, PhD, says AIMS become problematic for 30 percent of patients after four to six years of treatment with Sinemet, with 90 percent of patients suffering from the complication after nine years of chronic use. ""For patients these side effects are just as devastating as the freezing that is associated with PD."" ""In our mice we saw significant behavioral improvement.""\n\nIn this study, Andersen and her team dosed the mice with an amount of lithium equivalent to about a quarter of what humans receive for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Researchers found that lithium boosted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which increases dopamine synthesis via the inhibition of calpain-1, an enzyme that normally reduces dopamine synthesis.\n\nIn earlier studies, Andersen\'s team found that low-dose lithium was protective in two different mouse models of PD. Treatment in mice with a human mutation for PD began when the animals reached late middle-age, the human equivalent of about 60, which is the average age of onset of Parkinson\'s in humans. ""We clearly saw a prevention of the motor difficulties we would expect to see in the animals,"" said Andersen. ""The treatment also protected the area of the brain that is normally damaged by Parkinson\'s.""\n\nPlans for a clinical trial of low-dose lithium for PD patients are in early stages. ""This study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD,"" said David K. Simon, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Simon chairs the Scientific Review Committee for the Parkinson\'s Study Group, a not-for-profit network of Parkinson\'s Centers. ""One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone). However, this study provides additional evidence on top of prior work from Dr. Andersen\'s lab and others that lithium may have therapeutic potential in PD, which is a hypothesis that should be tested in clinical trials,"" he said.\n\nLithium is a naturally occurring element, not a \'developed\' molecule like most medications. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 1970 and has shown to be effective for treating mood disorders and suicidal thoughts. Previous studies suggest that at low doses lithium has a protective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer\'s and Huntington\'s.\n\n###\n\nCitation: The combination of lithium and L-Dopa/Carbidopa reduces MPTP-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) via calpain-1 inhibition in a mouse model: relevance for Parkinson\'s disease therapy.\n\nThis work was supported by grants from National Institutes of Health 5P20GM103653-02; RL!

But clarification comes quickly and with additional useful details.,"We appreciate that there is a need to get a reader’s attention with the title of any document, including news releases. This headline grabs readers with the suggestion that lithium “reduces side effects of most common treatment for Parkinson’s disease,” a statement that’s simply not supported as no humans with Parkinson’s disease were studied. Treating mice with an induced form of the disease is not the same as treating actual people with Parkinson’s disease. Having said that, the release recovers quickly — in the very first sentence — to clarify that the research was done in mice, which is commendable. The release also includes some useful caveats regarding the quality of evidence and what additional research needs to be done before lithium can be considered a viable option in humans. A bit more information about the actual research findings and potential harms of lithium would have been helpful.

The latest investigation from the US team pinpoints which cells are important and how they might work.\n\nIn the first of a series of experiments in mice, Cai showed that neural stem cells, which are found in a handful of brain regions at birth, disappear from the hypothalamus over time. The stem cells are known to form fresh brain cells in youth, but the process slows down dramatically in adults. Though small, the hypothalamus forms a crucial connection between the body’s nervous and hormonal systems.\n\nTo test whether the decline in stem cells was causing ageing, and not itself a result of old age, the researchers injected mice with a toxin that wiped out 70% of their neural stem cells. The effect was striking. Over the next few months the mice aged more rapidly than usual, and performed much worse than control animals on a battery of tests of endurance, coordination, social behaviour and ability to recognise objects. “Behaviourally mice aged faster when these cells were removed during early ageing,” Cai told the Guardian. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals.\n\nNext, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. This time the mice lived longer than controls, typically several months more, an increase of about 15%. If a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.\n\nMaximum human lifespan could far exceed 115 years – new research Read more\n\nHaving proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. They found that molecules called microRNAs, or miRNAs, that are released from neural stem cells were responsible for most of the ageing effects. When the molecules are produced in the hypothalamus, they flow into the clear fluid in the brain and spinal cord and affect how genes operate.\n\n“The mechanism is partially due to these cells secreting certain miRNAs which help maintain youth, and the loss of these leads to ageing” said Cai, whose study is published in Nature. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.\n\n“It is a tour de force,” said David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School. “It’s a breakthrough. The brain controls how long we live. I can see a day when we are implanted with stem cells or treated with stem cell RNAs that improve our health and extend our lives. I would love to know which brain stem cell secretions extend a mouse’s lifespan and if human stem cells make them too.”""]",The bottom line is: We are talking about approximately 20 male mice.,"This story describes some interesting but very early research into the mechanisms of aging and how they might be altered.
The story made it clear that this was mouse-level research and has several hurdles to go before it’s ever tested in people. One weak point for the story was how the story assumed there might be benefits in people yet overlooked the potential risks. Considering this intervention involves inserting stem cells into the brain via the assistance of a viral strain known to be harmful to humans, it’s logical to assume there could be some safety concerns. It also overplayed the novelty here by quoting an expert who called it a “tour de force” and a “breakthrough.”

The medication used in the FAME 2 trial consisted of a combination of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-lowering drugs as required by current treatment guidelines.\n\nPCI is a minimally-invasive procedure where modern stents - small tubular metal scaffolds coated with medication - are inserted into an artery using a small catheter to widen a narrowed blood vessel in the heart. PCI is commonly used to treat sudden blockages of a coronary artery that cause a heart attack. In situations where the heart\'s arteries narrow less suddenly and do not cause a heart attack but induce chest pain during exercise - a condition known as stable coronary artery disease - it has remained unclear whether PCI in addition to medication was better than medication alone in preventing future heart attacks.\n\n""Currently, the standard practice in North America is to prescribe medication to patients with stable coronary artery disease and avoid PCI,"" said Dr. Peter Jüni, Director of the Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael\'s Hospital, who is a senior author on the study. ""Our results pose the question: Would a large portion of patients benefit from early PCI in addition to medication?""\n\n""We used pressure measurements inside the heart arteries to find coronary arteries that should be widened,"" said Dr. Bernard De Bruyne, an interventional cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Center Aalst in Belgium and the Principal Investigator of the trial. ""With these measurements we were able to identify patients who would benefit from PCI in addition to medication.""\n\nThe World Health Organization reports that every year, 17.7 million people die from cardiovascular diseases, which is an estimated 31 per cent of all deaths worldwide. Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in North America and Europe, and is a serious health problem worldwide. It occurs when the coronary arteries become narrow and hardened due to the build-up of cholesterol rich plaques in the blood vessels. While the FAME 2 trial showed that PCI reduced urgent hospital admissions and revascularizations and likely reduced heart attacks, it did not provide evidence for a difference between PCI and medication alone in the prevention of deaths.\n\nThe trial was initially sponsored by St. Jude Medical, a global medical device company, until the three-year follow-up.

Nineteen sites across Europe and North America participated in the five-year follow-up.\n\n""Our trial over its entire follow-up shows us that the longer you observe these patients, the more pronounced the benefits of the initial PCI become,"" said Dr. Jüni, who is also a Canada Research Chair and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto.\n\nWhile Drs.

Through the Keenan Research Centre and the Li Ka Shing International Healthcare Education Centre, which make up the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, research and education at St. Michael\'s Hospital are recognized and make an impact around the world. Founded in 1892, the hospital is fully affiliated with the University of Toronto.\n\nMedia contact']","The release also doesn’t mention potential harms of PCI, put the size of the benefit in context, or disclose conflicts of interest.","This news release advocates for the benefits of a procedure to unblock coronary arteries called PCI or percutaneous coronary intervention. It involves snaking a catheter through a patient’s arteries to the site of the coronary narrowing; a metal stent is then inserted to help keep the artery open. The release claims that adding this procedure to drug treatment is “better” than the standard practice of offering drug treatment alone in patients with stable coronary artery disease (narrowing of the coronary arteries that produces chest pain when the individual exercises but is otherwise not a problem).
The basis for this definitive-sounding claim is the 5-year follow-up data from a study dubbed FAME-2. But there’s a problem: the FAME-2 data are far from definitive, and the news release doesn’t acknowledge any of the extensive limitations and caveats that must be applied to these results. The release also doesn’t mention potential harms of PCI, quantify the size of the apparent benefit, or disclose the many financial relationships the study authors have with companies that make devices to perform PCIs.
The result is an incomplete and one-sided portrayal of a complicated issue — a document that cheer-leads for a specific approach rather than fully informing the reader.

It measures the damage to the DNA of white blood cells when subjected to different intensities of ultraviolet (UV) light, revealing measurable differences in the cells\' susceptibility to further damage in patients with cancer.\n\nThe damage forms a \'comet tail\' of DNA pieces that are pulled towards the positive end of an electric field. The longer the comet tail, the more DNA damage is present, which correlates with the presence of cancer. In a 2014 proof of concept study, the Bradford researchers showed they could identify which samples were from patients with three different types of cancer - even those who had yet to be diagnosed - with 93 per cent success.\n\nHowever, in their two most recent clinical trials of the test involving over 700 blood samples from colorectal and prostate cancer patients (and further breast and lung cancer samples that were available), they were unable to distinguish those with cancer from healthy patients in 60 cases.\n\nTo determine whether scoring more cells on the slides would explain this \'challenging subgroup\', lead researcher Professor Diana Anderson from the University of Bradford asked IMSTAR, to reanalyse the inconclusive slides. The Bradford team had scored 100 cells per slide, but the Pathfinder™ system is able to analyse up to 10,000 cells per slide, and uses Artificial Intelligence concepts in its proprietary software.\n\nScoring a minimum of 2,000 cells per slide, the IMSTAR Pathfinder™ system was able to separate all individuals of the cancer group from the healthy control group with confirmed statistical significance. These findings are published in FASEB BioAdvances journal.\n\nProfessor Anderson said: ""This test is different from other universal cancer tests being developed, because it is not looking for a specific biomarker or mutation. This is a generic test for cancer in an individual, regardless of the underlying mechanism that\'s causing their cancer.\n\n""I\'m now convinced that if we used the powerful IMSTAR system to look at thousands of cells on all the slide samples in the trials, we would see a significant increase in the overall predictability beyond the original 93 per cent of the original 2014 study.""\n\nParis-based company IMSTAR has now coupled the innovative technology developed at Bradford with their fully-automated Pathfinder™ cell reader-analyser to create a powerful and robust test for early detection, called TumorScan™.\n\nCo-first author Dr Mojgan Najafzadeh from the University of Bradford said: ""We feel that we\'ve taken it as far as we can in proving that the test works with high predictability for cancer outcome, and IMSTAR are the right partners to improve it still further.""\n\nDr Francoise Soussaline, PhD, DSc, IMSTAR\'s president said: ""To bring a universal \'liquid biopsy\' blood test for cancer to market, it must achieve a number of criteria, including high sensitivity and specificity and be fully automated with high throughput for a medical routine use. In addition, test results must be available in 24hrs and at affordable cost.\n\n""We believe that the combination of Bradford\'s innovation and IMSTAR\'s unique expertise has shown that TumorScan can achieve these requisites.""\n\nIMSTAR\'s vice-president for medical applications, Dr Michel Soussaline, confirmed that the company will be working to automate the full test workflow further to take it to market.\n\n###']",It’s important to keep in mind that all cancer screening tests carry risks.,"Blood tests have become a popular study focus among scientists seeking mechanisms for early detection of cancer. Researchers have come up with a number of tests in recent years that examine a variety of components of blood, among them types of blood cells, proteins, and the presence of mutated DNA.  Most of the tests are specific to particular cancers and vary in their levels of accuracy.
In this release, a team at the University of Bradford heralds the increasing accuracy of a test that measures the response of white blood cells exposed to ultraviolet light. The test, called TumorScan, uses an automated cell reader designed by a Paris-based company, IMSTAR, to examine thousands of cells from any one sample, and the researchers say that they have found the process can detect the presence of any type of cancer with more than 90% success.  IMSTAR has now licensed the university team’s technology and plans to bring the text to market some time in the future.
The release touts the potential benefits without addressing some real concerns: Technology like this is enabling us to find more and more cancers at an earlier stage, but we are often unable to differentiate between the ones that need to be treated and those that can be monitored or ignored. While the news release didn’t need to go into great detail about this, it should at least acknowledge the downsides.

""There is evidence that both omega-3s from plants and marine sources are protective against cancer and we wanted to determine which form is more effective.""\n\nThere are three types of omega-3 fatty acids: a-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA is plant-based and found in such edible seeds as flaxseed and in oils, such as soy, canola and hemp oil. EPA and DHA are found in marine life, such as fish, algae and phytoplankton.\n\nPublished in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, the study involved feeding the different types of omega-3s to mice with a highly aggressive form of human breast cancer called HER-2.

""It\'s known that EPA and DHA can inhibit breast tumour growth, but no one has looked directly at how effective these omega-3s are compared to ALA.""\n\nMa found overall exposure to marine-based omega-3s reduced the size of the tumours by 60 to 70 per cent and the number of tumours by 30 per cent.\n\nHowever, higher doses of the plant-based fatty acid were required to deliver the same impact as the marine-based omega-3s.\n\nOmega-3s prevent and fight cancer by turning on genes associated with the immune system and blocking tumour growth pathways, said Ma.\n\n""It seems EPA and DHA are more effective at this. In North America, we don\'t get enough omega-3s from seafood, so there lies an opportunity to improve our diet and help prevent the risk of breast cancer.""\n\nBased on the doses given in the study, Ma said humans should consume two to three servings of fish a week to have the same effect.\n\nBesides certain foods containing EPA and DHA, supplements and functional foods, such as omega-3 eggs or DHA milk, can offer similar cancer prevention effects, he added.\n\nThe next step is to investigate the effects of omega-3s on other forms of breast cancer.\n\n""Seeing the significant benefits omega-3s can have in combatting a highly aggressive form of breast cancer means omega-3s will likely be beneficial for other types of cancer.""\n\n###']",The news release offers unwarranted medical advice while omitting any caution about the limitations of using mouse studies to predict human outcomes.,"This news release reports on a study of tumor growth in mice with an aggressive form of breast cancer who were fed varying types of omega-3s.

Kelly Nichols, O.D., Ph.D., a dry eye expert and dean of the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry, conducted research studies for the parent drug company to explore the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast in treating this eye condition that affects more than 16 million adults in the United States.\n\nInflammation associated with dry eye may eventually lead to damage to the surface of the eye.\n\n“Dry eye is a common complaint to eye care professionals, with millions of U.S. adults experiencing the symptoms of this often chronic disease,” Nichols said. “It is critical for eye care professionals to have a dialogue with patients who report symptoms because dry eye can be a progressive ocular surface disease.”\n\nThe twice-daily eye drop solution of 5 percent lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of dry eye, and it is the first new dry eye prescription drop approved in the last 13 years.\n\nNichols and a team of researchers studied 1,181 patients, of whom 1,067 received lifitegrast in four placebo-controlled 12-week trials. Signs and symptoms were assessed at baseline and at weeks two, six and 12.\n\nIn all four studies, eye dryness was significantly reduced, with two of the studies showing improvements at week two. Results from inferior corneal staining tests — used by physicians to detect abrasions on the cornea — showed improvement in three of the four studies.\n\nNichols continues to push for funding and advancement for dry eye research and treatment. Prior to FDA approval of the lifitegrast eye drop, Nichols presented a congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., addressing research into dry eye for the National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research. She focused on the cause and potential therapies for dry eye that are being funded through the National Eye Institute and in private industry.\n\nFocusing her research on all aspects of the eye, Nichols discussed the mechanics of the three layers of the tear film and the importance of each from the cornea outward:• Mucin layer: helps tears adhere to the eye• Aqueous layer or water layer: nourishes and protects the cornea• Lipid or oil layer: lubricates and prevents evaporation and provides smooth refractive surface needed for optimal vision\n\n“We are unsure which of the 200-plus different lipids and 500-plus unique proteins are most important for protecting and lubricating the eye, and the absence or insufficiency of which results in dry eye,” Nichols said.\n\nThere are more than 30-plus new dry eye basic, translational and clinical studies being funded by the NEI/National Institutes of Health to further explore these lipids and proteins, with more than 50 papers being published monthly.\n\n“Funding from NIH is helping the optometry world make significant strides in understanding the cause and treatment of dry eye,” Nichols said. “We still have a long way to go, but prevention and early detection are major goals. There is hope for dry eye patients worldwide.”\n\nDiagnosis of dry eye is identified by an eye care professional based on careful evaluation of signs and symptoms, including dryness, discomfort, vision changes and damage to the surface of the eye. Specialty testing for dry eye is performed at the Dry Eye Relief Clinic at UAB Eye Care, in the School of Optometry.\n\nAbout UABKnown for its innovative and interdisciplinary approach to education at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, the University of Alabama at Birmingham is the state of Alabama’s largest employer and an internationally renowned research university and academic medical center; its professional schools and specialty patient-care programs are consistently ranked among the nation’s top 50.

The FDA warned, however, that the treatment also has the potential to kill other types of cells, such as skin cells, if injected improperly.\n\nPatients can receive as many as 50 injections of the drug in a single treatment, the agency said, with up to six treatments administered no less than a month apart. That might seem like a lot of pain for the pleasure of a slimmed-down chin, but currently patients looking to part with their double chins must have fat removed through more invasive means, such as liposuction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe market for the new drug could be a big one.\n\nAccording to a survey last year by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, nearly 70 percent of respondents listed ""excess fat under the chin/neck"" as a key concern about their appearance. And Americans repeatedly have demonstrated a willingness to shell out money for aesthetic treatments intended to improve their appearance, if not their overall health. A top example: Annual sales of the anti-wrinkle drug Botox have surged to $2 billion in recent years.\n\nKeith Leonard, chief executive of Kythera, the California-based firm that developed Kybella, said at a conference last month that he believes the new treatment ""can drive a very large market and leave very satisfied patients.""\n\nAD\n\nThe FDA said Kybella demonstrated safety and efficacy in two clinical trials involving more than 1,000 adults.

The most common side effects included swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, redness and areas of hardness in the vicinity of the injection. FDA officials said Kybella should be administered only by a ""licensed health care professional,"" and shouldn\'t be injected anywhere other than below the chin.\n\nA Kythera representative said Wednesday that the new treatment likely won\'t be available until June, as it must train doctors to administer Kybella, and that the company would not have more details about the potential cost of the drug until after its launch.\n\nAD']",This story didn’t satisfactorily address some key questions about a new treatment for double chins and seeks no outside expert perspective.

(Nov. 16, 2016) - Researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus have found that high doses of vitamin D reduce the incidence of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in older, long-term care residents.\n\nThe findings of the clinical trial, published today in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, could help reduce one of the leading causes of serious illness, debilitation and death among patients in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.\n\n""After studying these patients for a year, we found a 40 percent reduction in acute respiratory illness among those who took higher doses of vitamin D,"" said the study\'s lead author, Adit Ginde, MD, MPH, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. ""Vitamin D can improve the immune system\'s ability to fight infections because it bolsters the first line of defense of the immune system.""\n\nGinde said in older people that first line of defense is often impaired. But vitamin D can reinforce it and prevent illnesses like pneumonia, influenza and bronchitis.\n\nIt may also prevent infections and exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) like emphysema.\n\nAt the same time, Ginde found that those who received higher doses of vitamin D also saw an increase in falls. The falls were lower in those given smaller doses rather than higher monthly doses of vitamin D.\n\nThe clinical trial, the first to examine vitamin D\'s impact on respiratory infections in nursing home residents, looked at 107 patients with an average age of 84 over a 12 month period. Of those, 55 received high doses of vitamin D or 100,000 units monthly (averaging 3,300-4,300 units daily). And 52 received lower doses averaging between 400-1,000 units daily. Those with higher doses saw ARIs cut nearly in half. They also had over double the incidence of falls, the study said.\n\n""This finding requires a confirmatory trial, including whether high daily doses of vitamin D, rather than high monthly doses, makes patients less likely to fall,"" Ginde said.\n\nBut Ginde said the primary finding that vitamin D can reduce ARI is a major step forward in treating these dangerous infections.\n\n""This is a potentially life-saving discovery,"" Ginde said. ""There is very little in a doctor\'s arsenal to battle ARI, especially since most are viral infections where antibiotics don\'t work. But vitamin D seems able to potentially prevent these infections.""\n\nHe cautioned that the study is not definitive proof that vitamin D can prevent ARI but it suggests that it can and at little risk to the patient.\n\n""If our results are confirmed by a larger trial, high dose vitamin D, ideally using daily dosing to minimize fall risk, has the potential for substantial public health benefit through ARI prevention for the large and growing population of long term care residents,"" Ginde said.\n\n###\n\nThe study co-authors include Patrick Blatchford, PhD, Keith Breese, MA, Lida Zarrabi, MPH, Sunny Linnebur, PharmD, Jeffrey Wallace, MD, MPH and Robert Schwartz, MD. All are from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.']","The release, however, falls short on describing costs, benefits, alternatives, and funding sources.","This a tidy little release that gives just enough information for reporters to decide whether it’s newsworthy. The release summarizes a randomized clinical trial which enrolled 107 elderly nursing home patients. Half the enrolled patients received a very large dose of vitamin D (3,300-4,300 units daily) and the controls were given a lower dose (400-1,000 units daily). The outcome of interest was that the high dose patients developed fewer respiratory infections than the control group. However, the patients in the high dose group also had more falls.
What the release lacks is the right context to help readers understand the significance of the findings. We love the fact that, unlike most news releases, it makes mention of the potential side effects, twice even. But it falls short on a discussion of costs, benefits, alternatives, and funding sources. These would have been easy additions that would have added marginally to the length of the release.

""It actually supports the idea of actionable things women can do before they become pregnant, and right as conception happens.""\n\nExperts have known for some time that taking folic acid can prevent neural tube birth defects like spina bifida in developing fetuses. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines call for all women of child-bearing age - not just those who plan to get pregnant - to take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily to prevent birth defects. The same dose appears to provide some benefit in preventing autism, according to the research.\n\n""This is another piece of evidence that supports the beneficial uses of folic acid during pregnancy,"" said Halladay, who was not connected with the study.\n\nThe research ""strongly suggests that taking folic acid prior to pregnancy may reduce the risk of autism in children,"" said Dr. Edward R.B. McCabe, medical director for the March of Dimes. The organization also recommends women of child-bearing age take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily before conceiving and 600 to 800 micrograms per day while pregnant.\n\nBut some experts aren\'t quite ready to tout the benefits of folic acid too loudly, particularly for autism prevention.\n\n""It is possible that folic acid ... might provide protection against other neurodevelopmental disorders like autism,"" said Zachary Warren, director of the Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Vanderbilt University, who was also not involved in the study. ""While the current study suggests such protection... the data really do not establish anything close to a causal connection.""\n\nThe Norwegian researchers do admit that more studies should be done to confirm the link.\n\nWarren says he wishes the solution were as simple as just taking folic acid. ""Caring for individuals with autism and their families would be a whole lot easier if we had simple answers about cause and risk,"" he says. ""The reality is, autism is a complex disorder and our best answers about causes and treatment are going to be complex as well.""\n\nDespite the fact that a link between taking folic acid and reducing autism risk isn\'t fully proven, Halladay says there\'s no harm in taking the supplement, and women should be taking it anyway to prevent birth defects.']","Good sourcing, but language and statistical problems were prominent shortcomings in this story. Didn’t grade as well as the stories by the ","There was plenty to like about this story. There are quotes from three experts who emphasize different perspectives on the results, and the take-home message about supplements — women should be taking them to prevent birth defects, regardless of any link to autism — is spot on. But the story gets tripped up when it uses active verbs (“may reduce” and “may prevent”) to describe the importance of the findings, and its use of relative risk figures was inadequate to convey the benefits. Presenting only the statistic “39% less likely” is particularly problematic.  Even the abstract of the paper on which the story was based provided the absolute differences: rates of autistic disorder of 0.10% for the group taking folate, and 0.21% among nonusers. This is a very small absolute risk difference – and from an observational study at that.
As a result, readers will get a somewhat-too-rosy picture of what this study found and what it means.

Increasingly, cancer will no longer be identified, categorized and treated by the organ it inhabits, or in which it first gained its foothold. In a shift that is already underway, cancers will be known by — and treated for — the common genetic mutations that nurture and sustain them.\n\nIn clinical trial evidence cited by the FDA this week, pembrolizumab induced complete or partial tumor shrinkage in about 40% of patients with one of 15 end-stage malignancies. And for 78% of those patients, that response lasted six months or more. A trial reported earlier this year found that in 17 of 30 advanced cancer patients, pembrolizumab stopped or reversed the progression of cancer, and 24 patients were still alive a year after starting the drug.\n\nAll of those subjects, of course, had cancers with the genetic mutation that pembrolizumab is designed to target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the treatment of patients with metastatic cancers that have failed all other treatments, that record of success constitutes a “home run,” said Dr. Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University’s Kimmel Cancer Center. Vogelstein’s 1993 research laid the groundwork for the discovery of pembrolizumab’s broad cancer-fighting powers.\n\nWith the FDA’s announcement, drugs like pembrolizumab have also begun to change the way that physicians, patients and government regulators think of cancer. No longer will they see all cancers of the lung, breast, colon, brain, liver, pancreas and prostate as distinct from one another. Instead, they will look for the common genetic mutations that give rise to cancers no matter where they’re found. And they’ll treat those cancers with a drug that uses that common signature as a homing beacon, either for the immune system or for targeted cancer drugs to attack.\n\nIt’s a key principle of what’s called “precision medicine” — the idea that cancer therapies should zero in on a tumor’s specific molecular fingerprint, and not, as most chemotherapies do, harm healthy cells in the process of attacking malignant ones.\n\nIn the cancers pembrolizumab treats, the mutations occur in the complex of genes that govern DNA repair. Deficiencies in the DNA’s “mismatch repair system” generate mutant proteins on the surface of cancer cells, and pembrolizumab trains the immune system to attack those targets. The mutations that make pembrolizumab effective had already been found in melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and the FDA had already approved the drug for those cancers before this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this week’s FDA approval goes further: It makes clear that the drug’s molecular targets are also common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, and less frequently present in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, and thyroid gland.\n\nAll told, scientists believe about 4% of advanced cancers bear the genetic signature that would make them treatable by Keytruda.\n\nThe appearance of such a cancer workhorse will bring about profound changes on the cancer landscape — not just for patients but for researchers and drug regulators as well.\n\nOrganizations representing, say, people with pancreatic cancer will make common cause with groups that advocate for colorectal cancer patients. In cancer centers, specialists in, say, melanoma will start (in fact, have already started) treating patients with a range of other cancers. When drug companies and their academic partners set out to test the effectiveness of a prospective cancer drug, they’ll have to recruit trial subjects using a new and much less obvious criterion than they’ve used in the past: the genetic signatures their tumors bear.\n\nEven before the FDA’s announcement this week, all these processes were underway. The FDA’s decision recognizes that fact, said Dr. Svetomir Markovic, an immunologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who specializes in treating melanoma.\n\nBut the decision also puts cancer physicians — as well as insurers, who will be called on to pay Keytruda’s $100,000-per-year price tag — on notice that a new era is at hand, said Markovic.\n\n“The field of cancer medicine is changing at lightning speed,” he said. Physicians “are having a hard time keeping up, and I can only imagine that people who are regulating it are doing the same,” he added. “But this decision by the FDA is really wonderful: It has made it easier for us to secure treatment for our patients who may have run out of options that may help.”\n\nTwo other immunotherapy drugs have been approved for cancer treatment — nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) — but neither has been shown to treat cancers across such a broad spectrum. Several other immunotherapy drugs are in early trials, and could yet prove to be the sort of workhorse that pembrolizumab appears to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In many ways we’re at the end of the beginning of immunotherapy: There’s clear benefit but it’s still a minority of patients that get long-term benefit,” said Markovic of the Mayo Institute. “We will get better at this.”\n\nMarkovic suggested that the newly recognized powers of pembrolizumab, as well as the FDA’s new openness to cancer drugs that blur traditional distinctions, could prompt drug companies, physicians and patient groups to take a second look at some abandoned cancer drugs. With a clearer idea of which patients they might help, and a willingness to design and conduct innovative clinical trials, some failures may look more promising, he said.\n\n“We just needed to take the first step in showing that this long-believed theory — that the immune system can kill cancer — is true,” Markovic added. “It indeed can.”\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\n@LATMelissaHealy']",Few readers of this story would discern that there is no evidence that any patients given Keytruda lived any longer or any better than those receiving standard therapies.,"The FDA made news by approving the use of an immunotherapy drug to treat tumors based on a genetic marker in the tumor, rather than the organ where the tumor originated. But this story about the new approval for pembrolizumab (brand name Keytruda) overlooks life threatening risks, overstates the meaning of trial results, inaccurately describes the patients who are covered by the FDA action and neglects the disappointing track record of drug approvals based on surrogate endpoints, rather than real measures of survival or quality of life. To its credit, the story does report the very high cost of the drug and appropriately highlights the novelty of a drug approval based on a biomarker.

It’s all good.","['Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Rutgers University studied 408 males from adolescence to their mid-30s. The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The early chronic users smoked a great deal -- a peak of more than 200 days per year on average when they were 22 years old.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or asthma -- in any group, even those with very high use. They controlled for cigarette smoking, other drug use, access to health insurance and other factors.\n\n""What we found was a little surprising,"" lead author Jordan Bechtold, a research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a statement.\n\nBased on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions. But there were none.\n\nAD\n\nThey also found no link to a wide range of other health issues: cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, headaches or high blood pressure.\n\nAD\n\nBechtold said the researchers wanted to ""help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana"" but that this is a very complicated issue and one, study, including his own, should not be taken in isolation and should be viewed in context of other studies on teenagers\' marijuana use.\n\nOne major limitation of the study is that it ends when the men are in their 30s ""which may be too early for decrements in health to emerge,"" the authors acknowledge. ""Therefore, continued data collection and longer follow-ups are needed.""\n\nAD\n\nUpdate: The study\'s findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis, according to the editors of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. In a lengthy clarification issued in December 2015, the journal said that by applying different models to look at the data they confirmed that there did not appear to be any link between marijuana use and health issues. However, the reanalysis regarding psychotic disorders contradicted the earlier conclusions -- that there indeed appeared to be a higher risk of psychotic disorders among marijuana users in the study versus non-users that approached statistical significance when using a more liberal test.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD']","“It’s all good,” said the headline.  We didn’t think so, which is why it got a 1-star grade.","The story describes one study of about 400 men who were followed from their teens in the late 1980s until 2010. The researchers found no increased risk of asthma, depression, lung cancer or mental illness, which the story seems to accept as a big reassurance. We felt the story did not squarely address the study limitations as described by the authors themselves in the paper.  Instead, the “surprising news” came in a single-source story, lifting quotes from a news release, without any independent perspective or adequate context.

Then President Richard Nixon declared drugs “public enemy No. 1” and the so-called “war on drugs” began. All this combined to give psychedelics a bad name at the time and led to most of them being outlawed. For nearly a generation, science on these substances shut down.\n\nTry Newsweek for only $1.25 per week\n\nBut that’s changing. In the past 20 years or so, a small amount of research has once again begun to focus on these chemicals, showing that they have promise for treating a range of conditions, from addiction to depression and anxiety, says Evan Wood, a psychiatric researcher at the University of British Columbia.\n\nIn 2006, researchers at the University of Arizona published a study showing obsessive-compulsive patients who ingested psilocybin had immediate and lasting reductions in problematic symptoms. The same year, Johns Hopkins University physician and researcher Roland Griffiths showed that in healthy volunteers, psilocybin produced lasting benefits like improved mood and peacefulness six months after ingestion. Study participants “made claims to be more sensitive, compassionate, tolerant, to have increased positive relationships, an increased need to serve others,” according to Griffiths. “Those kinds of changes are not delusional, because blinded interviews with family members, friends and work colleagues [confirm these reports].”\n\nSimilar work has shown psilocybin can help treat anxiety associated with cancer, at UCLA and New York University. Grob says work by his group and others has shown that psilocybin can help treat “terminal cancer patients with overwhelming existential anxiety, an area that traditional medicine struggles with.” And a study in late 2014 found that LSD permanently reduced anxiety in a small number of patients.\n\nWood says he’s most excited about research into using psychedelics to treat addiction, and he published a review on September 8 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal covering recent work in this field. One study from earlier this year in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found, for example, that 10 alcoholic patients given psilocybin in a controlled setting had greatly reduced cravings for and intake of alcohol in the months after the treatment. Another study, authored in 2014 by Griffiths and Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins and published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found the substance helped people give up cigarettes. Twelve out of 15 patients in this small study had given up smoking six months after a psilocybin-assisted therapy session.\n\nAyahuasca, an Amazonian brew containing dimethyltryptamine that causes hallucinations and often intense spiritual experiences, has also shown promise in treating addictions, besides anxiety and depression, Wood says. Another chemical, called MDMA, the active ingredient in the drug Ecstasy, can help treat post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nPsychedelics generally are thought to work by allowing individuals to have a spiritual or “mystical” experience, during which time people can have profound realizations that permanently change their behaviors, Wood says. The idea that you can take a medicine one or a few times and become “cured,” or at least significantly helped, conflicts with current standard practices, which often involve taking medications every day for years, or life.\n\n“With even minor mental health conditions like minor depression or anxiety...or more serious problems like addiction, the existing paradigm is to frame these as chronic, lifelong diseases” that require continuous medication with drugs like serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, Wood says. But not so with psychedelics, which represent “a total paradigm shift in the way that mental illness is treated,” he adds.\n\nHe points out that psychedelics should never be used carelessly, and that the “set and setting” (meaning the dose, mood, environment, company and surroundings) where a person takes them are of paramount importance. That said, when studied under controlled and supervised conditions, these chemicals have not been found to cause lasting negative health consequences, the Canadian Medical Association Journal review noted. All of which adds up to a compelling argument that psychedelics “should be the focus of intensive study for treating mental illness,” Wood says.']","This story raises intriguing questions, but doesn’t provide enough detail to help readers understand what the answers might be.","Psilocybe cubensis aka “magic mushrooms”
Can psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, Ayahuasca, an Amazonian brew, or MDMA, the active ingredient in the party drug Ecstasy help people who are addicted, anxious or depressed?  That’s the question increasingly asked by researchers who are testing these psychedelic drugs in small numbers of patients to see if they bring any relief.
As the article nicely points out, mental health problems like addiction or depression are thought of as chronic, lifelong diseases, but what if that’s an ineffective approach for many people? What if anxious or depressed people were, instead, treated by a small number of episodes of  profoundly perspective-altering drugs, which rewires one’s underlying personal philosophy and brings relief that way?  Would this not represent a dramatic paradigm-crushing approach to treating mental illness?
While the story raises these questions in an intriguing fashion, details on the research are fleeting and there’s not enough context to give readers a balanced view of the issues involved. As the story points out, early results suggest that these substances might be worth substantial increases in research in treating mental illnesses. But the current evidence base is characterized by tiny numbers of subjects and is almost anecdotal in nature, so a bit more caution about the likelihood of a “paradigm shift” in this area would have been welcome.

LUNG CANCER BURDEN LUNG CANCER BURDEN The five-year survival rate is 16%. Source: American Cancer Society LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM For readers, by readers: Patients, survivors, loved ones touched by any type of cancer invited to share questions, advice, experiences ON THE WEB ON THE WEB • Q&A on the National Lung Screening Trial • Fact Sheet on the NLST • More information on lung cancer and screening\n\n\n\n• The full study, ""The National Lung Screening Trial: Overview and Study Design"" has been published by Radiology. For the first time, a large study shows that using CT scans to screen smokers and ex-smokers for lung cancer can reduce lung cancer deaths by 20% — potentially saving thousands of lives — by catching lethal tumors at an earlier, more treatable stage, according to a study released Thursday. Nearly 160,000 Americans a year die from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world, according to the American Cancer Society. In addition to reducing lung cancer deaths, the screenings also reduced deaths from any cause by 7%, according to the National Cancer Institute, which funded the eight-year, $250 million study of 53,000 people older than 55. ""This is good news,"" says Bruce Johnson of Boston\'s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who wasn\'t involved in the study. ""The reduction in deaths is comparable to mammograms, which reduce deaths by 14% to 15%."" Q&A: Should smokers get scans now? Until now, there has never been a reliable way to catch lung cancers early, when doctors can save about 70% of patients. Today, about 75% of patients are diagnosed with incurable disease. Chest X-rays, an earlier form of screening tested repeatedly in the 1970s, has never been shown to save lives, says Ned Patz, a professor of radiology at Duke University Medical Center who helped design the trial. CT scans use a higher dose of radiation and are far more sensitive, able to pick up much smaller tumors. In this study, doctors randomly assigned half of patients to get three annual screenings with either a chest X-ray or a low-dose CT scan, the study says. Everyone in the study was a smoker or ex-smoker with 30 ""pack-years"" of smoking. That\'s equivalent of smoking a pack a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years, for example. About 1.3% of those given CT scans died over five years, compared to 1.7% of those screened with chest X-rays, according to the National Cancer Institute. With 100 million smokers and ex-smokers in the USA, doctors acknowledge that the results may spur many people to ask for the scans. Any hospital can perform the scan, Johnson says. But Patz notes that doctors and healthcare leaders will have to look at the results carefully before recommending mass screenings. Avoiding smoking — which causes 87% of lung cancers — is still the best way to avoid smoking-related illness, which kills more than 400,000 Americans a year, Johnson says. But Johnson notes that most lung cancers today are diagnosed in people who don\'t smoke, either because they\'ve already quit or have never used tobacco. Many worried ex-smokers will be relieved to hear there is something they can do to reduce their risk of death, he says. Researchers say they don\'t know if CT screenings help non-smokers or people younger than 55. NCI director Harold Varmus says his agency isn\'t making any recommendations. The American Cancer Society will consider the results, but also hasn\'t yet changed its recommendations, says chief medical officer Otis Brawley. ""Right now, no medical groups endorse screening for lung cancer. The best advice we can give is to encourage people to have conversations with their doctors about whether lung cancer screening is right for them,"" Brawley says. Brawley cautioned that screening\'s benefits in the real world may not be the same as in the study. Participants in the study were all ""highly motivated"" and informed patients living in large cities, treated through a careful program at major cancer centers, Brawley says. People who are screened at community hospitals without established systems for following up on suspicious screening results may not fare as well. Right now, neither Medicare nor private insurance companies pay for lung cancer screenings with CT scans, says Varmus. He noted that the Medicare program is going to look at the results to decide on coverage. In general, CT screenings cost about $300, Varmus says. About 25% of patients in the study screened with a CT needed follow-up tests, which add to the expense. Patz says patients should think carefully before requesting a screening. While CT scans are painless, they expose patients to radiation that can potentially cause new cancers, Patz says. It\'s possible that a person scanned frequently for lung cancer could develop breast cancer as a result. The CT scans used in the study provide about 3 millisieverts of radiation, according to Denise Aberle, a leader of the new study. That\'s about the same amount of radiation in a mammogram. The chest X-rays in this study were about 0.05 millisieverts. The screenings also don\'t diagnose cancer, says Michael Unger, a professor at Philadelphia\'s Fox Chase Cancer Center, who wasn\'t involved in the study. While screenings can detect potential problems, doctors need to retrieve actual cells to confirm cancer. Making an incision through the ribs to perform a lung biopsy is a serious operation and poses significant risks of its own, Unger says. And a lung screening can\'t prevent all deaths. Significantly, 75% of deaths in the study were from causes other than lung cancer, Patz says. So, a screening may catch lung cancer early, but a patient could still die young from heart disease, emphysema, a stroke or other smoking-related condition. Also, CT screenings can surprise both doctors and patients, Brawley says. The screenings may detect suspicious lumps and bumps outside the lungs, Brawley says. That can be good — if the scan detects an actual problem. But those surprise findings can cause needless worry, pain and expense if they turn out to be benign. Unger notes that the study leaves many important questions unanswered, such as: At what age should people begin screening? How often should they get screened? Who is high-risk enough to need a screening? Doctors will look into all those questions while figuring out a way to get affordable screenings to those who are most likely to benefit, Johnson says. Health officials can now provide mammograms for $100 or less, which has made it possible to get them to large numbers of women, including poor people without regular access to healthcare. ""We as a medical community now need to figure out how to do this in a way that the cost is acceptable to the public,"" Johnson says. Insurance companies don\'t pay for lung screenings, according to the National Cancer Institute. The Medicare program plans to review the study results to decide whether to cover screenings for high-risk people, says Harold Varmus, National Cancer Institute director.

His participation in a study of MDMA, the drug commonly known as ecstasy, proved life-saving. (Travis Dove/For The Washington Post)\n\nFor Jon Lubecky, the scars on his wrists are a reminder of the years he spent in mental purgatory.\n\nHe returned from an Army deployment in Iraq a broken man. He heard mortar shells and helicopters where there were none. He couldn’t sleep and drank until he passed out. He got every treatment offered by Veterans Affairs for post-traumatic stress disorder. But they didn’t stop him from trying to kill himself — five times.\n\nFinally, he signed up for an experimental therapy and was given a little green capsule. The anguish stopped.\n\nInside that pill was the compound MDMA, better known by dealers and partygoers as ecstasy. That street drug is emerging as the most promising tool in years for the military’s escalating PTSD epidemic.\n\nThe MDMA program was created by a small group of psychedelic researchers who had toiled for years in the face of ridicule, funding shortages and skepticism. But the results have been so positive that this month the Food and Drug Administration deemed it a “breakthrough therapy” — setting it on a fast track for review and potential approval.\n\nA dose of MDMA in the office of South Carolina psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer, who has studied its use as a treatment for PTSD. (Travis Dove/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe prospect of a government-sanctioned psychedelic drug has generated both excitement and concern. And it has opened the door to scientists studying new uses for other illegal psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (commonly known as magic mushrooms).\n\n“We’re in this odd situation where one of the most promising therapies also happens to be a Schedule 1 substance banned by the [Drug Enforcement Administration],” said retired Brig. Gen. Loree Sutton, who until 2010 was the highest-ranking psychiatrist in the U.S. Army.\n\nBecause of the stigma attached to psychedelics since the trippy 1960s, many military and government leaders still hesitate to embrace them. Some scientists are also wary of the nonprofit spearheading ecstasy therapy, a group with the stated goal of making the banned drugs part of mainstream culture.\n\nBut the scope and severity of PTSD makes it all irrelevant, said Sutton, who now works as New York City’s commissioner of veteran services. “If this is something that could really save lives, we need to run and not walk toward it. We need to follow the data.”\n\nPTSD has been a problem for the military for decades, but America’s recent wars have pushed it to epidemic-level heights. Experts estimate that between 11 and 20 percent of soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.\n\nThe affliction is typically triggered after experiencing or witnessing violence, including assault and abuse. It has ravaged lives and broken up marriages. It often leaves its victims in sudden panic and prevents them from dealing with the original trauma.\n\nAnd that last symptom is what makes PTSD particularly hard to overcome with traditional talk therapy. Because patients can’t talk about and process the trauma, experts say, it lingers like a poison in their mind.\n\nRick Doblin founded a nonprofit advocating research into the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs. (Nirvan Mullick)\n\nOnly two drugs are approved for treating PTSD: Zoloft and Paxil. Both have proved largely ineffective when it comes to veterans, whose cases are especially difficult to resolve because of their prolonged or repeated exposure to combat.\n\n“If you’re a combat veteran with multiple tours of duty, the chance of a good response to these drugs is 1 in 3, maybe lower,” said John Krystal, chairman of psychiatry at Yale University and a director at the VA’s National Center for PTSD. “That’s why there’s so much frustration and interest in finding something that works better.”\n\nEcstasy has long been a favorite at trance parties and raves because of its unique ability to flood users with intense feelings of euphoria. But as a byproduct, it also reduces fear and imbues users with a deep sense of love and acceptance of themselves and others — the perfect conditions for trauma therapy.\n\nBy giving doses of MDMA at the beginning of three, eight-hour therapy sessions, researchers say they have helped chronic PTSD patients process and move past their traumas.\n\nIn clinical trials with 107 patients closely monitored by the FDA, 61 percent reported major reductions in symptoms — to the point where they no longer fit the criteria for PTSD. Follow-up studies a year later found 67 percent no longer had PTSD.\n\n“If you were to design the perfect drug to treat PTSD, MDMA would be it,” said Rick Doblin, who three decades ago founded the California nonprofit behind the clinical trials.\n\nIt is no accident that the group — the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) — chose PTSD as its argument for ending the government’s ban on psychedelics.\n\n“We wanted to help a population that would automatically win public sympathy,” he said. “No one’s going to argue against the need to help them.”\n\nDoblin, now 63, talks openly about his own history with drugs. He began tripping on LSD as a rebellious, long-haired college freshman in the 1970s. He says it helped him see the world and himself in new ways. He wanted to become a therapist and use psychedelics to help others achieve similar insights, but he couldn’t because LSD was already banned.\n\n“The flaw of the early psychedelic movement was that they made it countercultural, a revolution,” he said. “Culture is dominant. Culture is always going to win.”\n\nFor a decade, he worked in construction until he came across MDMA for the first time. When the DEA moved to criminalize it in 1984, Doblin created MAPS and sued the agency. The lawsuit failed, and Doblin realized that psychedelics were perceived as too fringe to win public support.\n\nTo succeed, he decided, both he and the issue had to go mainstream.\n\nDoblin talked his way into the public policy PhD program at Harvard University and learned to navigate the federal bureaucracy. He shaved off his mustache, cut his shaggy hair and learned to dress up.\n\n“I used to laugh about how simple it was,” he said. “You put on a suit, and suddenly everyone thinks you’re fine.”\n\nThe external switch reflected an internal one as well. Instead of fighting government officials, he began plotting to win them over, especially those at the FDA.\n\nAnd the key, he realized, was science.\n\nBefore the FDA would even talk about clinical trials for MDMA, the agency needed proof it wasn’t dangerous. Previous studies suggesting its neurotoxicity had been limited to rats. So in 1986, Doblin scraped together money to buy monkeys for those same researchers, who found the risks to be much less at human-equivalent doses than previously thought.\n\nThe next step was investigating MDMA’s effects on people. Doblin again raised money to fly psychedelic users he had befriended to Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University for spinal taps. The studies were approved by review boards at both institutions. Doblin also participated, undergoing two spinal taps.\n\nIn the two decades that followed, Doblin and MAPS inched toward progress.\n\nThe nonprofit grew from a one-man band to a staff of 25 with headquarters in Santa Cruz. It tapped into the scene in Silicon Valley — where many tech entrepreneurs have used psychedelics to spark creativity. (Steve Jobs famously praised LSD as “one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life.”)\n\nMAPS received a $5.5 million bequest from the founder of a software company. The hipster soap company Dr. Bronner’s pledged $5 million. A professional poker player who attributed his wins to microdosing on LSD gave $25,000. Recently, an anonymous $21,000 bitcoin donation came in.\n\nMuch of that money funded small-scale clinical trials, which laid the groundwork for the last remaining hurdle: Large-scale “phase 3” trials that will begin next year, involving 200 to 300 patients in 14 locations.\n\nIf those future trials yield similar results, the FDA could approve the MDMA treatment for PTSD as soon as 2021, according to Doblin.\n\nYet his dream extends beyond that. He envisions a future where psychedelic treatment centers are in every city — places people can visit for enhanced couples therapy, spiritual experiences and personal growth. He believes psychedelics can help address the country’s biggest problems, including homelessness, war and global warming.\n\n“These drugs are a tool that can make people more compassionate, tolerant, more connected with other humans and the planet itself,” he said.\n\nThat kind of talk makes many in the medical community nervous.\n\nIt’s hard to measure the exact dangers of ecstasy. Because it is not used as widely as marijuana or cocaine, for example, fewer statistics are available on overdoses or injuries. In 2011, a public health monitoring system identified 22,498 emergency department visits nationwide related to ecstasy.\n\nMDMA researchers point out that one key difference between MDMA and street ecstasy (along with another variant called “molly”) is the street versions often contain other harmful drugs, experts say. Sometimes the pills don’t even contain MDMA.\n\nBut even in its purest clinical form, MDMA can pose risks. At high doses, it can cause the body to overheat. It can cause anxiety and increase the stress hormone cortisol. Chronic use can also cause memory impairment.\n\n“I think it’s a dangerous substance,” said Andrew Parrott, a psychology professor at Swansea University in Wales who spent years researching the drug’s harmful effects. He worries that FDA approval for the treatment of PTSD could lead many in the public to believe ecstasy is safe for recreational use.\n\nOther experts, however, have become increasingly intrigued by its promising results.\n\n“Anytime you have an organization that is advocating for drugs that are illegal, it marginalizes them in the research field. MAPS still isn’t seen as mainstream. But it’s possible they have a point here,” said Krystal, the Yale psychiatrist, who has not been involved with the group’s research. “I can’t think of a single medication that doesn’t carry some side effect. The question here is whether the benefits outweigh the risk.”\n\nFor Lubecky, the drug can’t be approved fast enough.\n\nThe Marine Corps and Army veteran recalls coming home from Iraq in 2006 to discover his wife had left him, sold his motorcycle and taken his dog. That, coupled with the trauma of what he had seen at war, sent him over the edge.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, he put the muzzle of his Beretta to his temple and pulled the trigger. The gun malfunctioned, he said, “but that microsecond after the hammer fell is when I finally felt at peace because I knew the pain would finally be over.”\n\nOne incident in Iraq in particular tormented him — a shot he took while protecting his unit. “It was a situation where the right thing to do was the immoral thing,” he said, declining to describe it in detail. “You’re looking through a scope at another human being, and you do one thing and suddenly they don’t exist anymore.”\n\nFor years he told no one about it. He would panic even thinking about it.\n\nAfter he was accepted into the MDMA clinical trial in South Carolina, he found himself on a futon with two counselors on either side as the effects of the drug sank in.\n\n“I was in such a comfortable place,” recalled Lubecky, 40, who now works in Charleston as a political consultant. “I didn’t even realize I was finally talking about it, admitting it for the first time to anybody.”\n\nSince then, he said, he has learned to accept what happened in Iraq. And the guilt he now struggles with is the fact he got chosen over others for the clinical trial.\n\n“I was the 26th veteran chosen for a 26-person study,” he said. “I have friends who are suffering every day like I was. But they can’t do it because it’s illegal.

An important element of the narrative is the dominant role of a nonprofit organization, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which is dedicated to ending government bans on psychedelic substances and marijuana and has funded virtually all of the extant research on MDMA’s impact on PTSD sufferers. While the story is well-sourced, the text fails to explore this conflict of interest. It also may land too heavily on the side of “probable” rather than “possible.”
The headline—Ecstasy could be “breakthrough” therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD—is worded conditionally but clearly heralds the dawn of a new age.
Given the long clinical trial road ahead, despite MDMA’s “breakthrough” status designation, much could change.

The women who took the 10-week stress-management class shortly after surgery reported feeling better and having fewer depressive symptoms such as anxiety than those who took a one-day, breast-cancer education session.\n\nJamie Stagl worries that women with breast cancer don\'t get enough help coping with their diagnosis. Cancer upends a woman\'s daily routine, her sense of her body, her vision of the future. There\'s almost nothing more stressful.\n\nThe women felt better one year after the course, five years later, and — according to a new study published last month in the journal Cancer — an average of 11 years later. (Stagl and her colleagues tracked down 100 of the original participants; another 30 had died; and 110 couldn\'t be found or didn\'t want to participate.)\n\nThe positive results surprised even Stagl. ""It\'s quite amazing,"" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStagl doesn\'t know whether the women are still using the techniques they were taught — which include mindfulness, deep breathing, visual imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy, and learning how to ask for help from friends and family. But the study suggests that they have internalized the strategies.\n\nWomen may be particularly receptive to these approaches when they\'re coping with a cancer diagnosis, said Laura S. Porter, an associate professor at Duke University Medical Center. ""This is really a teachable moment.""\n\nThe skills taught in the course are useful at many stressful moments, Porter said, not just when cancer is diagnosed. But most people aren\'t explicitly trained how to cope with stressful events.\n\n""These are really good life skills,"" Porter said. ""While I certainly wouldn\'t say that anyone could take a 10-week course and be set for life, I think anyone could take a 10-week course and be much better at coping with stress.""\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext, the study team, led by Michael Antoni of the University of Miami, hopes to show that an easier-to-manage five-week group class works as well as the 10-week one.\n\nAnd researchers want to know whether relaxation actually reduces the recurrence of breast cancer. It makes biological sense, Stagl said. Stress drives up levels of the hormone cortisol, which is known to weaken the immune system. If a woman\'s stress level remains high indefinitely after diagnosis, she may have a worse outcome than if she can bring it back down, Stagl said.\n\nKAREN WEINTRAUB']",Less than half of the patients who participated in a group stress management program 11 years ago were recruited into a long-term follow-up study of their outcomes. We thought that key limitation deserved some discussion in this story about the study.,"The story discusses a recent paper in the journal Cancer, which states that patients who participated in a 10-week stress management group after treatment for breast cancer reported a higher quality of life eight to 15 years later. The story emphasizes the positive impact that stress management training can have on the long-term physical and emotional well-being of breast cancer survivors. However, the story could have done more to highlight the limitations of the study and to consider the cost and feasibility of the group program.

Concerns about colon health have definitely been a boon for the alternative medicine industry. Herbalists, naturopaths and other alternative practitioners often claim that they can improve a person’s overall health, mood and energy levels simply by cleaning and detoxifying the colon.\n\nPeople who don’t want to hire a professional have lots of options for a do-it-yourself colon cleaning. NuAge Colon Cleanse from NuAge Labs is one of many over-the-counter supplements that claim to be up to the task. The NuAge website says that the product contains “muciligenic fibers,” but it doesn’t provide any other information about ingredients or directions for use. (NuAge Labs did not respond to requests for information.) According to the site, a month’s supply costs a little less than $90.\n\nOxy-Powder, a supplement from Global Healing Center, takes a low-fiber approach to colon health. Each capsule contains a little less than 700 milligrams of “ozonated magnesium oxides,” about 6 milligrams of the metallic element germanium and 25 milligrams of citric acid. Users are instructed to take four capsules with a glass of water before going to bed. They are told to increase the dose by two capsules every night until they have three to five bowel movements in a day, continue that dose for seven days then cut back to two or three times a week. A bottle of 120 capsules costs about $45.\n\nThe claims\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NuAge website says that the supplement can “break down deadly toxins” while helping users “lose excess weight” and “increase energy and focus.” The home page features a slim model wrapping a measuring tape around her bottom, driving home the promise of weight loss.\n\nThe Oxy-Powder site claims that the supplement can “clean the entire 25 to 30 feet of the digestive tract.” It further explains that such cleaning is important because “the average adult by age 40 has between 10 and 20 pounds of hard compacted fecal matter lodged in their intestinal tract.” Daniel Davis, a consumer service manager for the Global Healing Center, explained in a phone interview that the oxygen bubbles released from the magnesium oxide forcibly break up these stubborn chunks of fecal matter. He also claimed that oxygen is a “powerful antioxidant” that can help clean up dangerous free radicals throughout the body.\n\nThe idea that typical adults are walking around with a heavy burden of toxic sludge in their colons is one of the foundations of the alternative colon health industry. The website colon-cleanse-information.com, which links to the Oxy-Powder site, claims that constipated people “can be carrying around up to 40 pounds or more of toxic fecal matter, which is continually poisoning their body and organs.”\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lower digestive tract really does set a foundation for health and well-being, says Dr. John Inadomi, chairman of gastrointestinal medicine at UC San Francisco and chairman of the Clinical Practice and Quality Management Committee for the American Gastroenterological Assn. Among other things, what goes on in the colon can shape the immune system in the rest of the body, he explains.\n\nBut claims that colon cleansing supplements can somehow detoxify the colon and improve overall health “have no basis in science,” he says.\n\nThe often-repeated claim that most colons are clogged with 10, 20 or even 40 pounds of impacted material is ridiculous, Inadomi says. He notes that people preparing for a colonoscopy have to take a strong laxative that completely cleans out the colon. Even with this total scrubbing, “they only lose a couple of pounds, maybe 5 at the most,” he says. He’s never heard of anyone losing anything close to 40 pounds: “You’d have to check the ‘Guinness Book of World Records’ for that one,” he says.\n\nThere’s also no reason to think that waste in the colon is full of disease-causing toxins, says Dr. David Kastenberg, an associate professor of medicine and co-director of nutrition and metabolic diseases at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. He notes that people who suffer from constipation — who presumably would be in the biggest danger — don’t seem to be especially likely to come down with colon cancer or any other disease.\n\nKastenberg sees lots of red flags surrounding NuAge and Oxy-Powder. He’s never heard of “muciligenic fibers,” the one ingredient mentioned on the NuAge website. (The term also failed to show up in a search of a medical journal database.) As for Oxy-Powder, he seriously doubts that oxygen would have any power to clean the colon. “We give oxygen to people in hospitals all the time, and they don’t explode with bowel movements,” he says. He had a good laugh over the claim that oxygen is a powerful antioxidant. (As the name implies, antioxidants work by blocking oxidation. Calling oxygen an antioxidant is like saying that water is good for drying things out.)\n\nAnd then there’s the question of safety. Kastenberg warns that the large amounts of magnesium in Oxy-Powder could be dangerous for people with kidney trouble. Inadomi adds that germanium, another ingredient in Oxy-Powder, is considered a potential “human health hazard” by the Food and Drug Administration. Because NuAge doesn’t disclose ingredients on its site, neither Kastenberg nor Inadomi could speculate on the potential safety of that product.\n\nBoth experts agree that colon cleansing is no way to slim down. “I can’t even fathom how this would help you lose weight” over the long term, Inadomi says.\n\nhealth@latimes.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurious about a consumer health product?

Among 80 cancer patients who participated in the two trials, as many as 4 in 5 continued to feel measurably less hopeless and demoralized six months after taking the drug than they had upon their recruitment.\n\nAnd even years later, many reported they had gained — and retained — a profound sense of peace and meaning from the experience. Of 29 cancer patients who got psilocybin in a trial conducted at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, 20 rated it as “among the most meaningful” events of their life.\n\n“This drug saved my life and changed my life,” said Dinah Bazer, a Brooklyn, N.Y., woman who was administered a single dose of psilocybin at a New York treatment center in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the wake of treatment for ovarian cancer, Bazer said, her anxiety at the prospect of its return was “eating her alive.” Under the influence of a single high dose of psilocybin, Bazer said Wednesday, she became “volcanically angry” as she visualized her cancer as a dark mass bearing down on her. With an epithet, she then saw herself throwing it off.\n\n“I was bathed in God’s love” for hours after that, said Bazer, who describes herself as an atheist. When the psilocybin’s hallucinatory effects wore off, she said, two years of intense anxiety were simply gone.\n\n“This is a groundbreaking result,” said Dr. George Greer, medical director of the Heffter Research Institute, the nonprofit organization that funded the two trials.\n\nGreer suggested that the “existential anxiety” of the terminally ill is only one of many conditions that psilocybin may one day treat. Others may include treatment-resistant depression, addiction to cocaine, alcohol or tobacco, obsessive-compulsive disorder and “demoralization” in long-term survivors of HIV, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohns Hopkins University psychiatrist Dr. Roland R. Griffiths, the lead author of one of the two studies, said the enduring relief provided by a single dose of psilocybin makes such treatment more akin to surgery than it does to the plodding, labor-intensive treatments that remain the mainstay of his profession.\n\n“I really don’t think we have any models in psychiatry that look like” the effects demonstrated in the two trials, said Griffiths. “Something occurs and it’s repaired and it’s better going forward … very plausibly for more than six months,” he added. “In that sense it’s a new model.”\n\nThe publication of the two early trials, in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, marks an American return to research on the therapeutic use of hallucinogenic drugs after a hiatus of 50 years.\n\nIn the 1950s and ’60s, hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide — LSD — and psilocybin, which is found naturally in certain mushrooms, were widely used in U.S. biomedical research and in psychotherapy practices. But in 1966, as the psychedelic drugs gained a broad counterculture following in the United States, the U.S. government declared any use of the drugs illegal. By the 1970s, that ended all American research on their potential therapeutic benefits.\n\nIn recent years, a small clutch of American researchers, including the authors of the two new papers, have argued that such prohibitions might be preventing the discovery of better treatments for widespread and pressing psychiatric problems, including depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nWith PTSD epidemic among U.S. combat veterans and drug addiction a national scourge, American officials have indicated a new willingness to allow research to proceed on psychedelic and other drugs long classified as having no legitimate medical use.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration gave its blessing to conducting large-scale clinical trials of an experimental medication — 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine — better known as the party drug ecstasy.\n\nLike LSD and psilocybin, ecstasy appears to hold promise as an adjunct to psychotherapy in the treatment of PTSD. If the resulting Phase 3 trials of ecstasy demonstrate their effectiveness, the next step could be FDA approval of ecstasy as a prescription drug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe newly published trials of psilocybin are not quite so far advanced. Both studies were considered Phase 2 clinical trials, in which the safety and dosing regimens of a potential medication are still being tested. But both were considered to be double-blind placebo trials — the gold-standard of medical research in which subjects are left to guess whether they have gotten the active study drug or an inactive lookalike.\n\nIn one of the trials, researchers used a very low dose of psilocybin, much lower than that required to induce hallucinations, as a placebo. In the other, they used the dietary supplement niacin. In each trial, all of the subjects got a high dose of psilocybin in one of two sessions. So all, in the end, experienced the full effects of the drug.\n\nAll subjects in both trials had been diagnosed with cancer, and with “existential anxiety or depression” resulting from the illness and the likelihood of an early death. Participants were extensively prepared for the expected effects of the psilocybin. To minimize adverse reactions, researchers closely monitored the subjects while they were under the influence of the drug or the placebo. Afterwards, psychotherapists encouraged the subjects to write down and reflect upon the experience.\n\nImmediately after, as well as five weeks after their first session, subjects who got the psilocybin first looked much better than did those who got the placebo first. A wide range of standardized measures of depression, anxiety and quality of life showed that these subjects were less hopeless, less demoralized and less anxious.\n\nSix months out, 87% of those in the trial conducted at New York University/Langone reported their life satisfaction and/or well-being had been improved by the experience. In the larger of the two trials, conducted at Johns Hopkins University, psilocybin produced “large and significant … increases in measures of quality of life, life meaning, death acceptance, and optimism” — effects that “were sustained at six months.”\n\nPsilocybin’s side effects, meanwhile, were pretty tame. In the two trials, about 15% of subjects experienced nausea or vomiting when getting a high dose, and about 1 in 3 experienced some form of transient psychological discomfort. Many subjects’ heart rates and blood pressure rose, but none to a dangerous extent.\n\nThe potential use of psilocybin in patients diagnosed with life-threatening diseases comes at a moment when medical care at the end of life is a subject of growing concern among patients and physicians. Research finds it’s still common for dying patients to get painful and futile procedures. Palliative and hospice care, both aimed at easing the discomfort of the seriously ill, are growing specialties in American hospitals. An increasing number of patients, meanwhile, are demanding the right to die with a physician’s help.\n\nAs states debate these physician-assisted suicide bills, they should consider the implications of finding an effective treatment for the “existential distress” of the dying, said Dr. Craig D. Blinderman, a palliative care specialist at Columbia University Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It would seem to me, before we get to that point, we should explore approaches like psilocybin and hopefully not consider [physician-assisted suicide] as their only option,” said Blinderman, who was not involved in either of the two studies published Thursday.\n\nBut finding drugs like psilocybin effective is by no means the final hurdle to their widespread availability. None are currently in production, and no for-profit pharmaceutical company would likely invest millions of dollars to bring to market a pill intended effectively for one-time use.\n\nDr. Greer said that, in addition to “incubating the next generation of researchers” to explore the healing effects of psychedelic compounds, the New Mexico-based Heffter Institute is pondering a future in which specialized psychiatric clinics have routine access to psilocybin for treating patients. The institute is laying plans to scale up the production and distribution of a synthetic form of psilocybin that could make such treatments available at low cost to patients who could benefit from the drug, he said.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\nFollow me on Twitter @LATMelissaHealy and “like” Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.\n\nMORE IN SCIENCE\n\nTurn on, tune in and get better?\n\nExperiments with embryos suggest ways to make 3-parent IVF safer for babies\n\nPluto’s heavy ‘heart’ may have led to depression. Seriously']","The story discusses the potential benefits in depth, which is good, but fails to quantify those benefits, which was a weak point.","The story focuses on two recent studies that find a single application of the hallucinogen psilocybin is effective at providing meaningful relief to cancer patients suffering from severe depression or anxiety. The studies were published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, and can be found here and here.
In some ways, the story is thorough, addressing potential side effects and conflicts of interest very well. The story discusses the potential benefits in depth, which is good, but fails to quantify those benefits — which is problematic. The story also does a good job of placing the work in context, highlighting the increasing profile of research into the use of hallucinogens as therapeutic tools for mental health problems. However, the story would have been even stronger if it had discussed the existing literature on the use of psilocybin to address anxiety in cancer patients.

In addition to fruit and vegetables, the DASH diet recommends fat-free or low-fat dairy products and limits foods that are high in saturated fats and sugar. Studies have shown health benefits such as lowering high blood pressure and bad cholesterol (LDL), along with lowering body weight.\n\n""Depression is common in older adults and more frequent in people with memory problems, vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol, or people who have had a stroke,"" said study author Laurel Cherian, MD, of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. ""Making a lifestyle change such as changing your diet is often preferred over taking medications, so we wanted to see if diet could be an effective way to reduce the risk of depression.""\n\nFor the study, 964 participants with an average age of 81 were evaluated yearly for an average of six-and-a-half years. They were monitored for symptoms of depression such as being bothered by things that usually didn\'t affect them and feeling hopeless about the future. They also filled out questionnaires about how often they ate various foods, and the researchers looked at how closely the participants\' diets followed diets such as the DASH diet, Mediterranean diet and the traditional Western diet.\n\nParticipants were divided into three groups based on how closely they adhered to the diets. People in the two groups that followed the DASH diet most closely were less likely to develop depression than people in the group that did not follow the diet closely. The odds of becoming depressed over time was 11 percent lower among the top group of DASH adherers versus the lowest group. On the other hand, the more closely people followed a Western diet--a diet that is high in saturated fats and red meats and low in fruits and vegetables--the more likely they were to develop depression.\n\nCherian noted that the study does not prove that the DASH diet leads to a reduced risk of depression; it only shows an association.\n\n""Future studies are now needed to confirm these results and to determine the best nutritional components of the DASH diet to prevent depression later in life and to best help people keep their brains healthy,"" said Cherian.\n\n###\n\nRegister now for the 2018 AAN Annual Meeting Press Room in Los Angeles, April 21-27, 2018 Media Contacts:\n\nRenee Tessman, rtessman@aan.com, (612) 928-6137\n\nMichelle Uher, muher@aan.com, (612) 928-6120\n\nThe study was supported by the National Institute on Aging.\n\nLearn more about brain health at http://www. aan. com/ patients .\n\nThe American Academy of Neurology is the world\'s largest association of neurologists and neuroscience professionals, with over 34,000 members.

For example, does depression itself lead to a change in dietary patterns?","The release focuses on a forthcoming, preliminary study that will be presented at a conference in April. The release reports that people who closely follow the so-called “DASH diet” are less likely to report symptoms of depression than people who do not adhere to the DASH diet. However, there are a number of unanswered questions. For example, the study appears to have focused on older adults with an average age of 81 so it’s not clear whether the findings would be relevant for younger adults.
It’s also unclear whether depression leads to a change in dietary patterns. Common sense suggests lack of energy and motivation are negatively affected by depression and consequently may lead people to cook less frequently.  And it’s not clear how closely any of the groups being studied adhered to the DASH diet.

But most lung cancer is diagnosed when the disease is more advanced, leading to lousy overall mortality rates: Just 18 percent of all lung cancer patients survive for five years.\n\nPulmonologists have tried for years to find ways to detect lung cancer earlier. Experiments using ordinary chest X-rays proved disappointing. Then in 2011, researchers running the National Lung Screening Trial, involving 53,454 smokers and former smokers ages 55 to 74, reported encouraging findings: Patients who received a low-dose CT scan annually for three years were 20 percent less likely to die of lung cancer over an average of 6.5 years than those tested with X-rays.\n\nThose results led to the preventive services task force’s endorsement and, eventually, to Medicare’s approval. “We’re covering evidence-based preventive services for beneficiaries, which will save lives,” Dr. Conway said.\n\nHow many lives? While the overwhelming number of people with lung cancer are or were smokers, most smokers don’t develop lung cancer. So although a 20 percent reduction in mortality sounds impressive, it represents a small number of people.\n\nIn the national trial, those screened with chest X-rays had about a 1.7 percent chance of dying from lung cancer during the study period; in the CT scan group, it was about 1.4 percent.\n\nFor every thousand people screened with a low-dose CT, three fewer died of lung cancer.\n\nLay people struggle to grasp these kinds of numbers. “They look at me and say, ‘Doc, just tell me what to do,’ ” Dr. Arenberg said. Or they give a how-can-it-hurt shrug and opt in: Maybe they’ll be among the three in 1,000 saved.']","Thorough, informative reporting on the risks and benefits of participating in a new lung cancer screening program.","
Is the opportunity for Medicare recipients who are heavy smokers to receive yearly low-dose CT scans a boon or a problem? This New York Times analysis not only provides a little history about the recent Medicare decision to fund the procedure, which seeks to find lung cancer in its earlier stages, but also shares plenty of detail and context as to the likely benefits and harms of getting screened. Cost was the only one of our 10 criteria that wasn’t satisfactorily addressed. Excellent reporting on a complicated issue.

The second is serious surgery that requires general anesthesia and results in the loss of lung tissue. Both are in-patient procedures that carry the cost and other risks of hospitalizations. In about a third of the surgeries, the growth turns out to be benign, meaning the surgery was unnecessary.\n\nBut now, according to a study published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, there appears to be a new, much less invasive way of determining whether a growth is malignant. Researchers at Boston University have discovered that the thin epithelial cells that line the entire airway show changes that indicate whether a growth is malignant. With small brushes on the bronchoscope, they can take some of those cells and, using genomic testing that has been available only in recent years, reach a conclusion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe study released Sunday showed that the tests were about 97 percent accurate on 639 subjects. A private company has purchased the technology and is making it available to hospitals across the country.\n\n""Even though lung cancer tends to develop deep in your lung, all the cells that line your airway are exposed,"" said Avrum Spira, a professor of medicine at Boston University who led the research. ""They have changes in their genome.""\n\nSpira\'s test focuses on messenger RNA, the molecules that express genes\' instructions to cells. He called the technology ""a canary in the coal mine"" for lung cancer, which kills about 160,000 people in the United States each year.\n\nAD\n\nIf the test is negative, its accuracy will allow doctors to wait and watch a lesion. If it shows a malignancy, a biopsy still would be needed to confirm the cancer. ""There will still be a small number of biopsies,"" Spira said. ""But we\'re going to reduce them significantly.""\n\nAD\n\nOther research is being conducted to find markers for lung cancer, though much of it focuses on substances that can be found in the blood, Spira said. With the vast majority of lung cancer victims being smokers, the epithelial cells show changes that could be tracked once the technology became available, he said.\n\nThe next logical question is whether those changes might be detected early enough to predict and prevent lung cancer. Spira said his team already is working on research to determine whether that\'s possible.\n\nAD\n\nThe current advance was a long time in coming and shows the difficulty of bringing research from the lab to the consumer. Spira said the initial discovery was made 12 years ago, but he couldn\'t find any private group willing to put up the millions of dollars needed to conduct studies, work through the government and academic regulatory process and bring his idea to market.\n\nAD\n\nSeven years ago, he formed his own company, raised venture capital and eventually proved that his idea worked. Now his company has been purchased by Veracyte, which will take over the production and marketing of the ""Bronchial Genomic Classifier.""\n\n""We were adding 30 seconds to a minute"" to the length of a bronchoscopy, Spira said. "". . . Even then, the regulatory hurdles were significant. We got over them all, but they were significant.""\n\nCorrection: The original version of this post incorrectly named the company that is distributing the Bronchial Genomic Classifier. This version has been corrected.\n\nAD']",We like the way this story frames a less-invasive lung cancer test in terms of reduced costs and harms. But the piece really needed an independent expert to help sort out the evidence and provide context.,"This story describes results of studies reported in the New England Journal of Medicine about the value of a now commercially available genomic “classifier” test for lung cancer that has the potential to reduce unnecessary, invasive, and costly lung biopsies and surgeries. The new diagnostic test is one that relies on a proprietary RNA analysis of lung epithelial cells, and was developed with data from various procedures performed on 639 men and women. The story reports the test to be “97 percent accurate”; and it makes much of the fact that the new test will be marketed by a private company, and had to be developed over a long period of time with private venture capital and a company set up by the Boston University investigator after he struggled for years to find funding.
So far so good. But the 97% statistic comes with some qualifiers that aren’t mentioned, including the fact that this was a very carefully selected group of study patients that may not reflect the test’s performance in a broader population. And while it mentions the risks, costs, and deficiencies of needle biopsies and lung surgery to diagnose cancer, the article doesn’t mention the relatively high number of false positives revealed with use of the new test, or the cost of the new test ($3000-$4000). The absence of any independent commentators and the article’s omissions may leave readers with the impression that this test is a one-time slam-dunk diagnostic tool. In fact it’s highest value is in “re-classifying” many (mostly smokers) in an intermediate risk category to low risk, still necessitating regular CT scans and bronchoscopes.

Weitz, a cardiologist at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y., reviews data in his lab. SEARCH FACILITIES NEAR YOU SEARCH FACILITIES NEAR YOU A cholesterol drug so powerful that some researchers believe it could become the best weapon yet against heart disease has passed a critical test of its safety, researchers said Wednesday. The drug, Merck\'s anacetrapib, is the most promising in a new class of drugs designed to clear dangerous cholesterol from the arteries. Unlike statins, leading drugs that block the production of artery-clogging bad cholesterol (or LDL), the new drugs boost levels of good cholesterol (HDL), which acts as a kind of dump truck and hauls LDL away. An 18-month study of anacetrapib in 1,623 heart disease patients found that the drug had an ""unprecedented"" impact on both forms of cholesterol, lowering LDL by 40% and raising HDL by 138%, in patients who were already taking statins, says lead investigator Christopher Cannon, of Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston. ""If this pans out,"" Cannon says, ""it may turn back the clock on heart disease and push it off the top of the list as the leading killer."" Doctors caution that anacetrapib is experimental and must be tested in a bigger trial designed to show whether it actually prevents heart attacks and saves lives. If the drug succeeds, it will be at least five years before it can be sold in the U.S. ""I\'m encouraged; there\'s no other way to look at it,"" says Steven Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. ""But will this drug reduce deaths, heart attacks and stroke? We don\'t know."" The new study, released at an American Heart Association meeting and online in the New England Journal of Medicine, carried some early indications, though they\'re far from conclusive, Cannon says. Only eight patients taking the drug needed bypass surgery or angioplasty, two-thirds fewer than the 28 taking a placebo. The good news was offset by some worrisome findings. Eleven people died in the group taking anacetrapib, compared with eight taking a placebo. And 18% of patients were dropped from the study because their LDL fell so low that doctors worried they might not have enough. Only a much bigger, long-term study, Cannon says, will allow researchers to determine whether those findings pose a real risk to patients. Merck announced plans Wednesday to launch a 30,000-patient global study that is designed to show definitively whether the drug prevents heart attacks and deaths. The study\'s co-chairman, Rory Collins of Oxford University, says the organizers plan to keep the trial going for at least two and a half years even if the drug is so powerful that it quickly proves its effectiveness. ""This is a new class of drugs,"" Collins says. ""We need compelling evidence that it is both effective and safe."" Researchers are taking special pains to assure anacetrapib\'s safety, because the first drug in the class, Pfizer\'s torceptrapib, was found to cause heart attacks and deaths. An investigation showed the drug had an unexpected side effect that caused blood pressure to rise. No such side effects have been linked to anacetrapib, Merck\'s Luciano Rossetti says.

The story stumbles out of the gate with an over-the-top prediction about how the drug “may conquer heart disease.”  It continues to lay on the hype with quotes about the “incredible” results and how the drug could be “the perfect new treatment for all people at risk of a heart attack.” We realize some of this enthusiasm came from the mouths of experts but we know there are many who would be far more cautious and we didn’t hear from them in the story. It closes with an erroneous description of how many people died in the study.
Needless to say, not what we hope to see on the front page of the nation’s highest-circulating daily.
By comparison, look at how NPR closed their online story: “Still there were four deaths from cardiovascular causes among the 800 patients taking Merck’s drug compared with just one among the same number in the the just-released trial results. So don’t count Merck’s drug approved just yet.”

""Unfortunately, PSA is tissue-specific but not cancer-specific, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of biologically insignificant cancers, which is widely recognized as a key limitation in its clinical utility.""\n\nThe study directly compared the clinical performance of a new test based on PSA, called IsoPSA, to PSA itself with patients already scheduled for prostate biopsy. IsoPSA proved significantly superior to PSA in two key indications: discriminating between prostate cancer and benign conditions; and identifying patients with high-grade disease. The former indication is potentially useful for using IsoPSA for screening by primary care physicians, while the second is helpful for urologists in identifying patients who would benefit from curative intent therapy and other applications.\n\nThe results show that if validated and adopted clinically, IsoPSA could significantly reduce the rate of unnecessary biopsies by almost 50 percent. ""The methodology used in the IsoPSA assay represents a significant departure from conventional ways to define biomarkers in blood, and may be applicable to improving other cancer biomarkers,"" said Dr. Klein.\n\n""Due to its inherent simplicity, requiring only a blood draw and presenting information to the physician in familiar context using a single number - just like PSA itself - we are quite hopeful in IsoPSA\'s future utility after further validation studies,"" said Mark Stovsky, M.D., co-author and staff member, Cleveland Clinic Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute.\n\n###\n\nThe IsoPSA test was developed by Cleveland Diagnostics, a company co-founded by Cleveland Clinic, in which it has financial interest. Dr. Klein has no personal financial interest in the company. Dr. Stovsky has a leadership position (Chief Medical Officer) and investment interest in Cleveland Diagnostics, Inc. About Cleveland Clinic\n\nCleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education. Located in Cleveland, Ohio, it was founded in 1921 by four renowned physicians with a vision of providing outstanding patient care based upon the principles of cooperation, compassion and innovation. Cleveland Clinic has pioneered many medical breakthroughs, including coronary artery bypass surgery and the first face transplant in the United States. U.S. News & World Report consistently names Cleveland Clinic as one of the nation\'s best hospitals in its annual ""America\'s Best Hospitals"" survey. Among Cleveland Clinic\'s 51,000 employees are more than 3,500 full-time salaried physicians and researchers and 14,000 nurses, representing 140 medical specialties and subspecialties. Cleveland Clinic\'s health system includes a 165-acre main campus near downtown Cleveland, 10 regional hospitals, more than 150 northern Ohio outpatient locations - including 18 full-service family health centers and three health and wellness centers - and locations in Weston, Fla.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Toronto, Canada; Abu Dhabi, UAE; and London, England. In 2016, there were 7.1 million outpatient visits, 161,674 hospital admissions and 207,610 surgical cases throughout Cleveland Clinic\'s health system. Patients came for treatment from every state and 185 countries. Visit us at clevelandclinic.org. Follow us at twitter.com/ClevelandClinic.

Benefit data are given only in relative terms in this news release.","This Cleveland Clinic news release describes a “new” blood test called IsoPSA that is supposed to be more accurate than traditional prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood tests. Instead of determining PSA concentrations in the blood or other bodily fluids, IsoPSA recognizes the protein’s structural changes. Researchers believe this test could help distinguish prostate cancer from benign conditions and identify patients with high-grade disease.
It’s not exactly clear what’s new here, however. These types of structurally-based PSA tests have been around since 2009. The news release does a decent job cautioning readers on overdiagnosis and overtreatment after positive PSA tests. It also discloses conflicts of interest, as the principal investigator is a co-founder and chief medical officer of Cleveland Diagnostics — the biotech company that funded this study.
We wish we were given some numbers to put some of the claims into perspective. Benefit data were given in relative terms and described with vague, comparative wording. Also missing are discussions on the study design and limitations, as this study did not have a control group.

The annual conference is hosted by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and The Obesity Society (TOS).\n\n“The significant weight loss achieved with the Obalon 6-Month Balloon System is maintained at 12 months,” said Aurora Pryor, MD, study co-author and Chief Bariatric, Foregut and Advanced GI Surgery, Stony Brook University. “This combination of lifestyle modification and balloon therapy provides a new low risk option for patients struggling with obesity.”\n\nThe Obalon 6-Month Balloon System, a swallowable, gas-filled intragastric balloon for weight loss in adults with obesity for whom diet and exercise has failed, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It involves a balloon contained within a capsule that, once it reaches the stomach, is inflated with gas via a microcatheter. Up to three balloons may be placed over the first three months, but the entire treatment period lasts six months. The inflated balloons make patients feel full. Treatment is accompanied by a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. The device is manufactured by Obalon Therapeutics, Inc., based in San Diego, CA.\n\nResults of the study were based on a double-blinded randomized, sham-controlled trial of 387 patients, about half of whom received treatment with the Obalon balloon and the other half with a sugar-filled sham capsule designed to look like the device. Patients, who had a body mass index (BMI) of between 30 and 40, swallowed three capsules over a 12-week period (one every three weeks). All patients at the 15 study sites also underwent 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy administered by a blinded registered dietitian every three weeks. After six months, patients were informed which capsule they received and those with the Obalon balloons had them removed endoscopically.\n\nAverage percent total weight loss after six months for Obalon balloon patients was 6.81 percent, while those in the sham control group had 3.59 percent total average weight loss. Balloon-treated patients had nearly 25 percent excess weight loss. Six months after the balloons were removed, 89.5 percent of the average total weight lost during the treatment period was maintained. Researchers say a single adverse event, a bleeding gastric ulcer, occurred in one balloon patient on high dose NSAIDs who had an outpatient knee replacement procedure. Non-serious adverse device events, mostly abdominal cramping and nausea, occurred in 90.8 percent of patients (99.6% were rated mild or moderate).\n\n“There is no magic pill for obesity, but this swallowable balloon and other intragastric balloons may offer new hope to people who otherwise would not seek treatment or not have as good a result with diet and exercise alone,” said Raul J. Rosenthal, MD, ASMBS President and Chairman, Department of General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Florida, who was not involved in the study. “The balloon and other technologies may help to fill the therapeutic gaps between diet and exercise and medical therapy, and medical therapy and surgery, where the gaps are quite large.”\n\nPeople with obesity and severe obesity have higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, arthritis, sleep apnea, high blood pressure and dozens of other diseases and conditions. Studies have shown individuals with a BMI greater than 30 have a 50 to 100 percent greater risk of premature death compared to healthy weight individuals.[1][2]\n\nMetabolic/bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective and long lasting treatment for severe obesity and many related conditions and results in significant weight loss. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reported significant improvements in the safety of metabolic/bariatric surgery due in large part to improved laparoscopic techniques.[3] The risk of death is about 0.1 percent[4] and the overall likelihood of major complications is about 4 percent.[5]\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2011–2014, the prevalence of obesity was just over 36 percent in adults, with a higher prevalence among women than men (38.3% vs. 34.3%) and older than younger adults (37% vs. 32.3%). Obese is medically defined as having a body mass index (BMI), a measure of height to weight, that's more than 30. The ASMBS estimates about 24 million Americans have severe obesity, which would mean a BMI of 35 or more with an obesity-related condition like diabetes or a BMI of 40.\n\nAbout the ASMBSThe ASMBS is the largest organization for bariatric surgeons in the nation. It is a non-profit organization that works to advance the art and science of bariatric surgery and is committed to educating medical professionals and the lay public about bariatric surgery as an option for the treatment of morbid obesity, as well as the associated risks and benefits. It encourages its members to investigate and discover new advances in bariatric surgery, while maintaining a steady exchange of experiences and ideas that may lead to improved surgical outcomes for morbidly obese patients.

Screenshot from FDA recently approved medical devices web page.
This news release about a weight loss device recently approved by the FDA provides a basic description of the results of a trial, but doesn’t put them into context. The Obalon intragastric balloon is very similar to other inflatable balloons that are placed in the stomachs of patients with obesity to help them limit food intake temporarily while they try to change their diets and lifestyle. The release fails to clearly explain that the main difference between the Obalon device and other balloons is that patients are not sedated during insertion. The release does not make clear that since the trial did not compare this device to others, there is no evidence about the relative performance of this product. The release does not tell readers that the manufacturer sponsored the trial. It does not point out that this sort of conference presentation is not put through the peer review process of a journal article.
A HealthDay story on the device, also reviewed by HealthNewsReview.org, provided some details not found in the news release, including a mention that the results are preliminary and have not yet been peer reviewed and a brief discussion of harms. However, neither the news release or the news story shared that the study was sponsored by the device manufacturer.

And nitrites help open blood vessels in the body, increasing blood flow and oxygen to places lacking in oxygen.\n\nNov. 3, 2010 -- Drinking beet juice increases blood flow to the brain in older people, a finding that suggests the dark red vegetable may fight the progression of dementia , a new study shows.\n\nBlood Flow to the Brain\n\n“There have been several very high-profile studies showing that drinking beet juice can lower blood pressure, but we wanted to show that drinking beet juice also increases perfusion, or blood flow, to the brain,” Daniel Kim-Shapiro, PhD, director of the Translational Science Center at Wake Forest University, says in a news release. “There are areas in the brain that become poorly perfused as you age, and that’s believed to be associated with dementia and poor cognition.”\n\nResearchers from the Translational Science Center looked at how dietary nitrates affected 14 adults aged 70 and older over a four-day period. On day one, subjects reported to a laboratory after a 10-hour fast, completed a health status report, and had either a high- or low-nitrate breakfast. The high-nitrate breakfast included 16 ounces of beet juice.\n\nThen they were sent home with lunch, dinner, and snacks that conformed to their assigned diets.\n\nOn the second day, after another 10-hour fast, the participants returned to the lab and ate their assigned breakfasts.

Regenexx involves harvesting a patient’s cells from bone marrow, growing more in a lab and then injecting the tissue-repairing cells into damaged joints or even lumbar discs.\n\nKaye is one of 500 patients who, since 2006, have paid several thousand dollars for a chance to regain their youthful bounce with Centeno’s stem-cell therapy.\n\nIn Kaye’s case, the treatment ended years of pain that five orthopedists said could be fixed only by fusing his ankle.\n\nToday, three years after his stem-cell treatment, Kaye says he plays golf “whenever it’s sunny.”\n\n“I can walk anywhere now,” said Kaye, who hasn’t used a cane since his Regenexx treatment. “It’s been an incredible recovery.”\n\nBut the FDA says stem cells are really a type of drug that requires intensive study and licensing.\n\nThe agency sent Centeno a letter in 2008 warning him that lack of FDA licensing for Regenexx appeared to be in violation of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA asked Centeno to write a letter detailing “steps you have taken or will take to address the violations.”\n\nCenteno, 46, sent a response to the FDA but said he has yet to receive a formal reply.\n\nCenteno asserts that a person’s own stem cells, which he magnifies in a culture of the patient’s own blood in a controlled lab, are not a drug.\n\nDealing with the FDA\n\nWhile Centeno circumvents the FDA, at least one other company is working with the agency to treat adults with their own stem cells.\n\nIn Louisiana, the 4-year-old TCA Cellular Therapy company has several ongoing FDA-approved clinical trials on humans, using patients’ own stem cells to treat heart and vascular diseases. The company is waiting for FDA review of its plan for clinical trials using stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS, known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.\n\nCenteno insists that the FDA exceeded its authority when, in an effort to prevent the spread of disease, it decided in 2005 that a patient’s own stem cells should be regulated as if they were being used on another human.\n\nBut the medical community largely has supported the change.\n\nAn October 2006 report in the New England Journal of Medicine analyzed the FDA’s updated regulation of stem-cell-based therapies. The report said researchers should be able to prove stem cells used won’t transmit disease and will be pure, effective and safe. The authors concluded existing regulations governing stem cells “provide an appropriate structure for ensuring the safety and efficacy of the next generation of stem-cell-based products.”\n\nThe International Cellular Medicine Society, which Centeno helped establish to set professional guidelines for adult stem-cell therapies and now counts 300 physicians in its ranks, is meeting this month with the FDA to discuss the issue of whether a patient’s own cells classify as a regulated drug.\n\nA hard-line stance by the FDA could force Centeno to go abroad with his Regenexx procedure, which he licenses to other doctors. Already he is helping to open a Regenexx clinic in an orthopedic hospital in China that specializes in medical tourism and caters to patients seeking unconventional medical treatment.\n\nHarvesting, cultivating and three injections of stem cells at Centeno’s clinic costs $8,000 and is not covered by most insurance policies.\n\nCenteno’s treatment, three 10-minute injections, can flood an area with as many as 40 million stem cells — roughly the size of a pea. By comparison, microfracture, a surgical technique that involves creating tiny breaks in a bone, bathes an injured joint in a few hundred thousand stem cells.\n\n“The body sometimes has a hard time getting enough stem cells to an area, and what we do is simply amplify the number of cells,” Centeno said.\n\nPaul Pendleton is certain that adult stem-cell therapy could someday end joint-replacement surgery. He says it already saved him from replacing his knee.\n\nHe was about to give up decades of weightlifting and regular workouts when he found Centeno a year ago.\n\n“It feels like my knee did 20 years ago. I’m back doing lunges, teaching my spinning classes,” said the 53-year-old petroleum engineer. “The knee seems kind of bulletproof to me. It was a solution that conventional medicine could not offer.”\n\nSoon, regenerative stem-cell therapies like Centeno’s may not be so cutting edge. A study published last month in the peer-reviewed journal Current Stem Cell Research and Therapy detailed the recovery of 227 Centeno patients. Using high-resolution MRIs, the study showed no patients developed tumors or other serious complications from the treatment.\n\n“The safety has been quite good,” Centeno said. “Especially when compared to other things like knee replacement or a big orthopedic surgery or microfracture or a laminectomy, the risk profile of this is far less than all of them.”\n\nAddressing safety issues\n\nAs doctors and researchers present more stem-cell therapies to the FDA, the regulatory process may move more quickly, said Dennis Roop, director of the new Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Biology at the University of Colorado Denver’s An schutz Medical Campus.\n\n“But it will not ever evolve to the point where you don’t have to address the safety issues,” said Roop, noting that the FDA strictly regulates labs where tissues are grown. “If any physician thinks he can take cells out, expand them and grow them in his own clinic, the risk is something very similar to gene therapy, where there was so much hype and an adverse event can stymie the field for years.”\n\nIn 2007, a 36-year-old Chicago woman died three weeks after her knee was injected with genetically engineered viruses as part of an investigational treatment researching gene therapy’s potential in easing the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nWhile the culture and climate for stem-cell therapies is improving, Roop said, more research, like Colorado State University’s stem-cell work on dogs and horses, is needed to ensure safety and learn long-term effects of stem-cell therapies.\n\n“I think as more data accumulates documenting safety, that will potentially accelerate getting more of these stem-cell therapies approved,” he said.\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374 or jblevins@denverpost.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Story feels like a formulaic David and Goliath story:  local entrepeneur feels FDA’s ""pinch.""  But the story includes absolutely no data about the entrepeneur’s claims.  </span>","The story provides some key points from both sides of the debate and some caveats.

But for others, doctors may prescribe a more invasive treatment that involves injecting hyaluronic acid in to the knee, called viscosupplementation.\n\nNow, a new report questions the efficacy of this treatment for osteoarthritis in the knee.\n\nHyaluronic acid is a lubricating fluid that is naturally found in the knee, but degenerates over time in people with osteoarthritis. The effect of the injection used in viscosupplementation is to stimulate cells in the knee to increase production of hyaluronic acid.\n\n\n\nIn a meta-analysis of 177 reports that included data on more than 12,000 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee, researchers at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland concluded that the treatment ""has minimal benefits and potential for harm.""\n\nThey write that ""because of increased risks for serious adverse events and local adverse events, the administration of these preparations should be discouraged.""\n\nDr. John Richmond disagrees. He is the Chairman of the Orthopedics Department at New England Baptist Hospital and the previous Chair of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) working group on treatment of osteoarthritis in knees.\n\n""We have an epidemic of osteoarthritis of the knee and we have limited treatment options,"" says Dr. Richmond, who was not affiliated with the analysis but who reviewed the same data it was based on. ""This needs to remain one of those limited treatment options and should be used appropriately by the physician giving it.""\n\nThe most common side effects patients undergoing viscosupplementation may endure are flare-ups - where the knee becomes hot and swollen within 24 hours after the injection - and effusions, where excessive joint fluid collects inside the knee. The researchers in Switzerland reviewed the existing studies and concluded that viscosupplementation was associated with an increase in these and other adverse events.\n\nDr. Richmond, who has independently reviewed the same research when the AAOS was drafting their recommendations to treat osteoarthritis of the knee, argues that despite infrequent instances of those side-effects, viscosupplementation remains a solid treatment choice for some patients.\n\n""This is most effective in relatively younger patients, 40 to 50 to 60 year olds, and...in people with mild to moderate forms of the disease,"" says Richmond. ""This is not a first line treatment, but it\'s a reasonable treatment in those people who have been appropriately screened.""\n\nThe authors of the study discourage patients from getting this treatment. However, Richmond says patients considering viscosupplementation should discuss this as a treatment option with their doctor.']","This is a shallow piece of journalism.  Cite a large meta-analysis – but don’t quote any of the researchers.  Yet turn the story over to one US critic, who doesn’t cite any evidence.  Huh?","This is he-said-she-said health care journalism that applies no critical analysis and is not helpful for readers.

The pilot study published today in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.\n\nThe eight-week clinical trial involved 30 otherwise healthy adults with moderate to severe restless leg syndrome. Researchers studied Clinical Global Impression responses as well as the mean change in the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group Study Scale (IRLSSGS). A meta-analysis was then used to compare the RLS device with three historic studies of the medication ropinirole and a placebo.\n\nClinical Global Impression responses indicated significantly greater improvement with the RLS device (90 percent) compared with ropinirole (63 percent), the current standard dopamine therapy for RLS. Additionally, change in IRLSSGS score was significantly greater for the RLS device (17.22) compared to historic reports for ropinirole versus the placebo (12 versus 8.9 respectively). Patients using the RLS device also reported an 82 percent decrease in sleep loss.\n\nThe RLS device was designed to put adjustable targeted pressure on two muscles in the foot known to relax symptoms of RLS, the abductor hallucis and the flexor hallucis brevis. Researchers indicate that the pressure produced by the device may also stimulate a dopamine release, similar to massage therapy or acupressure.\n\n""By putting pressure on specific muscles in the feet, we are able to create a response in the brain that relaxes the muscles activated during RLS,"" said Phyllis Kuhn, MS, PhD, and the study\'s lead researcher. ""It\'s a near perfect example of the body regulating itself without drugs, many of which have the potential for significant adverse side effects.""\n\nRestless leg syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic disorder causing unpleasant sensations and an urge to move the legs when at rest. The sleep loss associated with RLS can cause extreme fatigue, anxiety and depression. According to the National Institute of Health, RLS may affect as many as 10 percent of the U.S. population, with more than nine million experiencing moderate to severe symptoms.\n\nUntil recently, potent drugs including opioids, depressants and dopamine agonists have been used to ease symptoms, but each of these is accompanied by negative side effects such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting and the added risk of addiction.\n\n""Restless legs syndrome really erodes quality of life because it causes extreme fatigue for many patients. As an osteopathic physician, it\'s a challenge to balance the need to restore sleep while preventing additional harm from medication. These results show promise in otherwise healthy individuals for a nonpharmaceutical option that appears to have rather minor, temporary adverse effects for some users,"" said Rob Danoff, DO, an osteopathic family physician and program at Aria Health Care in Philadelphia.\n\nAdverse effects were reported by seven patients in the study. The effects included pain (1), pins and needles sensation (2), irritability (3), spasm (1) and warm feet (1).\n\n###\n\nOpen access to the full review is available until September 1, 2016: http://jaoa. org/ article. aspx?articleid= 2531565 .\n\nDisclosures: Dr Kuhn worked without compensation through Lake Erie Research Institute (LERI) during the 5 years of the study of the device and is now receiving compensation for that work.

While the study was just published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, the results were submitted to the FDA more than five years ago and the key findings have been used to market the device that was cleared for sale in 2013. Besides omitting the history of the study, the release promotes this foot wrap as if it were the only alternative to drug treatment, when there are other devices also on the market, as well as recommendations for massage, hot baths, lifestyle changes and other ways people can try to control bothersome leg movements.
The release would have been stronger had it noted that the device is already on the market, and at what cost. More details on the trial results, including limitations, as found in the published study, would also have been useful.

But recently emerging research suggests vitamin D deficiency could also be a contributing factor of obesity.\n\nThe World Health Organization describes childhood obesity as one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century, with an estimated 41 million children under the age of five falling into this category. Obesity puts children at greater risk of developing preventable conditions like heart disease and diabetes at a younger age, and suffering poor health later in life.\n\nGetty Images\n\nRead more: Household cleaning products might be making your children fat\n\nIn what is believed to be the first study to investigate the links between vitamin D supplementation and the weight and health of obese children and adolescents, researchers from University of Athens Medical School and Aghia Sophia Children\'s Hospital, Athens, recruited 232 particpants.\n\nThe team measured participants\' vitamin D levels, body fat percentage, as well as their markers of liver and heart function at the start of the study, and again 12 months later.\n\nThe researchers randomly assigned 117 children with supplements containing 50,000 IU vitamin D for six weeks, while the others acted as the control group.\n\nChildren who took vitamin D had a significantly lower BMI, the researchers found. They also had lower body fat, as well as healthier cholesterol levels.\n\nDr. Evangelia, associate professor pediatric and adolescent endocrinology at at the Medical School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and lead author of the study, said: ""These findings suggest that simple vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of overweight and obese children developing serious heart and metabolic complications in later life.”\n\nThe findings are set to be presented at the 57th Annual European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology Meeting, and have therefore not yet been reviewed.\n\nIn their next investigation, the team will study whether vitamin D supplements can improve the health of obese children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with disorders linked to obesity, such as high cholesterol, high blood sugar levels, and high blood pressure.\n\n""Although these initial findings indicate that vitamin D could be used in the treatment of obesity, there remains a lack of evidence on the safety and long-term effects of supplementation, particularly if there is no vitamin D deficiency,” said Charmandari. ""However, if your child is overweight or obese I recommend that you consult your primary care physician for advice, and consider having their vitamin D levels tested.""\n\nProfessor Mary Fewtrell, assistant officer for health promotion at the U.K.-based Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, told Newsweek: ""Although the effect sizes are not given, these outcomes are certainly positive. It\'s encouraging that a simple intervention could have these effects and this certainly merits further investigation to consider its potential impacts on vitamin D supplementation for children with obesity.""\n\nEarlier this year, researchers in the Netherlands published a study indicating higher levels of belly fat are linked to lower vitamin D levels.\n\nAccording to findings presented at the European Society of Endocrinology annual meeting in Barcelona, individuals with higher levels of total body and abdominal fat appeared to have lower levels of vitamin D.\n\nRachida Rafiq, the lead author of the study told Newsweek at the time: ""Our results are significant as vitamin D deficiency and obesity are very common problems in our society nowadays,"" she told Newsweek, and argued that it is an important potential relationship to explore.\n\n""Future studies should explore what the underlying mechanisms are that explain this specific relationship between vitamin D and visceral adipose tissue.""']","Media outlets must be careful in covering rudimentary results, since they may never be published or peer-reviewed.","Newsweek covers the results of a preliminary study that suggest a weekly dose of vitamin D might help children with obesity.
While the story provides important context to the issue, identifies some caveats, and includes the voice of an outside expert, some key details weren’t included.

It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.\n\nOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.\n\nThe impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a “public health emergency”.\n\nBut the government’s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.\n\nVehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.\n\nAction to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.\n\n“It is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,” said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. “It supports the natural barrier.”\n\nWhen inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: “Damage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.”\n\nThe inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.\n\nEctoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of £17 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.\n\nBilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: “Especially in Asia – China in particular – the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.”\n\nThe protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.\n\n“The point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established – there is no more doubt,” Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: “Personally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.”\n\nDr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: “Ectoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.”\n\n“The work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,” he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. “It could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.”\n\nKrutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. “It is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution]. The best thing is that we have clean air because then we don’t need any prophylactic treatment. But on the other hand we have to be realistic and in many countries you cannot just switch traffic overnight to electric cars and do other drastic things.”\n\n“It will take many more years, especially in countries like China, and I think there is an ethical need to provide something to the general population to protect them,” he said.']",The story hints at evidence but provides no substantiation of the claims made by the sources in the story.,"This is a romp through a field of unsubstantiated claims on the benefits and promise of a new device that purports to protect the body from air pollution-induced illnesses.

Seven randomized trials with zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges found that the duration of colds was shortened on average by 33%.\n\nZinc lozenges appear to influence the common cold through the release of free zinc ions into the oro-pharyngeal region. However, zinc ions can bind tightly to various chemical complexes in such a way that little or no free zinc ions are released. Previously zinc lozenges containing citric acid were shown to be ineffective in treating colds because citric acid binds zinc ions very tightly and no free zinc is released.\n\nZinc acetate has been proposed as the most ideal salt for zinc lozenges since acetate binds to zinc ions very weakly. Zinc gluconate is another salt that has been frequently used in zinc lozenges. However, gluconate binds the zinc ion more tightly than acetate does. Because of the somewhat stronger binding, zinc gluconate has been proposed to be less suitable constituent for lozenges. Although the binding difference between zinc acetate and zinc gluconate is a fact, it is not evident whether that causes significant differences at the clinical level for treating the common cold.\n\nIn the meta-analysis, Dr. Harri Hemilä from the University of Helsinki, Finland, collected randomized trials on zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges and compared their observed efficacies. Three trials had used zinc acetate lozenges and found that colds were shortened on average by 40%. Four trials had used zinc gluconate lozenges and colds were shortened on average by 28%. The 12% difference between the average effects of the two kinds of lozenges was explained purely by random variation. Furthermore, one of the zinc gluconate lozenge trials was an outlier inconsistent with all the other six zinc lozenge trials. If that outlier trial was excluded, the difference between the three zinc acetate and the three zinc gluconate trials shrinked to just 2%, i.e., a 40% vs. 38% reduction in common cold duration. Thus, properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges.\n\nDr. Hemilä also analyzed the dose response relationship between the elemental zinc dose and the observed efficacy in reducing common cold duration. There was no difference in the efficacy between five trials that used 80 to 92 mg of zinc per day and the two trials that used 192 and 207 mg of zinc per day. Thus, zinc doses of over 100 mg per day do not seem to provide any more benefit.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hemilä, there is no justification for the popular phrase that ""there is no cure for the common cold"" because of the strong evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten common cold duration by over 30%. However, in future studies the optimal composition of zinc lozenges should be investigated. The optimum frequency of their administration also warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, he also considers that ""the current evidence of efficacy for zinc lozenges is so strong that common cold patients should be encouraged to try them for treating their colds, but the patients should ascertain that the lozenges do not contain citric acid or its salt citrate.""\n\n###']","The news release meticulously reports the study findings, but doesn’t provide any information about alternatives and disadvantages of using zinc to treat the common cold.","This news release describes results of a meta-analysis of seven studies on the use of zinc lozenges for shortening the duration of common colds. The study compared the effectiveness of two kinds of zinc salt in lozenges: zinc acetate and zinc gluconate. Although the studies with zinc acetate lozenges shortened colds more than those with zinc gluconate lozenges, the difference wasn’t large enough to be statistically significant.
Researchers also compared the effectiveness of various doses of zinc in the lozenges and found that five trials that used low doses of 85 to 92 mg per day were just as effective as trials that used 192 to 207 mg per day. The conclusion of the study was that zinc lozenges do shorten the length of the common cold, but more studies are needed to confirm optimal ingredients of lozenges and the ideal dosage.
The news release is meticulous about accuracy in reporting the study findings, but doesn’t provide any information about when zinc should be taken, the actual benefit in terms of days shaved off from suffering cold symptoms, and alternatives and disadvantages of using zinc to treat the common cold.

Rush began offering SAVI SCOUT, which has been used in more than 50 lumpectomy surgeries, in July.\n\nSAVI SCOUT allows a radiologist to insert a radar wave reflector the size of a grain of rice in the patient’s breast up to 30 days before surgery to mark the location of the lesion, as shown with ultrasound or X-ray mammography. The reflector replaces the widespread current practice of inserting a thin, hooked wire into the breast the same day as surgery.\n\n“When there is an abnormality that we can’t feel and are unable to biopsy, we have to find that lesion in surgery,” said Dr. Andrea Madrigrano, assistant professor of surgery at Rush University Medical Center.\n\nSAVI SCOUT replaces a more inconvenient technique used since '70s\n\nUsed since the 1970s, a hooked wire is placed in the breast through the skin to the abnormality using ultrasound or X-ray guidance with local anesthesia. The wire is placed into the breast to help guide the surgeon in removing the abnormality later that day.\n\n“Until now, a patient would go to the imaging center to have the thin wire precisely placed in the breast. The woman would then be taken to the operating room area,” Madrigrano said.\n\nWire localization requires a high degree of coordination between radiology and surgical scheduling, which can lead to delays between placement of the wire and surgery, often requiring a woman to wait long periods of time with the wire in her breast.\n\n“Before surgery, these patients are in a hospital gown and are walking around while this wire is in place, which obviously is less than ideal for the patient,” Madrigrano said.\n\n“The radar reflector is a replacement for the wire and is essentially a little marker. After the patient receives a local anesthetic, it can be placed into the breast using an extremely thin needle under image guidance days or weeks prior to surgery. Because this important step is out of the way in advance, it completely changes the patient’s day of surgery experience.”\n\nRadar can target abnormality within 1 mm, sparing more healthy tissue\n\nUnlike mastectomy, which treats breast cancer by removing an entire breast, lumpectomy surgery — also known as breast-conserving surgery — is used to remove only the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding the tumor. Using the SAVI SCOUT system technology, which emits 50 million radar pulses per second, surgeons can target the affected tissue within 1 millimeter of the reflector.\n\n“When Madrigrano told me about it, I thought it was an ingenious idea and I’m glad it was developed,” said Nancy Morrissey, who underwent lumpectomy surgery at Rush in July using the SAVI SCOUT technology. “It made surgery go smoothly, and I didn’t have any pain before or after.\n\n“When the marker was inserted near the lump, it was similar to a biopsy. I was glad it was done a week before and not the same day as the lumpectomy surgery. I have been very impressed with the experience.” According to Cianna Medical, the company that created SAVI SCOUT, 70 percent of women return to work the next day after the SCOUT procedure.\n\nIn addition to enhancing the patient’s surgical experience, the more precise localization of the surgical site enable surgeons to plan the procedure better. That advantage may lead to less tissue needing to be removed and a better appearance of the breast after surgery.\n\n“Ultimately, this wireless technology has the potential to reduce surgical delays, and more importantly will benefit patients by increasing comfort and satisfaction during a stressful time,” Madrigrano said.""]","To the average reader, this device seems like a win-win for patients and medical institutions. Why not close the deal with some useful facts?","This news release claims a newer procedure called the Savi Scout device which uses radar to locate and mark a tumor in the breast prior to surgery has many advantages over the traditional procedure that uses a hook wire — but offers not a single concrete example. The availability of the new localizing technology may be an important step forward for patients as well as for institutions, but we need evidence in addition to positive marketing copy.
No numbers are provided to back up the claims despite the fact that there is a limited amount of information available about the device on the manufacturer’s website that could be referenced. In an entry on ClinicalTrials.gov, the manufacturer informs that the device is currently being tested for long-term (beyond 30 days) placement prior to surgery, and that the FDA cleared the device for commercial sales in August 2014. Under the approval, the manufacturer was not required to conduct clinical trials to prove the device’s safety and effectiveness.

When added to the benefit from the first five years of use, a decade of tamoxifen can cut breast cancer mortality in half during the second decade after diagnosis, researchers estimate.\n\nSome women balk at taking a preventive drug for so long, but for those at high risk of a recurrence, ""this will be a convincer that they should continue,"" said Dr. Peter Ravdin, director of the breast cancer program at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio.\n\nHe reviewed results of the study, which was being presented Wednesday at a breast cancer conference in San Antonio and published by the British medical journal Lancet.\n\n""The result of this trial will have a major, immediate impact on premenopausal women,"" Ravdin said.\n\nAbout 50,000 of the roughly 230,000 new cases of breast cancer in the United States each year occur in women before menopause. Most breast cancers are fueled by estrogen, and hormone blockers are known to cut the risk of recurrence in such cases.\n\nTamoxifen long was the top choice, but newer drugs called aromatase inhibitors—sold as Arimidex, Femara, Aromasin and in generic form—do the job with less risk of causing uterine cancer and other problems.\n\nBut the newer drugs don\'t work well before menopause. Even some women past menopause choose tamoxifen over the newer drugs, which cost more and have different side effects such as joint pain, bone loss and sexual problems.\n\nThe new study aimed to see whether over a very long time, longer treatment with tamoxifen could help.\n\nDr. Christina Davies of the University of Oxford in England and other researchers assigned 6,846 women who already had taken tamoxifen for five years to either stay on it or take dummy pills for another five years.\n\nResearchers saw little difference in the groups five to nine years after diagnosis. But beyond that time, 15 percent of women who had stopped taking tamoxifen after five years had died of breast cancer versus 12 percent of those who took it for 10 years. Cancer had returned in 25 percent of women on the shorter treatment versus 21 percent of those treated longer.\n\nTamoxifen had some troubling side effects: Longer use nearly doubled the risk of endometrial cancer. But it rarely proved fatal, and there was no increased risk among premenopausal women in the study—the very group tamoxifen helps most.\n\n""Overall the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,"" Dr. Trevor Powles of the Cancer Centre London wrote in an editorial published with the study.\n\nThe study was sponsored by cancer research organizations in Britain and Europe, the United States Army, and AstraZeneca PLC, which makes Nolvadex, a brand of tamoxifen, which also is sold as a generic for 10 to 50 cents a day. Brand-name versions of the newer hormone blockers, aromatase inhibitors, are $300 or more per month, but generics are available for much less.\n\nThe results pose a quandary for breast cancer patients past menopause and those who become menopausal because of their treatment—the vast majority of cases. Previous studies found that starting on one of the newer hormone blockers led to fewer relapses than initial treatment with tamoxifen did.\n\nAnother study found that switching to one of the new drugs after five years of tamoxifen cut the risk of breast cancer recurrence nearly in half—more than what was seen in the new study of 10 years of tamoxifen.\n\n""For postmenopausal women, the data still remain much stronger at this point for a switch to an aromatase inhibitor,"" said that study\'s leader, Dr. Paul Goss of Massachusetts General Hospital. He has been a paid speaker for a company that makes one of those drugs.\n\nWomen in his study have not been followed long enough to see whether switching cuts deaths from breast cancer, as 10 years of tamoxifen did. Results are expected in about a year.\n\nThe cancer conference is sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research, Baylor College of Medicine and the UT Health Science Center.\n\n———\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP']","Solid story, better than the competing ","The USA Today story was actually a bit longer than the Associated Press story, so this was not a matter of word count limitations.  In the end, it was a matter of which words were used and how the space was allocated.  But the New York Times story was longest of the three – more than 1,000 words – and put that additional space to good use.

Teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years.\n\nThe Lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry\'s journal, Chemical Science.\n\nUntil now, scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic (or positively charged) amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a \'side chain\'. This meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin, called enduracididine, or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs.\n\nEach amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactin\'s structure, and the Lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine - which holds position ten - with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged. These amino acids lack the \'binding\' part, over-turning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to so-called \'target binding\' to be highly potent against superbugs.\n\nWith this new knowledge, synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed, taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step - a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug. Importantly, the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin.\n\nDr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln\'s School of Pharmacy, is leading the research team. He explained: ""When teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA. We have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as MRSA.\n\n""This simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level. Enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity, a complex multistep synthesis, and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields.\n\n""We needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development. We had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up, but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin. Now, we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different, and are commercially-available. They are also 16 times more potent than a clinically-used antibiotic in killing the superbug MRSA, and they were also highly potent against other antibiotic-resistant infections, such as vancomycin resistant enterococci, and tuberculosis.""\n\nThe work builds on the success of the team\'s pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months. Dr Singh is working with colleagues from the School of Life Sciences and the School of Chemistry at the University of Lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug.\n\nIt has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year. The development of new antibiotics which can be used as a last resort when other drugs are ineffective is therefore a crucial area of study for healthcare researchers around the world.\n\n###']","This study may be of great interest to drug researchers, but its relevance to practicing clinicians and the general public remains unknown.","New antibiotics are desperately needed, but an advance in the synthesis of a new antibiotic should not be called a breakthrough when the drug has yet to be tested in people. This release neglects to tell readers that all the claims are based on only laboratory tests. There is little acknowledgment of the uncertainties and challenges ahead.

MorNuCo Laboratories is elated to share these results with the public, as early detection is widely considered the corner stone of an effective strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths.\n\nMalignant mesothelioma is an aggressive and almost uniformly fatal tumor caused primarily by exposure to asbestos. In this study, the serum presence of a mesothelioma-specific form of the ENOX2 protein (a recently identified marker of malignancy) was found within the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals an average of 6.2 years in advance of clinical symptoms by using the ONCOblot tissue of origin cancer detection test.\n\nSerum samples that were collected from asbestos-exposed individuals prior to the development of mesothelioma as part of a cancer surveillance program were tested for ENOX2 protein presence to determine how long in advance of clinical symptoms that the mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants could be detected.\n\nThe results of this study showed that two mesothelioma-specific ENOX2 protein transcript variants were detected in the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals 4-10 years prior to clinical diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, an exciting sign of progress in the cancer detection field.\n\n""The completion of this trial is an exciting new chapter for our work,"" says Nick Miner, Vice President of Business Development. ""Although asbestos-induced mesothelioma is a very specific example of early detection, we are currently pursuing larger-scale clinical trials to investigate the utility of the ENOX2 protein marker to predict the onset of cancers of other tissues of origin as well.""

(Jan. 2, 2018) - In just four months, high-doses of vitamin D reduce arterial stiffness in young, overweight/obese, vitamin-deficient, but otherwise still healthy African-Americans, researchers say.\n\nRigid artery walls are an independent predictor of cardiovascular- related disease and death and vitamin D deficiency appears to be a contributor, says Dr. Yanbin Dong, geneticist and cardiologist at the Georgia Prevention Institute at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.\n\nSo researchers looked at baseline and again 16 weeks later in 70 African-Americans ages 13-45 - all of whom had some degree of arterial stiffness - taking varying doses of the vitamin best known for its role in bone health.\n\nIn what appears to be the first randomized trial of its kind, they found that arterial stiffness was improved by vitamin D supplementation in a dose-response manner in this population, they write in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOverweight/obese blacks are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency because darker skin absorbs less sunlight - the skin makes vitamin D in response to sun exposure - and fat tends to sequester vitamin D for no apparent purpose, says Dong, the study\'s corresponding author.\n\nParticipants taking 4,000 international units - more than six times the daily 600 IUs the Institute of Medicine currently recommends for most adults and children - received the most benefit, says Dr. Anas Raed, research resident in the MCG Department of Medicine and the study\'s first author.\n\nThe dose, now considered the highest, safe upper dose of the vitamin by the Institute of Medicine, reduced arterial stiffness the most and the fastest: 10.4 percent in four months. ""It significantly and rapidly reduced stiffness,"" Raed says.\n\nTwo thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe. At 600 IUs, arterial stiffness actually increased slightly - .1 percent - and the placebo group experienced a 2.3 percent increase in arterial stiffness over the timeframe.\n\nThey used the non-invasive, gold standard pulse wave velocity to assess arterial stiffness. Reported measures were from the carotid artery in the neck to the femoral artery, a major blood vessel, which supplies the lower body with blood. The American Heart Association considers this the primary outcome measurement of arterial stiffness.\n\nWhen the heart beats, it generates a waveform, and with a healthy heart and vasculature there are fewer and smaller waves. The test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving, and in this case, fast is not good, Raed says.\n\n""When your arteries are more stiff, you have higher pulse wave velocity, which increases your risk of cardiometabolic disease in the future,"" says Raed.\n\nThe varying doses, as well as the placebo participants took, were all packaged the same so neither they or the investigators knew which dose, if any, they were getting until the study was complete. Both placebo and supplements were given once monthly - rather than daily at home - at the GPI to ensure consistent compliance.\n\nDong was also corresponding author on a study published in 2015 in the journal BioMed Central Obesity that showed, in this same group of individuals, both 2,000 and 4,000 IUs restored more desirable vitamin D blood levels of 30 nanograms per milliliter.\n\nThe 4,000 upper-limit dose restored healthy blood level quicker - by eight weeks - and was also better at suppressing parathyroid hormone, which works against vitamin D\'s efforts to improve bone health by absorbing calcium, they reported.\n\nWhile heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and death than whites and the disease tends to occur earlier in life. The authors write that arterial stiffness and vitamin D deficiency might be potential contributors.\n\nWhile just how vitamin D is good for our arteries isn\'t completely understood, it appears to impact blood vessel health in many ways. Laboratory studies have shown that mice missing a vitamin D receptor have higher activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, says Raed. Activation of this system increases blood vessel constriction, which can contribute to arterial stiffness. Vitamin D also can suppress vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, activation of garbage-eating macrophages and calcification formation, all of which can thicken blood vessel walls and hinder flexibility. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease, says Raed.\n\nNow it\'s time to do a larger-scale study, particularly in high-risk populations, and follow participants\' progress for longer periods, Dong and Raed say. ""A year would give us even more data and ideas,"" Raed adds.\n\nDong notes that pulse wave velocity and blood pressure measures are complimentary but not interchangeable. ""We think maybe in the future, when you go to your physician, he or she might check your arterial stiffness as another indicator of how healthy you are,"" Raed says.\n\nThere were no measurable differences in weight or blood pressure measurements over the 16-week study period.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine currently recommends a daily intake of 800 IUs of vitamin D for those age 70 and older. For adolescents and adults, they recommend 4,000 IUs as the upper daily limit; 2,000 was a previous upper limit.\n\nMore than 80 percent of Americans, the majority of whom spend their days indoors, have vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Dong, an expert in vitamin D and a professor in the MCG Department of Population Health Sciences, says about 15 minutes daily in the ""young"" sun - between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. - but before your skin starts to get pink, is the best source of vitamin D.\n\nFoods like milk, milk products like cheese and yogurt, fatty fish like mackerel and sardines, some greens like kale and collards and fortified cereals also are good sources. The researchers say a vitamin D supplement is an inexpensive and safe option for most of us.\n\n###']",This relatively careful release on a small vitamin D study skimps on just enough details to fall short.,"Getty Images
With just a few tweaks, this could have been a stellar release on a small study about the benefits of high doses of vitamin D on arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness is a cause of atherosclerosis, a  thickening and stiffening of the arterial wall, and is related to high blood pressure or hypertension.
The release presents many of the necessary caveats, avoids disease mongering and unjustifiable language, and does a nice job describing what the researchers did to reach their conclusions. The release also does readers a service by explaining a relatively complex topic in terms that regular readers (and journalists) can understand.
The actual number of people who saw a benefit is missing, though, as is any mention of harms, any mention of other treatments for arterial stiffness, and any mention of how the study was funded or whether there were any conflicts of interest. We gave the release three stars because we felt these were mostly benign omissions. But, in the interest of keeping a high standard for writing strong scientific news releases, we make note of the omissions where they occurred.

What’s more, the hormone, which was provided free by the manufacturer in the study, today costs $700 for a single shot, Baker said.\n\nAn expert who wasn’t involved in the research echoed the cautions.\n\n“I think it’s potentially good news, but I don’t think it’s to the point where people should go out and start using it,” said Dr. Ronald C. Petersen, who heads the Mayo Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nThe new study, published Monday in the Archives of Neurology, included 152 people aged 55 to 87. Sixty-six had “mild cognitive impairment,” which falls somewhere between normal forgetfulness and dementia.\n\nBaker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age.\n\nBut recent work by one of Baker’s co-authors hints that nasal sprays with the hormone insulin may have a positive impact on memory in people with Alzheimer’s disease - although that’s far from conclusive yet.\n\nGHRH, a hormone produced by the hypothalamus in the brain, is linked to the insulin system, but also has a host of other effects. It dwindles naturally with aging, which has been linked to declines in memory and executive function.\n\n“All you have to do is supplement that hormone and it then will result in a whole cascade of effects that then restore an aging system to a younger system,” said Baker.\n\nIn her study, people injected a synthetic version of GHRH or a placebo daily for five months. At the end, those who got the drug did better on psychological tests of executive function - whether or not they had mild cognitive impairment.\n\nIt’s unclear how the test differences will translate into real life, said Baker. One test, for instance, asked participants to name the color of a font - say, green - used to write the name of a different color - say, “red”. But Baker said people who got the hormone were more likely to report improvements in their ability to focus during the day.\n\nThe researchers found no serious side effects in the study, although people who got the hormone more often complained of symptoms like skin reactions and joint pain.\n\nStill, both Baker and Petersen said more work is needed to gauge the long-term consequences of GHRH injections. It’s possible health problems could show up down the road, and the mental boost may be short-lived.\n\n“Is it going to work in the long run and is it going to be safe? That is still unknown,” said Petersen.\n\nBaker added that it’s too early to say whether the hormone could play a role in thwarting the development of Alzheimer’s, which may affect as many as five million Americans.\n\nStill, she said, “There are things we can all do to postpone (mental) decline.” Keeping medical conditions such as diabetes under control and getting regular exercise are two examples.\n\n“We recommend commonly that people start exercising when they are having mild cognitive impairment,” Baker said. “Our work and others’ has shown that exercise really does make a difference.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/MNucEu Archives of Neurology, online August 6, 2012.']",Better than the competing ,"A good example of how to report on potentially promising new interventions while curbing enthusiasm with context and clearly-stated limitations.

And as the first tumor-killing virus to receive the FDA’s blessing, Imlygic could accelerate the development of other viral therapies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is huge for the whole field, and for cancer patients,” said John Bell, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. “The field is exploding, and this would be another arrow in the quiver that oncologists use.”\n\nImlygic is part of a new group of immune-stimulating viral therapies that could change how cancer is treated and managed. One involves a genetically tweaked poliovirus being tested in patients with brain tumors, while another, based on a version of the common cold virus, is now under evaluation in people with bladder cancer.\n\nMelanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer that kills around 10,000 people per year in the United States. In a trial of 436 patients with the disease, 16 percent of participants who received Imlygic saw their tumors shrink for at least six months, compared with just 2 percent of those who received an older immune-boosting drug. Among those whose cancer had spread locally but not to internal organs, the response rate was better — 33 percent.\n\n“It’s a low-toxicity treatment, and for the right patients you see quite stunning results,” said Robert Coffin, a virologist who created Imlygic at BioVex, the Woburn-based company he founded.\n\nIn 2011, the California biotech giant Amgen bought BioVex — and the rights to Imlygic, known generically as talimogene laherparepvec, or T-VEC — in a deal worth up to $1 billion. Amgen will charge patients $65,000 for a course of treatment, which analysts said is in line with expectations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“These days in oncology we’ve seen some prices quite a bit higher than that,” said Eric Schmidt, an analyst with Cowen & Company. “And Amgen’s not a company that likes to price gouge.”\n\nSchmidt said Imlygic’s market potential as a standalone drug is “very, very modest. It’s being developed in combination with other immunotherapies, where we think there’s a little more of a commercial opportunity, but we still need to see more data.”\n\nImlygic is approved for skin tumors that are inoperable in patients whose cancer has returned following surgery.\n\nSue Bohlin, a retired small-business owner in Farmingdale, N.J., is one of those patients. She received the viral therapy in early 2011 after conventional treatments failed to eliminate the skin tumors that had spread from her back to her breast.\n\n“The first time I took it, I got a really serious case of the chills and a high fever, but only for six or eight hours,” said Bohlin, now 62. “After that, there were no side effects.”\n\nSuch muted side effects point to a major benefit of this new approach, doctors and patients said. Aside from chills and fever, the other common symptom cited in the study was skin irritation.\n\nBohlin’s doctors planned to inject each of her tumor sites every two weeks, but after several rounds of treatments more tumors appeared. In a last-ditch effort meant to jump-start Bohlin’s immune system, they injected her on consecutive weeks. The tumors started shrinking in the following weeks, and about three months later they were gone.\n\n“I think we’re on the cusp of potentially curing patients” with these viruses and other immune therapies, said Dr. Howard Kaufman, chief surgical officer of the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and a lead researcher on Bohlin’s trial. “But short of that, this might be like diabetes, where we can control it and people live normal lives.”\n\nImlygic is based on a form of the herpes simplex virus that commonly causes cold sores. It is genetically altered to replicate only in tumor cells while also producing a protein that activates T-cells, the search-and-destroy specialists of the immune system. Those T-cells pick up melanoma cells’ molecular scent and hunt them down before going off in search of tumor cells hiding elsewhere in the body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This wakes up the immune system and says, ‘Hey! Active infection here, come check this out!’ ” said Dr. Antonio Chiocca, chairman of neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\n\nIn many of the newer experiments, researchers are combining cancer-killing viruses like Imlygic with other immune-activating agents known as checkpoint inhibitors. These therapies typically open gateways that tumors have used to block immune cells.\n\nIn one small study of 19 advanced melanoma patients treated with both Imlygic and a checkpoint inhibitor called Yervoy, nearly half of the patients responded. “It’s nothing short of dramatic,” said Dr. Jason Chesney, an oncologist at the University of Louisville, who is involved in running a larger, follow-up study of this combination approach.\n\nJohn O’Donnell, a retired math teacher in Piscataway, N.J., was one of those who tried the combination therapy, but ultimately responded only to Imlygic. More than 20 years ago, a dermatologist told him not to worry about the two tan, irregularly shaped spots near his clavicle. Three years ago, however, he noticed a small raised area on one of them.\n\nSurgeons removed the melanoma, but it returned last year under his arm and in his lung. O’Donnell, who is 67, started the combination therapy shortly thereafter, then stopped taking Yervoy after developing severe diarrhea, a common side effect of the treatment.\n\nBut he kept with the Imlygic, and the lung tumors soon disappeared. The nodule under his arm also grew small enough to be removed by surgery.\n\nThrough it all, O’Donnell remained healthy enough to achieve one of his primary goals: to continue to lead Tuesday Bingo night at a local senior center without the residents discovering his condition.\n\n“I know it sounds vain, but I’m too visible, and I’m too close to them,” he said. “They’re old and easily upset, and I can’t look sick.”\n\nEarlier this month, a new scan revealed shadows that could be signs of melanoma. “My doctor isn’t convinced, though, so she said we’ll just sit and wait,” O’Donnell said. “Even if it is something, there are other things to try.”\n\nMore from STAT:\n\n• Shocking events really can trigger heart problems\n\nAdvertisement\n\n• WHO advisers say first malaria vaccine needs more real-world study\n\n• Study says doctors passively discourage HPV vaccines\n\n• Sound waves improve intestinal drug absorption\n\nBob Tedeschi can be reached at tedeschi@statnews.com and on Twitter @bobtedeschi.

But we thought those resources could have been better deployed to provide some key information that the story lacks.,"The federal Food and Drug Administration has just approved a modified herpes simplex virus as a treatment for advanced-stage melanoma. The virus, which is designed to activate patients’ own immune systems, has been shown to shrink tumors for at least six months in patients who have run out of treatment options. This story does a nice job of explaining the way the virus works and offers readers reactions from a variety of scientists. Clearly a lot of legwork went into this story. But we were disappointed to see that none of these sources provided any critical evaluation of the research or pointed to any caveats — of which there are quite a few. In addition, while the piece’s patient stories don’t overdo the “good news” aspect of the treatment, we wished for more data and a more thorough discussion of the ultimate outcomes that matter to patients such as survival time.

The drugs affect different parts of the same signaling pathway. The FDA said the safety and efficacy of Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib were shown in a clinical study of 495 patients with previously untreated, advanced melanoma that demonstrate the BRAF V600 mutation. The government agency said that common side effects of the Cotellic and vemurafenib combination was diarrhea, sensitivity to ultraviolet light, nausea, fever and vomiting. Cotellic could also cause “severe” side effects including heart damage, new skin tumors, retinal detachment, skin rash, liver damage and hemorrhage. Cotellic has received orphan drug designation, for which the FDA has provided incentives that include quicker approval, tax benefits for the developer and seven years’ protection from competition after approval. Conventional drugs typically get five years protection. Orphan drugs are defined as experimental treatments for diseases with fewer than 200,000 patients at any one time. Cotellic and Zelboraf are both marketed by California-based Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Write to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\n\nCopyright ©2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The combination is reportedly going to be priced at $17,600 per month.

That’s what the findings of two new studies published this week suggest.\n\nIn the first study, published Monday in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, scientists found that men who took a daily dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) for five years had a 38% lower risk of developing prostate cancer, compared with other men. Additionally, daily acetaminophen was associated with a 51% reduced risk of developing an aggressive form of the disease. Men who took acetaminophen for less than five years saw no protective benefit.\n\n(More on TIME.com: Coffee Drinking Linked With Lower Risk of Fatal Prostate Cancer)\n\nPrevious research has shown that taking aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) every day may help reduce prostate cancer risk. The authors theorize that the same may be true of acetaminophen; while not an NSAID, it does have anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nFor the study, the researchers looked at data from 78,485 men who participated in the longitudinal Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, answering questions about diet and drug use every two years starting in 1992. During the follow-up, there were 8,092 cases of prostate cancer — significantly fewer in the group who took acetaminophen daily for five years.\n\nThe second study, published online Tuesday by Cancer Research, involved 1,455 men who had already been diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Harvard School of Public Health followed the men from 2004 to 2009 and found that those who engaged in regular brisk walking after diagnosis were significantly less likely to see their disease progress.\n\n(More on TIME.com: Study: Gay Men Are Twice as Likely to Have Cancer)\n\nMen who walked briskly — at a pace of about 3 miles per hour or faster — at least three hours per week were 57% less likely to experience disease progression (including elevated PSA levels, secondary treatment, bone metastasis or prostate cancer-related death), compared with men who walked less and more slowly.\n\n“The important point was the intensity of the activity,” Erin Richman, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF, said in a statement. “The walking had to be brisk for men to experience a benefit.”\n\nThe researchers said the effect of brisk walking persisted independent of age, diagnosis, type of treatment and characteristics of disease. The patients’ average age at diagnosis was 65. The findings are in line with previous research suggesting that physical activity may help reduce the risk of disease-related death in certain cases of prostate cancer.\n\n(More on TIME.com: Using Toenails to Predict Risk of Lung Cancer)\n\nWhy the association? MedPage Today reports:\n\nRichman and colleagues noted that the brisk walks may reduce insulin resistance, which decreases bioavailable insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and increases adiponectin levels, which are all associated with decreased risk of advanced or fatal prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Another potential source of the associated reduction was reduced inflammation due to a lower circulation of interleukin-6, high levels of which “predicted a 73% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer among normal-weight men,” the researchers wrote.\n\nProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 32,050 men died from prostate cancer in 2010 and 217,000 new cases were diagnosed. More than 2.2 million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">We understand the temptation to wrap two unrelated prostate cancer research findings into one neat little package.

Don’t Stop Your Statins,"['Taking statins the day of a coronary artery bypass operation may significantly improve survival, a study in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery found.\n\nResearchers looked at 3,021 heart surgery patients, most of whom were taking cholesterol-lowering statins. The 1,788 who continued statins up to the day of surgery had a risk of death within 30 days of 1.7 percent, compared with 2.9 percent for 452 who stopped one to three days before surgery, and 3.8 percent for 781 who did not take statins or stopped more than 72 hours before their operations.\n\nThe scientists had no data on how long patients had been taking statins, but only on when they stopped. After controlling for many preoperative health and behavioral characteristics, they found that compared with other patients, those who took statins on the day of surgery had a 48 percent reduced risk of dying in the next 30 days.\n\n“We already knew that people on statins before surgery had a decreased risk of death,” said a co-author, Dr. Yi Deng, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Baylor College of Medicine. “But there’s never before been data saying how harmful stopping shortly before surgery can be. Unless you have some other reason to stop them, you should take statins right up to the morning of surgery.”']",The story does not adequately address the quality of the evidence–and this is a major shortcoming considering the limitations.,"We can appreciate the push within a newsroom to hammer out a piece like this. Statins are popular, and heart surgeries are common. So a study that captures the intersection of both should have broad appeal to readers.
All the more reason, then, that news outlets should allow reporters to sink a little more time and space into a piece like this. There are interesting details to explore, but very few of them are covered in this four-paragraph piece. An outside expert source, for example, could have provided some perspective on the real-world reasons people stop taking a statin before surgery, and how this plays into what the study found.

A stool sample containing high levels of these markers will be strong enough to change the test\'s liquid display from pink to yellow, indicating high levels of Bifidobacterium. The liquid will remain pink if a sample has low levels of acetate and lactate, indicating that Bifidobacterium is missing and that key nutrients from breast milk, human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), are being wasted. Evivo has commenced rigorous clinical trials with the prototype to demonstrate the results from infant stool samples.\n\nPoint-of-Care Diagnostic Expert Turns Focus to the Infant Gut\n\nThe development of the prototype is led by Dr. Bethany Henrick, Ph.D., Director of Immunology and Diagnostics for Evivo. With more than a decade of experience designing and creating rapid, point-of-care diagnostics, Henrick was formerly an integral part of the team that developed and optimized the world\'s fastest point-of-care HIV test in 2005.\n\n""This is the first and only point-of-care screening test designed to identify infants that do not have enough Bifidobacterium levels to create a stable infant gut microbiome,"" said Dr. Henrick. ""With recent research indicating most babies born after 1980 do not acquire Bifidobacterium at birth, our ability to detect significant levels of Bifidobacterium gives pediatricians and parents an immediate indication of whether or not their baby has this beneficial gut bacteria that set them up for lifelong health.""\n\nIdentifying a Disappearing, Yet Critical Piece of Gut Health\n\nDr. Henrick\'s previously published findings, which are the basis for the Evivo test, show an inverse correlation between rising infant fecal pH, reduced acetate and lactate, and lower levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium, proving that the infant gut microbiome has been rapidly changing over the last three generations. In the past, babies acquired Bifidobacterium from their mother during childbirth, but due to the increased use of modern medical practices such as antibiotics, C-sections and formula feeding, nine out of 10 babies born in the U.S. today no longer acquire it. The generational loss of this good bacteria in the infant gut allows for potentially harmful bacteria such as E. Coli and Clostridia to thrive, which are linked to higher risk of short- and long-term health issues such as colic, eczema, allergies, diabetes, and obesity.\n\n""Currently there is no way to easily determine whether a baby is colonized with healthy bacteria,"" said Mark Underwood, M.D., Chief of Neonatology at UC Davis Medical Center. ""The ability to quickly measure levels of Bifidobacterium in a stool sample would enable pediatricians to identify babies with low levels of these beneficial bacteria and take appropriate action.""\n\nEvolve BioSystems\' Evivo is the only baby probiotic clinically proven to restore Bifidobacterium to a baby\'s gut and reduce potentially harmful bacteria by 80 percent. In a landmark clinical trial, Evivo produced rapid, substantial and persistent stabilization of the infant gut microbiome, to help set a foundation for life-long health.\n\nAbout Evolve BioSystems\n\nEvolve BioSystems, Inc. is a privately-held microbiome company dedicated to developing the next generation of products to establish, restore, and maintain a healthy gut microbiome.

Such microorganisms can break down indigestible molecules in a mother’s breast milk. There is also some limited evidence to suggest high levels of Bifidobacterium can improve an infant’s nutrition and health, and protect against “dangerous” bacteria in the gut that can cause issues late into life.
However, the release doesn’t explain how the test works, what its harms may or may not be, and how accurate it is or is not in showing there’s ample Bifidobacterium in a baby’s gut. The release also introduces an existing product, called Evivo probiotics, that a baby would take if a low level of Bifidobacterium was found — but does not describe the price, harms, effectiveness, and other important aspects of such a medical product.
There is no evidence provided about the test itself. Confoundingly, the release links to two studies that find correlations between Bifidobacterium levels and the incidences of certain health issues, yet states there is not yet any definitive, causal link between any of them. At best, publishing this release feels premature — more research, and a lot of it, is required. At worst, it’s a misleading and paper-thin marketing pitch to a future round of investors.

“Potential” and “preliminary” are key themes – yet they were never fully developed in the story. This is VERY preliminary work – so much so that its newsworthiness can be called into question.  But if this is going to be reported, it requires far more caveats than what this story delivered.

Which course of treatment – what combination of surgery, chemotherapy or radiation – will best help your child survive? But with most kids living long past their cancer diagnosis, it\'s also important to consider how treatments they undergo now may affect them later, even as adults.\n\nOne choice some parents may face is whether to seek a newer type of radiation called proton beam therapy, instead of conventional X-ray radiation, to potentially reduce harmful side effects in their developing child. Proton beam therapy is considered a big advance in cancer therapy by some experts. Others, however, hesitate to get caught up in the early hype without more long-term evidence. Even so, people are traveling far and wide so their children can receive proton therapy from the handful of centers where it\'s offered.\n\nFour leading radiation oncologists explained to U.S. News what parents should understand about proton therapy and its possible benefits:\n\nFewer side effects from cancer treatment is a major goal. (Courtesy of Mayo Clinic)\n\nProton beam therapy is a form of radiation that may reduce late side effects compared with conventional X-ray radiation. The pinpoint beam and lack of exit dose – which is unneeded radiation as the conventional X-ray beam passes beyond the tumor and through the body on its way out the other side – spares healthy, normal tissue in developing areas such as the brain, heart and lungs.\n\nChildhood brain cancer is considered one of the most evidence-based uses for proton therapy. It may prevent late effects such as hearing loss or reduced ability to do well in school. However, at least for now, proton therapy does not offer a higher possibility of cure than traditional X-ray radiation.\n\nThe brain is the most common area for kids to develop cancerous tumors that require radiation treatment, says Dr. Torunn Yock, director of pediatric radiation oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\n""Because the pediatric brain is still growing and developing, if you irradiate the brain during this process, it won\'t continue to grow and develop as it normally would,"" she says. ""And this over time leads to slowing of development, which shows up as drops in neurocognitive testing.""\n\nThe younger the child, the more potential exists for stunted development, Yock says. ""A 2-year-old is very different from a 15-year-old in terms of brain development, so the adverse consequences are much greater in the 2-year-old.""\n\nClearly, there\'s an advantage to not irradiating healthy brain tissue, she says. For instance, avoiding the brain\'s vision and auditory centers may save children from loss or impairment of sight or hearing.\n\nProton beam therapy allows doctors to give the same dose as with traditional radiation, while reducing the dose – and complications – to normal, healthy tissue, says Dr. Sameer Keole, medical director of the proton beam therapy program at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. It also allows the use of a higher dose than traditional X-ray radiation (also called photon radiation) to treat resistant tumors, while still protecting surrounding tissue.\n\nWith traditional radiation to the brain, the radiation scatters. ""That collateral radiation exposes large amounts of brain to low doses of radiation,"" says Dr. Thomas Merchant, chair of radiation oncology at St. Jude Children\'s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Even lower doses of radiation can be harmful, he adds.\n\n\n\nMassive proton beam technology behind the scenes. (Courtesy of Mayo Clinic)\n\nIn November 2015, the new St. Jude Red Frog Events Proton Therapy Center – the world\'s only proton-therapy center dedicated solely to the treatment of children – began treating kids with aggressive cancers, including brain tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma. ""There are certain brain tumors in children where we have to treat the entire brain and spine,"" Merchant says. ""If we give proton therapy, we don\'t have exit radiation into the chest and abdomen that you have when you treat someone with conventional radiation."" That may reduce long-term side effects in the heart and lungs.\n\nWith the newest form of proton therapy, called pencil-beam scanning – which conforms or shapes the highest-dose radiation to the targeted tumor – it\'s possible to reduce the ""margin"" area around the tumor exposed to radiation, Merchant says. That method, which is used by St. Jude, may eventually have the potential to reduce the risk of secondary cancers.\n\nDr. Anita Mahajan, a professor and chief of pediatric radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, says when she describes proton therapy to parents, she emphasizes that proton therapy is radiation.\n\nThe biggest difference, she explains, is that the subatomic particle, the proton, stops where the oncologists need it to. ""It has to get in, but we can stop it from coming out.""\n\nThat ability to avoid other organs is important. ""For instance, if we\'re treating a young child for pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma [a muscle and connective tissue cancer], one of the things we might be able to do is avoid the growth plates in the femurs,"" Mahajan says. ""That might give you less problem with growth asymmetry of the legs as they get older.""\n\nFuture fertility is a factor in cancer treatment planning. In cases involving radiation around the pelvic area, it\'s sometimes possible to avoid the ovaries in a young girl or the testes in a boy.\n\n\'Spaceship Hamster Wheel\'\n\nA proton is a positively charged atomic particle. In proton therapy, a powerful machine called a particle accelerator speeds protons up to reach a high energy level. The technology is massive – three stories high and weighting upward of 100 tons – requiring special housing within a treatment facility to contain the equipment and deliver the proton beams. A rotating device called a gantry releases protons to the tumor from different angles. You can take a quick virtual tour of proton beam therapy at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\n\n\n\nTreatment room at St. Jude Red Frog Events Proton Therapy Center. (Courtesy of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital/Peter Barta)\n\nIn the treatment room, patients are positioned on a table or in a specialized chair. CT or MRI scans are taken before each treatment to ensure accurate positioning. Some children need sedation to sleep through the treatment, while others who can remain still may stay awake.\n\nPatients may need immobilization devices to keep them in the proper, precise position for every proton-beam treatment. With brain cancer, patients usually wear a custom-fitted mask to maintain their position.\n\nParents can accompany children to the treatment room and see them settle in before treatment begins, Mahajan says. A child life specialist is part of the team to help children and families cope with the entire patient experience.\n\nWhile the treatment itself is painless, side effects can include skin problems like swelling, dryness, blistering or peeling – similar to traditional radiation. Fatigue, nausea and vomiting are side effects as well and are also due to other treatments patients receive, like chemotherapy.\n\nMeg McQuillan of Riverside, Connecticut, recalls her son\'s introduction to proton beam therapy three years ago, when he was treated at Mass General for a type of brain tumor called medulloblastoma. He and fellow patients named the device the ""spaceship hamster wheel.""\n\nYoung people take the treatment process in stride, Keole says. ""Kids are tough,"" he says. ""Sometimes they\'re a lot tougher than adults. By and large, they have a great attitude.""\n\nCost and Access\n\nThere are 23 operating proton beam centers in the U.S., according to the National Association for Proton Therapy, unevenly distributed throughout the country. Only a portion exist in the context of a pediatric-focused cancer program. Between 500 and 600 pediatric patients get proton radiation therapy each year, according to Yock\'s rough estimate.\n\nWith a typical treatment course lasting six weeks, families face the disruption of traveling to a children\'s hospital with a proton therapy center, finding lodging and making arrangements for other children at home.\n\nProton therapy costs roughly twice as much as traditional X-ray radiation. The average cost for a full course of proton radiation treatment is estimated at $40,000.\n\nCreating a new proton center is a huge investment. ""If you look at simply the upfront costs, it will be three to four times more expensive than photons,"" Yock says. ""It is absolutely intensive in terms of people and equipment needed and the quality assurance and the engineers and the physicists. It\'s a huge team that\'s required to run it safely, with good quality control.""\n\nYock co-authored a study published in December 2015 in the journal Cancer, which compared the cost-effectiveness of proton radiation therapy versus traditional radiation among kids with medulloblastoma. The study, which used models to measure long-term side effects and related costs in treatment, work-force participation and quality of life, found that proton therapy was cost-effective.\n\nAs Mahajan says, ""If we can prevent some neurocognitive deficits, endocrine issues, growth issues, skeletal deformities, those are going to help that child be more productive in society and need fewer medical interventions down the road.""\n\nInsurance usually covers the cost of proton therapy when a cancer is considered curable, Yock says: ""Ninety-eight percent of the time, we are successful with arguing to get a pediatric patient treatment,"" she says.']","Although the story offers precious little quantitative data or clinical trial results, it does a good job (from the headline to the end) of describing the pros and cons, costs and benefits of the treatment.","This magazine feature story falls firmly in the category of what science and medical journalists call an “explainer,” a relatively intensely reported effort to put context and common sense around an emerging and sometimes controversial discovery or treatment. In this case, it’s proton beam therapy (PBT), a sharply-focused form of radiation therapy whose tissue-sparing benefits are becoming somewhat clearer for pediatric cancer therapy, but whose rapidly expanding and heavily marketed availability still outstrips rigorous clinical evidence for wider use, especially in adult cancers of the prostate and other organs.
Although the article offers little quantitative data or clinical trial results, it does a good job (from the headline to the end) of describing the pros and cons, costs and benefits of the treatment.

352,story_reviews_00788,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/new-approach-could-treat-ms-other-autoimmune-diseases/,2012-11-18 05:00:00,"New approach could treat MS, other autoimmune diseases","['Researchers trying to find a way to treat multiple sclerosis think they’ve come up with an approach that could not only help patients with MS, but those with a range of so-called autoimmune diseases, from type-1 diabetes to psoriasis, and perhaps even food allergies.\n\nSo far it’s only worked in mice, but it has worked especially well. And while mice are different from humans in many ways, their immune systems are quite similar.\n\n“If this works, it is going to be absolutely fantastic,” said Bill Heetderks, who directs outside research at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, part of the National Institutes of Health, which helped pay for the research. “Even if it doesn’t work, it’s going to be another step down the road.”\n\nIn autoimmune disease, the body’s immune cells mistakenly attack and destroy healthy tissue. In MS, it’s the fatty protective sheath around the nerves; in type-1 or juvenile diabetes it’s cells in the pancreas that make insulin; in rheumatoid arthritis it’s tissue in the joint.\n\nCurrently, the main treatment is to suppress the immune system, an approach that can leave patients vulnerable to infections and cancer. The new treatment re-educates the immune cells so they stop the attacks.\n\nThe approach uses tiny little balls called nanoparticles made of the same material used to make surgical sutures that dissolve harmlessly in the body. They’re attached to little bits of the protein that the immune cells are attacking, the researchers report in Sunday’s issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology.\n\nStephen Miller of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago had been trying a slightly different approach to treating MS. When normal cells die naturally through a self-destruction process called apoptosis, immune cells called macrophages come in and eat up the mess.\n\nThe macrophages are carried to the spleen where they show these ground-up bits of cells to other immune cells called T-cells. It’s a kind of introduction that familiarizes the T-cells with the body’s normal cells. Then T-cells know not to attack healthy cells.\n\nMiller’s team had been trying to find ways to use this process to re-educate the T-cells. They have been attaching bits of the myelin that T-cells mistakenly attack to healthy cells from MS patients that were self-destructing, then infusing the concoction back into MS patients.\n\nThe idea would be to “introduce” the myelin to the T-cells at the same time they were “meeting” the healthy tissue, and educate them to leave the myelin alone.\n\nSo far the team has only shown the process is safe – a phase 1 clinical trial. But Miller says the experiment also seemed to show they were beginning to repair the patients’ immune systems. However, it was hideously expensive. “It cost probably about a million dollars to treat 10 patients using live cells,” he said.\n\nObviously, the researchers needed something cheaper. Miller got together with Lonnie Shea, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern. They substituted cheap little balls of plastic called polystyrene nanoparticles for the self-destructing cells.\n\nThese new nanoparticles stopped the course of a MS-like disease in mice, the researchers found. But polystyrene is no good to use in people. It doesn’t break down and contains a compound, styrene, that may cause cancer.\n\nShea had another possibility, called poly(lactide-co-glycolide) or PLG for short. “It turns out this is an FDA approved substance that is used in resorbable sutures,” said Miller.\n\n“There is nothing rare or exotic or strange here,” said NIBIB’s Heetderks. The particles are easy to produce, he said.\n\nThis worked just as well in mice. It only takes an hour in a chemical bath to attach little bits of myelin to the nanoparticles of PLG. When infused into a vein, they’re carried by the blood right to the spleen, where the nanoparticles “meet” the T-cells.\n\nIf the treatment was done as soon as the mice had their first MS-like attack, the attacks stopped. The effects lasted for the entire lives of the mice, Miller said.\n\nWhat’s great about the approach, Miller says, is that it can be used to treat any autoimmune disease. For diabetes, little bits of pancreatic beta cells could be attached to the nanoparticles. For a food allergy, the part of the food that causes the allergic response could be attached. “You can try to induce tolerance to peanuts or eggs or shellfish or whatever you are allergic to,” he said.\n\nOne shortcoming is that scientists don’t always know what’s causing an autoimmune disease. “We know that in rheumatoid arthritis, your joints get attacked, but what we don’t know really well is what specific protein in your joints is being attacked. We really need to know that before we can apply this therapy,” Miller said.\n\nNow the researchers are looking for funding so they can test this new approach in people. They’re in discussions with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to test it in people with type-1 diabetes, and the Myelin Repair Foundation to test it in MS patients, Miller said. They may form their own company to develop it as a medical treatment, something that would be years away.\n\nMice don’t live very long, and it’s not clear if human patients would need repeat treatments. But the T-cells that are re-educated usually live for a long time in the body, and have long memories, Miller said.\n\nIt’s also clear the approach would not repair any damage already done by the disease, so the best candidates would be patients having their very first symptoms. But it might be possible down the road to combine the nanoparticle treatment with another treatment to replace the damaged tissue in more advanced patients, Miller said.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nNew drug may help MS\n\nApproach turns off peanut allergies\n\nCan pot smoking ease MS symptoms?']",A little less excitement about the possibilities for treatments growing from this line of research would have made this story stronger.,"There are subtle differences between this story and a competing story by WebMD about the same research study on nanotechnology treatments for multiple sclerosis. But the differences are important. While WebMD took a more cautious tone from the top, this story puts too much weight on this one mouse study, promising not only new treatments for multiple sclerosis but also for “a range of so-called autoimmune diseases, from type-1 diabetes to psoriasis, and perhaps even food allergies.”

This finding could lead to the first advance in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones in 30 years.\n\nJeffrey Rimer, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Houston, was lead author of the study, published Aug. 8 in the online edition of Nature. The work offers the first evidence that the compound hydroxycitrate (HCA) is an effective inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal growth that, under certain conditions, is actually able to dissolve these crystals. Researchers also explain how it works.\n\nThe findings are the result of a combination of experimental studies, computational studies and human studies, Rimer said.\n\nKidney stones are small, hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys, affecting up to 12 percent of men and seven percent of women. High blood pressure, diabetes and obesity can increase the risk, and the reported incidence is on the rise.\n\nPreventive treatment has not changed much over the last three decades. Doctors tell patients who are at risk of developing stones to drink lots of water and avoid foods rich in oxalate, such as rhubarb, okra, spinach and almonds. They often recommend taking citrate (CA), in the form of potassium citrate, a supplement that can slow crystal growth, but some people are unable to tolerate the side effects.\n\nThe project grew out of preliminary work done by collaborator John Asplin, a nephrologist at Litholink Corporation, who suggested HCA as a possible treatment. HCA is chemically similar to CA and is also available as a dietary supplement.\n\n""HCA shows promise as a potential therapy to prevent kidney stones,"" the researchers wrote. ""HCA may be preferred as a therapy over CA (potassium citrate).""\n\nIn addition to Rimer and Asplin, authors on the paper include Giannis Mpourmpakis and his graduate student, Michael G. Taylor, of the University of Pittsburgh; Ignacio Granja of Litholink Corporation, and Jihae Chung, a UH graduate student working in Rimer\'s lab.\n\nThe head-to-head studies of CA and HCA determined that while both compounds inhibit the growth of calcium oxalate crystals, HCA was more potent and displayed unique qualities that are advantageous for the development of new therapies.\n\nThe team of researchers then used atomic force microscopy, or AFM, to study interactions between the crystals, CA and HCA under realistic growth conditions. According to Rimer, the technique allowed them to record crystal growth in real time with near-molecular resolution.\n\nChung noted that the AFM images recorded the crystal actually shrinking when exposed to specific concentrations of HCA. Rimer suspected the initial finding was an abnormality, as it is rare to see a crystal actually dissolve in highly supersaturated growth solutions. The most effective inhibitors reported in the literature simply stop the crystal from growing.\n\nIt turned out that Chung\'s initial finding was correct. Once they confirmed it is possible to dissolve crystals in supersaturated solutions, researchers then looked at reasons to explain why that happened.\n\nMpourmpakis and Taylor applied density functional theory (DFT) - a highly accurate computational method used to study the structure and properties of materials - to address how HCA and CA bind to calcium and to calcium oxalate crystals. They discovered HCA formed a stronger bond with crystal surfaces, inducing a strain that is seemingly relieved by the release of calcium and oxalate, leading to crystal dissolution.\n\nHCA was also tested in human subjects, as seven people took the supplement for three days, allowing researchers to determine that HCA is excreted through urine, a requirement for the supplement to work as a treatment.\n\nWhile Rimer said the research established the groundwork to design an effective drug, questions remain. Long-term safety, dosage and additional human trials are needed, he said.\n\n""But our initial findings are very promising,"" he said. ""If it works in vivo, similar to our trials in the laboratory, HCA has the potential to reduce the incidence rate of people with chronic kidney stone disease.""\n\n###']",The lead author of a study on a potential treatment to prevent kidney stones holds a related patent. But the release offers no disclosure.,"This release from the University of Houston says a molecular cousin of a supplement commonly recommended to prevent kidney stones could turn out to be a better option. The wording is generally cautious, making clear that the researchers are merely proposing further study. However, the top of the release is vague about the published research. Readers have to dig down before they are told that the work was primarily a chemistry experiment comparing the commonly recommended supplement, citrate, with a related molecule, hydroxycitrate, and that a small human test was done just to see if hydroxycitrate is excreted in urine, not whether it has any health effects.
The release falls short by not mentioning that the study author quoted holds a patent on the use of a molecule for kidney stone treatment  The release also omits any discussion of the price of hydroxycitrate or its potential harms.

But scientists say larger, more rigorous studies are needed.\n\nIn fire cupping, burning cotton is placed inside a glass cup, which creates a vacuum as it cools.\n\nCupping, as the practice is called, was performed traditionally in China and other countries, and is now available from acupuncturists, and some chiropractors and massage therapists in the U.S. In the traditional method, called fire cupping, a ball of burning cotton is briefly placed inside a glass cup to heat the air inside, which then creates a partial vacuum as it cools. Newer-style plastic or silicone cups have valves that attach to hand pumps used to create suction.\n\nUntil recently, there was scant published evidence in favor of cupping for pain relief. Over the past three years, a handful of new studies have shown it helps relieve back, neck, carpal tunnel and knee pain.\n\nThere are a number of theories on how cupping may work to relieve pain. A widely held one is that suction on the skin ""increases blood flow to the area and creates a mild immune response,"" says Kathleen Lumiere, an assistant professor of acupuncture and oriental medicine at Bastyr University in Kenmore, Wash. It also helps release fascia, connective tissue that can pull on muscles causing pain or limited motion, clinicians say.\n\nTypically cups are on for up to 20 minutes and leave a temporary reddish mark that looks ""like rare roast beef,"" says Brian K. Nathanson, a Norwalk, Conn., chiropractor who has been doing cupping for about five years.\n\nSome clinicians slide the cups on the body, using them as massage tools in a technique sometimes called running cupping. ""People who love deep-tissue massage love cupping,"" says Gabrielle Francis, a Manhattan chiropractor and acupuncturist who does both static cupping and running cupping. Both can cause mild discomfort in some patients, clinicians say.\n\nCupping is an ancient healing art that was traditionally practiced in China, the Middle East and other countries. Corbis\n\nGwyneth Paltrow caused a stir when she appeared with cupping marks on her back at a movie screening in New York in 2004. Associated Press\n\nThe intrepid can opt for ""wet cupping,"" in which the skin is punctured with a lancet before the cups are applied. The technique, which draws out a small quantity of blood, can have a powerful effect—particularly on areas where you can feel a hard lump of knotted muscles, says Kristine Tohtz, a Chicago chiropractor and acupuncturist who does wet and dry cupping.\n\nCost of cupping varies widely, from $40 to $100 or more for a half-hour session. It shouldn\'t be done on pregnant women, people with heart conditions or people with bleeding disorders, clinicians say. Caution should be used if a person has thin skin that might tear easily.\n\nIn a study of people with neck pain caused by computer use, ""cupping therapy was effective in reducing pain,"" says Tae-Hun Kim, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine in Daejeon, South Korea. The 40-person study, published online in September in the Journal of Occupational Health, found that six cupping sessions over two weeks was more effective on average in relieving pain than a heating pad—and the benefit lasted a month after treatment ended.\n\nBut, says Romy Lauche, a scientist at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Essen, Germany, ""the studies are very preliminary. We cannot say it has proven its efficacy.""\n\nDr. Lauche co-authored a 50-person study published last year that found a single wet-cupping treatment on average significantly reduced chronic neck pain three days after the treatment, compared with a control group that had no treatment. Location of the cups varied with each patient but typically was on the trapezius muscle, which spans the neck, shoulders and upper back. In unpublished results, she adds, scientists found the pain relief lasted for months.\n\nIn a 40-person German study published in October, cupping therapy significantly relieved knee arthritis pain compared with patients who received no treatment. But the study\'s lack of a control group treated with a sham technique ""raises questions of whether it is cupping that is really working or if it has a placebo effect,"" says David Felson, who directs an arthritis research program at Boston University School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Lauche agrees that lack of a placebo control is a flaw in the studies. A new study, currently ongoing for fibromyalgia pain, is testing cupping against a sham cup that attaches with adhesive and provides minimal suction, she says.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com\n\nWrite to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com']",Here is another story on an alternative treatment that is not backed up by hard data.,"The article uses hyped-up language, such as “significantly reduced” and “significantly relieved,” without citing any numbers to back these claims up.

So, the researchers theorized that the poor performance of the supplements may simply reflect the overwhelming power of the medications.\n\nStudy author Daan Kromhout, from the division of human nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, is to present the findings Sunday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Stockholm; the study will appear online in the New England Journal of Medicine simultaneously.\n\nIn the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men.\n\nAll had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins.\n\nAt the study\'s start, the patients were instructed to consume (over a period lasting a little over three years) one of four different types of margarines: one supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids; one supplemented with the plant-derived ALA; one supplemented with both omega-3 fatty acids and ALA; and one with no supplements.\n\nThe amount of supplementation added to the various margarines was deemed to be ""low-dose."" During the study, the patients consumed an average of 18.8 grams of margarine per day, which meant ingestion of an average of 226 milligrams of EPA combined with 150 milligrams of DHA omega-3 fatty acids and/or 1.9 grams of ALA.\n\nBy the study\'s end, almost 14 percent of the heart attack patients had experienced another ""major cardiovascular event,"" with some cases ending in death.\n\nNone of the low-dose supplements seemed to stave off such events in most of the patients. One exception appeared to be among women ingesting ALA; researchers saw a 27 percent reduction in the risk for further cardiac complications, although that reduction did not quite reach statistical significance.\n\n""The bottom-line finding of the Alpha Omega Trial is that [omega]-3 fatty acids did not reduce the primary endpoint major cardiovascular events,"" Kromhout said, noting that the ALA finding needs further confirmation.\n\nDr. Murray A. Mittleman, director of the cardiovascular epidemiology research unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said he was ""not that surprised by these results.""\n\n""Other studies have shown no benefit from omega-3, other than specifically protecting against cardiac death linked to arrhythmia among patients who have just survived a heart attack,"" Mittleman noted. It is during this acute post-attack period, he explained, when patients are most vulnerable to a subsequent event.\n\n""But here, in some cases the patients they looked at are years following their first heart attack when they start taking these supplements,"" he stressed. ""So, that\'s a big difference in what kind of patient they\'re examining. And they\'re also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow. And on top of that, the supplement doses they use here are very low, much lower than those used in prior studies.""\n\n""So it might be big differences in study design that account for this new finding,"" Mittleman cautioned. ""In any case, I would say this is absolutely worth further investigation.""\n\nDr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed.\n\n""It is possible that improvements in other treatments for heart attack patients have made fish oil supplementation less important for reducing cardiovascular risk,"" he acknowledged. ""But it\'s also possible that the different dosing used in this study relative to previous work made a difference in the outcome. The dosing here may have been just too low, whereas higher doses given immediately following an initial heart attack might have been protective.""\n\n""So I would say,"" Fonarow added, ""that this is by no means the final word regarding omega-3s and cardiovascular health.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on omega-3 fatty acids, visit the National Institutes of Health.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A reasonably cautious summary of a paper that had not yet been presented at a European conference at the time the story was written. </span>"," We were frankly a bit surprised at the number of stories on this study – this one even being filed well before the paper was even presented at the Curopean Society of Cardiology Congress in Stockholm.  Was it that earth-shattering?  However, at least this story did seek independent perspectives as part of their story – even if filed early.  (Also see reviews of AP and Reuters.)

The international study found that it protects against HPV infection in women older than 26 years. Vaccination programs worldwide currently target routine vaccination of women 26 years and younger.\n\nThe study recruited women in 12 countries across four continents. Cosette Wheeler, PhD, at The University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, was the lead author of the report.\n\nWhyThe human papillomaviruses cause cancer of the cervix, anus, and middle throat. Five types of HPV account for about 85 percent of all invasive cervical cancer cases. HPV vaccines are expected to prevent most of these cancer cases.\n\nMany countries routinely vaccinate girls and boys 25 years and younger, although vaccination rates in the United States remain low. In the US, only about 40 percent of girls and 21 percent of boys receive the three-dose vaccination series. The earlier the vaccine is given, the more efficacious it can be.\n\nThis study focused on the benefit of vaccinating women 26 years and older. Infection with HPV can take place at any time throughout adulthood and women in this age group may have already been exposed to HPV. The study showed that women in this age group were still protected from HPV infections.\n\nThe scientists followed each woman for four to seven years. They found that the vaccine protected the women against HPV infections during the follow-up period and that the women were protected from many types of HPV across a broad age range. These study results are essential to new approaches in cancer prevention, particularly those that are investigating combined approaches of cervical screening and vaccination in adult women.\n\nWhoCosette Wheeler, PhD is a UNM Regents Professor in the Departments of Pathology and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. She holds the Victor and Ruby Hansen Surface Endowed Chair in Translational Medicine and Public Health. Her New Mexico research group has contributed for over 20 years to understanding the molecular epidemiology of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in cervical precancer and cancer among Native American, Hispanic and non-Hispanic women of the southwest and on a global basis. She has overseen a number of large-scale multidisciplinary population-based projects that have ultimately enabled advances in primary (HPV vaccines) and secondary cervical cancer prevention (Pap and HPV tests).\n\nDr. Wheeler has authored over 200 peer-reviewed articles a number in top tier journals. In 2008 Sciencewatch (Thomson Reuters http://sciencewatch.com/ana/st/hpv/08julHPVWheler/) ranked her global citation contributions over the past decade, 7th in human papillomavirus contributions and in the top 1% in the field of clinical medicine.\n\nWhenThe paper, “Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the human papillomavirus 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in women older than 25 years: 7-year follow-up of the phase 3, double-blind, randomised controlled VIVIANE study,” was published in the June 28, 2016 online edition of The Lancet (www.thelancet.com/infection).\n\nAuthors are: Cosette M Wheeler, S Rachel Skinner, M Rowena Del Rosario-Raymundo, Suzanne M Garland, Archana Chatterjee, Eduardo Lazcano-Ponce, Jorge Salmerón, Shelly McNeil, Jack T Stapleton, Céline Bouchard, Mark G Martens, Deborah M Money, Swee Chong Quek, Barbara Romanowski, Carlos S Vallejos, Bram ter Harmsel, Vera Prilepskaya, Kah Leng Fong, Henry Kitchener, Galina Minkina, Yong Kuei Timothy Lim, Tanya Stoney, Nahida Chakhtoura, Margaret E Cruickshank, Alevtina Savicheva, Daniel Pereira da Silva, Murdo Ferguson, Anco C Molijn, Wim G V Quint, Karin Hardt, Dominique Descamps, Pemmaraju V Suryakiran, Naveen Karkada, Brecht Geeraerts, Gary Dubin, and Frank Struyf, for the VIVIANE Study Group.\n\nContactDorothy Hornbeck, JKPR, 505-340-5929, dhornbeck@jameskorenchen.com Michele Sequeira, UNM Cancer Center, 505-925-0486, msequeira@salud.unm.edu\n\nAbout the UNM Comprehensive Cancer CenterThe University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center is the Official Cancer Center of New Mexico and the only National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Center in a 500-mile radius.

We aren’t even told how many women were enrolled.","The news release describes a recent study published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases demonstrating the potential benefits of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in women 26 years and older. While the release makes an admirable attempt at summarizing the study in a concise and easy-to-understand manner, the resulting brevity leaves many questions unanswered regarding a public health issue as important as HPV. In particular, the release does not account for the specific study design — no sample sizes were reported and demographics of the patient volunteers were not described. Furthermore the specific benefits of HPV vaccination in women 26 years and older are not explicitly stated.
The news release devotes much of its focus on the lead author’s research biography. Journalists and other readers would have been better served if the “Who” section instead described the women who were recruited for the study and how many had a history of HPV infections, for example.

Called edaravone – brand name Radicava – its FDA approval this week was met with a wave of excitement from the media and the ALS community.\n\nBut some physicians are raising concerns over the cost of the drug and whether or not patients will be able to get it, as well as noting misconceptions about how effective at fighting this degenerative condition this drug will actually be.\n\nEach year, doctors diagnose anywhere between 5,000 to 6,000 Americans with this rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease, and the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 12,000 to 15,000 people at any given time in the U.S. live with the disease. The majority of these patients die within two to five years of diagnosis.\n\nThe FDA approval is based on a study of 137 people with ALS published earlier this year. Patients received either a placebo pill or edaravone over a six-month period. Researchers found that those getting edaravone had a 33 percent reduction in their rate of decline in physical function.\n\nIt’s a finding that inspires hope of slowing -- but not yet stopping or reversing -- the progression of this disease.\n\nDr. Leo McCluskey, who leads the University of Pennsylvania’s ALS Center and was not involved in the study nor in the approval of this drug, said the findings are promising but he added that he fears they could be misinterpreted.\n\n“Thirty percent is pretty robust,” McCluskey said. But he nonetheless added, “We have patients calling our center asking for the cure to ALS, and this is not a cure.”\n\nAnd then there is the price tag. According to MT Pharma America, the company behind Radicava, the cost is around $1,000 per infusion – and treatment, which involves multiple infusions, may total about $146,000 per year.\n\n“This is just for the drug; you also need a nurse and infusion equipment,” McCluskey said. “We don’t know who is going to cover it or what criteria will be used to decide who gets it.”\n\nMcCluskey also expressed concerns about the feasibility of ALS patients with reduced mobility going to receive daily infusions. “Imagine you’re a patient with difficulty moving around, and you now have to come in every day to receive infusions.”\n\nAnd the number of infusions needed means many such trips. Edaravone is administered by an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes in 28-day cycles. The initial cycle involves a daily infusion for two weeks, followed by a two-week period without infusions. Additional cycles consist of infusions for 10 days over two weeks followed by two-week drug-free periods.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Tom Larson, the chief commercial officer for MT Pharma America, said the company is already taking steps to streamline the process for obtaining Radicava. The company has set up a system called Searchlight, through which patients and physicians can apply for the drug, obtain benefits information, identify an infusion center and schedule an infusion. Larson said the company has partnered with over 1,100 infusion centers across the country in an effort to “make this as easy and accessible to patients as possible.”\n\nAs for the costs and coverage of the drug, Larson said insurance companies are still deciding whether they will pay for Radicava. “We are in the process every new pharmaceutical goes through as payers make a decision.”\n\nEdith Bracho-Sanchez, M.D., is a pediatrics resident at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.']","This new drug comes with many limitations, and patients deserve to know all of them.","This ABC story undertakes a worthy goal — throwing a dose of reality on a new drug for ALS, Radicava, that’s being billed as the first to be approved in 22 years. This story attempts to ground the glowing headlines by right away focusing on the drug’s high cost, intensiveness of administering, and importantly, to remind readers that this is not a cure.
But, the story didn’t explain that this drug was only shown to work in a very specific small subset of ALS patients. The description of this subset of patients is not given, suggesting to readers that this drug could work for any ALS patient, which is misleading.  
Update: This review prompted us to explore this issue further in a blog post, “Facts about the new ALS drug Radicava that you’re unlikely to see in news stories.”

REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\n\nTheir findings, published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, also provide some new insights into the development of days-old embryos, such as how babies inherit some genes from the mother and some from the father.\n\nThey said the new test could help fertility clinics pick the best embryo to implant in the womb.\n\nThis would save mothers from having several treatments and help improve on the current method of implanting multiple embryos to try to get one pregnancy and risk multiple births in the process.\n\n“Our results shed light on human embryo development,” wrote Renee Reijo Pera of Stanford University in California and colleagues. “Our methods and algorithms may provide an approach for early diagnosis of embryo potential in assisted reproduction.”\n\nSo called test-tube babies are conceived by uniting egg and sperm in a lab dish and transferring the embryo into a woman’s uterus to develop. Most do not develop properly and labs have been looking for ways to improve their success rate.\n\nAlthough it is not recommended, some IVF clinics will implant more than one embryo into the mother’s womb — leading to the birth of triplets, quadruplets and even more. Such babies almost always are born too early and face lifelong health problems.\n\nAll pregnancies are tenuous, even those achieved the old fashioned way. The March of Dimes, a charity founded to battle birth defects, estimates that as many as 50 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage — most often before a woman knows she is pregnant.\n\nFor the new test the researchers watched embryos divide and develop from the time sperm met egg in a lab dish. As the embryos split and grew, they also tested gene expression — looking at which genes activated, and when.\n\nTo their surprise, they found that almost from the very beginning some of the handful of cells had different sets of active genes.\n\nAn embryo’s fate — whether it would develop normally or not — seemed determined in many cases from the moment of conception and relied heavily on the mother’s egg cell, they found.\n\nEmbryos most likely to form a ball of cells called a blastocyst developed at a certain, measurable rate, they found.\n\nAuxogyn, Inc., a privately held medical technology company, said in a statement it had acquired an exclusive license from Stanford University to develop products related to the findings.\n\n“Blastocyst formation is a critical time point in human embryo development and provides more objective criteria for selecting which embryo(s) to transfer,” Lissa Goldenstein, president and CEO of Auxogyn, said in a statement.\n\n“For years, researchers have searched for ways to predict the embryos most likely to reach the blastocyst stage in order to enable earlier transfer and ultimately improve live birth rates for in vitro fertilization procedures.”\n\nThe company estimates that there are 500 clinics in the United States providing in vitro fertilization or IVF services, with combined annual revenues of nearly $2 billion.']","News of a better way to predict ""which test-tube embryos are the most likely to develop properly"" must sound wonderful to couples trying In Vitro Fertilization. But the story doesn’t make clear that this lab work is all about blastocysts, not babies.","This year’s Nobel Prize in Medicine went to Robert Edwards, a UK physiologist who, over 30 years ago, developed the technique for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Since then, IVF has become an enourmous industry. An individual cycle of IVF can cost $10-15,000 but the average chance of success is roughly 1 in 5 (varying widely according to many factors). Therefore, any improvements in the technique to improve the success rate is welcome news to potential parents. 
This story reports on a new technique that entails observing the embryo divide and develop to attempt to predict which ones would have the highest chance of success. While this method may be truly an advancement in IVF technology, this story does little to educate readers on its potential importance. It provides inadequate information about the availability, costs and potential harms of IVF. It does not discuss the strength of the evidence to support the new technique nor does it describe the success rates of the procedure compared to existing methods. The story does not quote any independent sources that could have provided some perspective on the importance of the results, which is sorely missing from this story. Most distressing, the story exagerrates the perils of pregnancy by providing such scary statistics as the 50% miscarriage rate.  In doing so, it overstates the need for reproductive assistance technologies, including IVF.
In the end, this story appears to be little more than a thinly-veiled advertisement for IVF, an industry which is in little need of help.

In the new study, if even one cell was detected in the bloodstream, a woman had a greater chance of her cancer recurring and of dying.\n\n""This may help with prognosis and staging of the cancer and, in the future, with targets for breast cancer treatments,"" said study lead author Dr. Anthony Lucci, a professor of surgery at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, ""We are moving into a state where we\'re looking at a person\'s individual tumor and this is another way to do that, potentially leading to treatment.""\n\nWhether or not cancer has spread to the lymph nodes is currently the best way to predict survival in women with breast cancer. Even so, a substantial number of patients whose cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes will have a recurrence while some of those who do have lymph-node involvement won\'t relapse.\n\nBlood tests similar to the one investigated in this study have been found to be useful to gauge how well patients who already have metastatic cancer will do.\n\nFor this study, researchers counted circulating tumor cells in 302 breast cancer patients who were about to undergo surgery but who hadn\'t yet received chemotherapy.\n\nCirculating tumor cells were detectable in about one-quarter of the participants, the investigators found. Fifteen percent of these individuals had a relapse and 10 percent died during a five-year follow-up, compared with 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of patients who did not have circulating tumor cells.\n\nThe more tumor cells a woman had in her bloodstream, the higher the likelihood of relapsing or dying, according to the report.\n\nAlthough the test may not be far off in terms of clinical practice, ""we need additional studies,"" Lucci said.\n\nOne area for study is how well these circulating cells predict recurrence and death in patients who have already had chemotherapy.\n\nCurrently, the American Society of Clinical Oncology does not recommend that clinicians measure circulating tumor cells in patients.\n\nAnd in an accompanying comment article, Justin Stebbing, a professor in the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College in London, said that ""despite increasing evidence supporting the use of [circulating tumor cells] as biomarkers, how this information can be integrated into present practice is uncertain.""\n\nAccording to Bernik, though, ""it makes sense that women who have circulating tumor cells would potentially be at higher risk of distant disease at some later date.""\n\nThe problem is that just having circulating tumor cells may not be enough information to foretell the future, she noted.\n\n""The cells also need to have a propensity to grow elsewhere,"" she said. ""Not every cancer cell becomes a metastatic cancer cell. Hopefully, gaining the ability to tell which cells are more likely to spread potentially could guide therapy,"" Bernik added.\n\nAccording to Lucci, circulating tumor cells are also showing promise in predicting melanoma prognosis, so the method may be ""effective in several different tumor systems.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on breast cancer.']",Any story that begins with “a simple blood test” is going to get our skeptical antenna up.  Drawing the blood may be simple.  Anything that happens next is not.,"The small number of patients in the study, the relatively short follow-up time, and the lack of information about treatment lessen the importance of news of a blood test that may predict relapse of early stage breast cancer patients.

Participants were nasally administered doses of man-made insulin called insulin detemir for 21 days.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe insulin detemir is designed to attach to album, a blood protein.

Because the insulin detemir dissolves from the protein slowly, it has a longer period of exposure in the body, lead study author Dr. Suzanne Craft, professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest Baptist told FoxNews.com.\n\nParticipants who received 40 international unit (IU) doses of insulin detemir over the course of the trial showed significant improvement in their short-term ability to retain and process verbal and visual information, compared with those who received 20 IU doses or a placebo. According to Craft, performance on tests of mental manipulation and memory improved by as much as 25 percent.\n\nEven recipients who carried the APOE-e4 gene – which is proven to increase Alzheimer\'s risk – showed significantly higher memory scores than those who received the lower dosage or placebo.\n\n“Our team was surprised at the level of improvement for the participants with the gene that raises Alzheimer\'s risk, as very few types of therapies have been shown to benefit these patients,” Craft said.\n\nFurther research is needed to determine the mechanisms behind insulin detemir’s effect on memory.\n\nThe insulin detemir doses did not cause any negative side effects, and Craft said the study\'s overall results support further investigation of insulin detemir as a treatment for Alzheimer\'s and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nResearchers hope to follow up on the pilot study in a larger group of participants who would receive the insulin detemir for a longer period of time.

Food addicts suffer from the same neurobiological conditions so we believe it will help food addicts as well and our initial tests have backed up that theory.\n\n""This could have important implications for people who are obese. There is mounting evidence to show that there is a substantial number of obese people who are food addicts because they have an inability to control their impulsive actions and this drug has shown it can give them more control, which will help overweight people lose weight and so improve their health.\n\n""Food addicts know they need to lose weight, but the desire for more food is overwhelming, leading to a spiral of depression that can lead to psychological issues as well as health problems.""\n\nThe drug, which is sold under a wide variety of brand names around the world, was one of two drugs tested by researchers, the other being Atomoxetine. Both drugs have been used for impulsive conditions, including ADHD.\n\nIn the paper Pharmacological manipulation of impulsivity: A randomized controlled trial published in Personality and Individual Differences, the scientists conducted a series of trials on 60 men aged between 19 and 32, with 20 taking a placebo, 20 Atomoxetine and 20 Modafinil.\n\nThe tests revealed that those who had taken Modafinil had a significantly reduced level of impulsiveness, whereas Atomoxetine produced no difference compared to the placebo group.\n\n""Modafinil was found to have an effect on impulsivity in healthy individuals and so would be able to have an even bigger effect on food addicts, who are lacking in certain types of dopamine,"" said Professor Vlaev.\n\n""This drug could be a real help to those people struggling to control their desire for food even though they know they should lose weight.\n\n""The drug improves self-control, which is a key factor in determining obesity, so our hypothesis is that this drug should help in treating the disease.""\n\n###\n\nFor a copy of the paper email Ashley.potter@wbs.ac.uk\n\nTo interview Ivo Vlaev contact:\n\nEmail: Ivo.Vlaev@wbs.ac.uk\n\nOr contact:\n\nAshley Potter\n\nPress & PR Executive\n\nWarwick Business School\n\nThe University of Warwick\n\nCoventry\n\nCV4 7AL\n\nTel: +44 (0)24 7657 3967\n\nMob: +44 (0)7733 013264\n\nEmail: Ashley.potter@wbs.ac.uk\n\nWarwick Business School is the largest department of the University of Warwick and is triple accredited by the leading global business education associations - the first in the UK to attain this accreditation.

The release claims that after a single dose, one of the drugs, Modafinil, reduced impulsive behavior in the study’s 60 normal weight males who volunteered for the trial.

It now appears that deep brain stimulation also increases the liver’s and muscles’ ability to take up and use insulin, researchers reported this week.\n\nThat’s important because the ability to use insulin effectively is compromised in most people with obesity and seriously impaired in those with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThis curious side effect of deep brain stimulation became clear after an obese man with diabetes who had suffered the repetitive thoughts and behaviors of OCD was treated for the psychiatric condition with a device that delivers electrical impulses into the brain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce the device was implanted and turned on, it prompted the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine throughout the ventral striatum, in which the nucleus accumbens sits. In short order, the patient noticed that his blood sugar control improved, and his daily need for insulin injections decreased by roughly 80%.\n\nThe new study appeared this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nThe research is likely to generate renewed interest in understanding the addictive powers of food for some people and whether the brain processes behind that addiction also make people with obesity more vulnerable to diabetes, depression, heart disease and even some cancers.\n\n“The connection between brain and metabolism is only partially understood,” said Dr. Miguel Alonso-Alonso, who directs Harvard University’s Mind Brain Behavior Interfaculty Initiative. Most research to date has focused on the hormonal influence of the hypothalamus, a structure adjoining the ventral striatum, on basic bodily functions, he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is a new and exciting direction with the involvement of the striatum, a key reward center,” Alonso-Alonso said. At the same time, he cautioned that “we first need to establish the nature of this association, understand its magnitude and its clinical relevance” before these early findings could be considered the basis for treatment.\n\nThat a single patient’s metabolic function improved after he got a pacemaker in the brain might have met with a shrug anywhere else. But to the Dutch authors of the new research, it was a clue that warranted further investigation.\n\nTo explore the brain’s role in metabolism more rigorously, the researchers, led by Kasper W. ter Horst of the University of Amsterdam’s Academic Medical Center, recruited 14 patients who also had had a brain stimulator implanted at the edge of the nucleus accumbens as treatment for OCD.\n\nNone of the 14 subjects recruited had type 2 diabetes. But even healthy people vary daily and hourly in the ability of fat, liver and muscles to take up insulin from the bloodstream and use it to convert food to energy.\n\nThis measure of metabolic health is called “insulin sensitivity,” and it is one of many metabolic functions that goes awry in people with obesity. In those who develop type 2 diabetes, sensitivity to insulin becomes so impaired that the body is tricked into believing less insulin is needed, and it pares back its production. The insulin-producing cells in the pancreas will often atrophy and die in response. As a person’s insulin production declines, an external supply of insulin is needed to control blood sugar and deliver fuel to muscles and organs.\n\nAs the researchers turned the 12 subjects’ brain stimulators on and off, they could see the subjects’ insulin sensitivity rise and fall. Metabolic function was better when their brain stimulators were turned on than when the devices were silenced.\n\nThe Dutch team ruled out that the performance improvement came from changes in other hormones that can affect metabolism, such as cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine. The action of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens appeared to be effecting the changes.\n\nThe researchers also gleaned a potentially important insight about how obesity may lead to worsening metabolic function: The effect of the deep brain stimulation appeared to be greater in the seven research subjects who were lean than it was in the seven who were either overweight or obese. Since long-term obesity is linked to changes in the striatal dopamine system, the differing responses of lean and overweight subjects suggest that those changes may start the ball rolling toward development of type 2 diabetes..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a further experimental group of 10 healthy humans, the researchers found that using drugs to reduce dopamine levels across the body generated the opposite response, decreasing insulin sensitivity.\n\nIn mice, too, the researchers explored the role of the dopamine-fueled neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Using a technique called optogenetics, they bred mice with certain brain cells that could be activated when light of a particular frequency is shined on them.\n\nLight stimulation of the dopamine-expressing neurons in the brains of mice “was sufficient to improve glucose tolerance” and improve insulin sensitivity, the authors reported. That suggests “a key role for striatal neuronal activity in the central regulation of metabolism,” they added.\n\nThe emerging data “suggest that the brain may play a much more active and complex role in the regulation of metabolism than we usually believe,” said Alonso-Alonso, who has explored the brain’s role in metabolism by using a less invasive means of activation called transcranial magnetic stimulation.\n\n“This makes sense, because at the end, metabolic needs should align well with the overall state of the individual,” he said. It stands to reason that there’s cross-talk among key physiological functions; an individual’s cognitive, mental and social states; and situational circumstances, he added.\n\n“I think there are real good opportunities here for this integrative research; we need to learn more about this connection,” Alonso-Alonso said.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\n@LATMelissaHealy\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE IN SCIENCE\n\nThe asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs also shaped the evolution of birds\n\nTo get smokers to quit, money works better than electronic cigarettes\n\nNew ‘unified theory’ of childhood leukemia raises possibility of preventing the disease']",The headline undermines the overall message of the story with phrasing suggesting a new treatment option: “may offer treatment”,"
This Los Angeles Times story reports on a study with some tantalizing new information about connections between the brain and the body’s metabolism. The research is novel, very preliminary, and more about introducing a new avenue of study for researchers rather than a new therapy for people with type 2 diabetes. The story maintained this framing well — that the findings are useful for researchers more than clinicians at this time. However, the headline and the photo credit undermine this carefulness with phrasing suggesting a new treatment option:  “may offer treatment” and “may provide alternative treatment.” Given that the headline may be the only part of this article seen by many readers, it’s an important shortcoming.

Could getting vaccinated be as easy as putting on a bandage? Could there be fewer, or at least smaller, needles in our future?\n\nSome companies and academic labs are working to make those things happen.\n\nThey\'re refining technologies that involve tiny needles, less than a millimeter long, and needle-free injectors that can send a dose of vaccine through your skin in a fraction of a second.\n\nSome of these technologies are already available on the market, while others are still being tested.\n\nOne hundred very tiny needles\n\nA flu vaccine patch is not yet available to the public. But one version developed by Georgia Tech\'s Laboratory for Drug Delivery showed promising results in its first human clinical trial, according to a study published in The Lancet in June.\n\nThe patch, about the size of a small square bandage, has tiny, dissolvable needles filled with a dose of flu vaccine. It\'s placed on the arm and activated through pressure. The microneedles dissolve into the skin, releasing the vaccine.\n\nIn the study, 100 participants received either the flu vaccine patch, a standard flu shot or a placebo via a patch.\n\nSix months later, no one involved in the study had gotten the flu. People in the microneedle patch groups reported some redness, itching and tenderness but no serious side effects.\n\nPeople who received the flu patch had comparable immune responses to people who had gotten the flu shot.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the patients in the study preferred the patch to the regular shot, says Yasmine Gomaa, the lab\'s associate director.\n\nNow, Gomaa\'s lab is looking beyond the flu vaccine. She says the microneedle patch could be particularly helpful in developing countries because it uses a form of vaccines that doesn\'t need to be kept as cold as regular vaccines. It can be stored at temperatures as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit for up to a year, she says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Georgia Institute of Technology Courtesy of Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nAnd the patch can be administered by people who aren\'t trained health professionals. A number of the people in the flu patch study applied it to themselves.\n\nIn 2015, Georgia Tech and the pharmaceutical company Micron Biomedical won $2.5 million in grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a patch for polio immunization.\n\nGomaa\'s hope is that vaccine patches will cost less than vaccinations do now.\n\nA 2016 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the use of vaccine patches could save on cooling costs and could cut down on waste. Its analysis concluded that a dose of measles vaccine with the patch would cost just under $1, while a typical shot would cost $1.65. But that didn\'t take into account the costs of getting the patch to market.\n\nThe potential cost savings wouldn\'t happen until the patches were in ""routine use,"" the CDC noted.\n\nA twist on Star Trek technology\n\nOthers in the vaccine-delivery business are taking a different approach, using a new twist on a needle-free device called a jet injector that has been around for more than half a century.\n\nStar Trek featured such a device, calling it a ""hypospray.""\n\nPortal Instruments, a company that is developing jet injectors, uses technology based on work done by Ian Hunter at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n""Initially, we worked on microneedles,"" says the company\'s CEO Patrick Anquetil. ""And then Ian realized that why don\'t we just remove the needle altogether? And that\'s how this project came to be.""\n\nNeedle-free jet injectors were actually used in the 1960s in mass smallpox vaccination campaigns. As described by the CDC, these devices use a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin. The diameter of the stream is comparable to a mosquito bite.\n\nThe devices were used to quickly vaccinate large numbers of people, including members of the armed forces.\n\nAnquetil notes that the older devices sometimes made patients feel as if they had been punched.\n\n""To create the jet, you have to instantaneously create 100 times more pressure than you\'ve got in the tire of a car,"" he says. ""Patients actually hated them because they were more painful than a needle and syringe.""\n\nOthers echo that sentiment.\n\n""My 85-year-old neighbor still remembers how painful it was,"" says Ron Lowy, CEO of PharmaJet, a company that makes an FDA-approved jet injector that administers a flu vaccine.\n\nThe older devices had another problem. They used the same nozzle for multiple injections, leading to concerns about the transmission of bloodborne pathogens between patients.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of PharmaJet Courtesy of PharmaJet\n\nToday\'s devices have made a lot of progress, Lowy says. Now, the syringe is changed for each patient and the injections are gentler.\n\n""It feels like somebody snapped me with a rubber band,"" he says, adding that the injection happens too fast for some patients to register any sensation at all. It lasts about one-tenth of a second.\n\nHe says hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have already received the flu vaccine via one of PharmaJet\'s injectors.\n\n""If you have your choice, you want to get poked with a needle or you want to try this? Most of the people say, \'Yeah, I\'ll try that,\' "" he says.\n\nCost remains an issue for some jet injectors. Portal is aiming to get its cost down to $3 or $4 per injection.\n\n""In vaccines, what\'s really hard is that there\'s a very, very high volume, and you\'re competing with a needle and syringe, which is tremendously low cost,"" Anquetil says.\n\nPharmaJet says the ability to give precise doses helps to save money. The company says its flu vaccine ""starter kit,"" which can vaccinate 500 people, costs $900.\n\nNasal spray hits a roadblock\n\nFluMist, an FDA-approved flu vaccine delivered through a nasal spray, was widely used in the U.S. and, at one point, was even the preferred method of vaccination for children.\n\nThen last year, in a sharp turnaround, the CDC recommended that it not be used during the 2016-17 flu season after a study found it had not been very effective in the previous year, particularly among kids.\n\nThe vaccine\'s effectiveness was just 3 percent, so low that ""no protective benefit could be measured"" for children ages 2 to 17, the CDC said in a statement.\n\nIn contrast, the effectiveness of the flu shot was about 63 percent for kids in that age group.\n\nAstraZeneca, the parent company behind FluMist, says the CDC\'s data contradicts data from several other studies, which show the vaccine was about 48 percent effective during the same flu season. And the same vaccine continues to be recommended and used in European Union markets, AstraZeneca says.\n\nIn the U.S., the CDC continues to recommend against the nasal spray vaccine for the upcoming flu season. AstraZeneca hopes to reverse that decision before flu season begins.\n\n""We continue to pursue a broad-based investigation to identify potential causes of lower effectiveness"" in recent years, the company said in a statement, adding that one of the four flu virus strains it used in the vaccine during the past two flu seasons may have been the problem.\n\nThe company has chosen a new strain of live virus that is similar to other strains that have proven effective in studies and clinical trials.']",We also think the story would have been stronger with an independent viewpoint.,"This story summarizes three different alternatives to the classic needle-and-syringe delivery method for vaccinations.
The story does some things well; it discusses price and effectiveness for some of the options under research. But there were some holes in the story when it came to discussing the medical evidence–and its limitations. We also think the story would have been stronger with an independent viewpoint.

For women, might aspirin also help prevent breast cancer?\n\nThis study\n\nThe researchers analyzed data on 57,164 women, most in their early 60s, who had no history of breast cancer. About 23 percent of the women reported taking a low-dose aspirin (81 milligrams), 18 percent took ibuprofen, 11 percent took full-strength aspirin (325 mg) and about 10 percent took a COX-2 inhibitor or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). All were taking the medication at least three times a week.\n\nOver seven years, 1,457 women got a breast-cancer diagnosis. Those taking low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely to have developed any type of breast cancer, compared with women who took no NSAID. They were 20 percent less likely to have developed the most common type: breast cancer that is hormone-receptor-positive and HER2-negative. The study did not find similar links between regular-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs and the risk for breast cancer.\n\n[Certain adults should take a daily baby aspirin, expert panel says]\n\nWho may be affected?\n\nWomen. About 1 of every 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point. Those who take a daily low-dose aspirin, also called a baby aspirin, usually do so to prevent cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death for women older than 25. Aspirin has been shown to help keep blood from clotting, which can help prevent heart attacks and ischemic stroke (the type caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain). However, aspirin can increase the risk for internal bleeding, so women should talk with their doctors before starting a low-dose aspirin regimen, for any reason.\n\nCaveats\n\nThe researchers suggested that the difference in results between low- and regular-dose aspirin may have been attributable to most women taking low-dose aspirin more often than three times a week, even daily, for cardiovascular protection as opposed to more-sporadic use of regular-dose aspirin for pain relief. Hormone therapy and alcohol use were more prevalent among the participants than normal; both are considered risk factors for breast cancer and may have affected the results. Data on aspirin and other NSAID usage came from the women’s responses on questionnaires.

The story notes that regular use of low doses of aspirin may reduce the risk of breast cancer in women. Or it may not, we would like to add.
That’s an important qualifier, since it is impossible to know whether the aspirin affected breast cancer risk based on this study. That’s because this was an observational study — meaning that it could detect a correlation between aspirin use and breast cancer, but not whether the use of aspirin was actually responsible for lower rates of breast cancer. That’s a key distinction, and we wish the story had explained it explicitly. That said, this story addresses the issue more successfully than a related news release, which we reviewed earlier. The story also does a better job of addressing potential harms.

If these results are confirmed in future trials, this approach could be an alternative to heart transplant for patients without any other options,"" she added.\n\nMancini presented the results Monday at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association (AHA) in Chicago.\n\nThe gene for SERCA2a raises levels of the enzyme back to where the heart can pump more efficiently. The enzyme regulates calcium cycling, which, in turn, is involved in how well the heart contracts, the researchers said.\n\n""Heart failure is a defect in contractility related to calcium cycling,"" explained Dr. Robert Eckel, past president of the AHA and professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Denver.\n\nThe study authors hope that, if replicated in larger trials, the gene-therapy treatment could actually delay or obviate the need for heart transplants in patients with heart failure.\n\n""There are a lot of treatments for heart failure but at some point patients stop responding and then the prognosis is poor,"" said Dr. Rita Redberg, AHA spokeswoman and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. After that, the only option is a transplant.\n\nFor this phase 2 study, 39 patients with advanced heart failure were randomly chosen to receive either the gene therapy (through cardiac catheterization) or a placebo.\n\nAt both six months and a year later, the patients who had received the new gene saw their risk for death, cardiac transplantation, worsening heart failure and hospitalization decline by half.\n\nResults were even more heartening at higher doses, where participants had an 88 percent decrease in risk for death, cardiac transplant, hospitalizations and other outcomes, the study authors said.\n\nRedberg cautioned that the study was still preliminary and ""requires more investigation.""\n\nAnd research presented at meetings isn\'t subjected to the same level of scrutiny as studies published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThe study was funded by the Celladon Corp. of La Jolla, Calif.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on heart failure.']","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">There are two serious problems with this story.

Are we really going to report commonly now when early research moves from one phase into another? What researchers announced was that a year after a very small number of heart failure patients were given a type of gene therapy intended to improve how their heart muscles manage calcium cycling there appear to be enough indications of relative benefits and safety to move ahead to a phase 3 trial that would be capable of providing more reliable evidence of clinical effects. What’s more, the key conclusions of this trial were announced at another heart failure meeting last summer. This presentation just updated the statistics with a few more months of data.
Instead of asking probing questions of researchers, the story relies on quotes from a news release. Instead of getting comments from independent sources that illuminate the specific strengths and weaknesses of this trial, the story just passes along general statements about heart failure and the preliminary nature of research.
At least the story discloses the use of prepared statements and it notes that the company developing this gene therapy funded the trial.

She has tried alternative therapies and medication to cope with her symptoms.\n\n“It wasn’t effective. Some side effects would be headaches or stomachache,” she told CBS News.\n\nThen three years ago, she decided to try something different after hearing about a study testing Botox to treat depression.\n\nWhile Botox is commonly used for cosmetic purposes, doctors say the reasoning behind the treatment for depression may not be what you expect.\n\n“We don’t believe it has anything to do with looks,” says researcher Dr. Eric Finzi of Chevy Chase Cosmetic Center.\n\nRather, he says it’s because facial expressions are part of the circuit of the brain related to mood.\n\n“Fear, anger and sadness — all go through this muscle,” Finzi told CBS News, pointing out the area between the eyebrows where frown lines appear. “So Botox basically inhibits the muscle and calms it down, so it becomes more difficult to feel those negative emotions.”\n\nThe makers of Botox recently announced plans for the final phase of testing it as a treatment for depression. Finzi notes previous studies show between 50 to 60 percent of patients may benefit from the treatment.\n\n“Our hope is eventually it will form a place as one of the tools to treat depression,” he said.\n\nBotox is a prescription drug that blocks nerve signals to muscles in the injection area. Its effects are temporary and typically wear off after three months. Botox is currently FDA approved for cosmetic use to lessen frown lines, and for medical use to treat a number of conditions including chronic migraines, bladder incontinence, excessive underarm perspiration, and certain types of neck pain and eye issues. Costs vary widely, but the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery said the average price for a Botox treatment in 2016 was $376.\n\nResearchers are also studying whether Botox can treat social anxiety and bipolar disorder.\n\nAs for Cooke, she said she noticed a change in her depression almost immediately.\n\n“I found overall my mood was better on a day-to-day basis,” she said. “I had less problems with depression.”\n\nEven though the study she took part in is now over, she said she will continue to get Botox injections.']","Relying on just one expert source invites trouble, particularly when the source has multiple ties to the intervention and stands to gain financially from its approval.","This CBS news story describes a possible mechanism by which botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) treatments could be an effective treatment for major depression. It cites a dermatologist who explains the possibility of a feedback loop between the facial muscles that express emotion and the amygdala in the brain. It suggests that botox may offer hope for treating not only depression, but also social anxiety and bipolar disorder.
However, the only evidence this story provides is a single anecdote by an army veteran. The only expert it cites is a dermatologist who stands to gain financially if the treatment receives FDA approval, and who has been a paid consultant for the company manufacturing the drug.
Like Allergan’s news release on a recently completed phase 2 trial of botox for depression (which the CBS story doesn’t mention) the article also omitted any specific description of the benefit, harms, alternative treatments for major depression and how botox might compare with them. The CBS story does, however, provide readers with a cost reference, something the release didn’t do.
It should also be noted that this single anecdote story ended with a quote from that one patient.  Coincidentally, today, at the Association of Health Care Journalists annual conference, this advice was given by a veteran journalist and academic Jacqui Banaszynski: “Be careful if you end a story with a quote because whoever you give the last quote to you give the story to.” Be careful, because this tends to bias the reader’s perception, as this story may have done.

A recent study reported that children who possessed genetic variants on chromosome 17q21 had an increased risk of developing wheeze, when combined with certain environmental exposures.\n\nIt is already known that environmental factors have a modifying effect on specific genetic risk, so the aim of this new study was to find out whether this could also be true for breastfeeding and this specific gene related to asthma with the respect to respiratory symptoms in early infancy.\n\n368 infants from the Basel-Bern Infant Lung Development birth cohort in Switzerland were included in the study. Researchers collected data on occurrence and severity of respiratory symptoms, breastfeeding status and genotyping was performed.\n\nFindings revealed that during the weeks that infants were breastfed, those carrying the asthma risk genotypes, had a 27% decreased relative risk of developing respiratory symptoms. When infants were not breastfed, those carriers exhibited a trend towards an increased risk of respiratory symptoms.\n\nDr Gorlanova said: ""As research in this field progresses, we are understanding more and more about the gene-environment interaction for the development of asthma. Our study sheds light on how this interaction can be modified by breastfeeding.

A new study finds that kids in the U.S. preschool program tend to have a healthier weight by kindergarten than similarly aged kids not in the program.\n\nIn their first year in Head Start, obese and overweight kids lost weight faster than two comparison groups of children who weren\'t in the program, researchers found. Similarly, underweight kids bulked up faster.\n\n""Participating in Head Start may be an effective and broad-reaching strategy for preventing and treating obesity in United States preschoolers,"" said lead researcher Dr. Julie Lumeng, an associate professor at the University of Michigan Center for Human Growth and Development.\n\nFederally funded Head Start, which is free for 3- to 5-year-olds living in poverty, helps children prepare for kindergarten. The program is designed to build stable family relationships, improve children\'s physical and emotional well-being and develop strong learning skills.\n\nHealth benefits, including weight loss, seem to be a byproduct of the program, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center.\n\n""This paper importantly suggests that some of the best strategies for controlling weight and promoting health may have little directly to do with either,"" said Katz, who wasn\'t involved in the study.\n\nHead Start might provide a structured, supervised routine that\'s lacking in the home, Katz suggested. ""Perhaps the program fosters better mental health in the children, which in turn leads to better eating,"" he said.\n\n""Whatever the exact mechanisms, by fostering well-being in one way, we tend to foster it in others, even unintended,"" Katz said. ""The essence of this study is the holistic nature of social, psychological and physical health.""\n\nAlmost one-quarter of preschool-aged children in the United States are overweight or obese, and obesity rates within Head Start populations are higher than national estimates, the study authors noted. Because obesity in childhood tends to continue into adulthood, experts worry that these children are at risk of future health problems.\n\nFor the study, Lumeng\'s team collected data on more than 43,700 Michigan preschool-age children between 2005 and 2013. More than 19,000 were in Head Start. Information on the others -- 5,400 of whom were on Medicaid, the publicly financed insurance program for the poor -- came from two primary health care groups. Whether those children were in another preschool program wasn\'t stated.\n\nAt the study\'s start, about one-third of the Head Start kids were obese or overweight, compared to 27 percent of those on Medicaid and less than 20 percent of kids not on Medicaid.\n\n""Even though children in the Head Start group began the observation period more obese, equally overweight, and moreunderweight than children in the comparison groups, at the end of the observation period the initially obese and overweight Head Start children were substantially less obese andoverweight than the children in the comparison groups,"" the authors wrote.\n\nLumeng said an emphasis on good nutrition and exercise may partly explain the perceived Head Start advantage.\n\n""Head Start programs must adhere to specific dietary guidelines,"" she said. ""The children may be served healthier meals at Head Start than other children.""\n\nIn addition, Head Start requires a certain amount of active play each day, Lumeng said. ""Thus, children attending Head Start may be getting more opportunities for physical activity than other children,"" she explained.\n\nThe daily routine might translate into less TV time and more regular sleep schedules, she said. ""We know that better sleep is linked with less obesity,"" she added.\n\n""It [also] may be that when kids go to Head Start, it reduces stress in the household and frees up time and resources at home to dedicate to healthier eating patterns,"" she noted.\n\nThe report was published Jan. 12 online in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on childhood obesity, visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.']","By the end of the study reported on here, the “Head Start children were substantially less obese and overweight than the children in the comparison groups,” this story notes. But was it an apples-to-apples comparison?","This story is about a study comparing how fast heavy children normalized their weight in the Head Start program compared with low-income children who were recruited from primary care clinics and whose participation in Head Start or other preschool programs was unknown. The comparison group children were sorted into two groups: those with Medicaid and those without Medicaid insurance. The Head Start children were not similarly classified. The number of obese children was much higher in the Medicaid compared with non-Medicaid children, and the story should have questioned why the Medicaid/non-Medicaid distinction was not applied to the Head Start kids as well. Unfortunately, this issue was not addressed. In addition, only 12 out of 51 (23.5%) of the eligible Head Start programs chose to participate in the study. Therefore, it is not clear how representative the conclusions are about Head Start as a whole.
In short, the story overlooked significant limitations in the study: missing data (Medicaid status of Head Start kids), a retrospective/observational study design, and non-random selection of a few Head Start programs. It gives readers an inflated sense of the strength and importance of the findings.

A nick of the skin, a flash of cold and 25 minutes on an exam table. For thousands of women, this may soon replace surgery as a treatment for breast cancer.\n\nCryoablation, using extreme cold to destroy diseased cells, is potentially the first ever procedure to treat breast cancer tumors without the trauma of surgery. Following numerous limited studies, a growing number of women are now being treated with the technique as part of a groundbreaking clinical trial involving leading breast cancer specialists across the country. Utilizing IceCure Medical\'s innovative IceSense3™ cryoablation system, the multi-center trial is examining cryoablation of certain types of breast cancer. Potentially, it will usher in a new and gentler pathway for the treatment of a disease that affects one in every eight women annually.\n\nThe benefits of cryoablation over traditional breast cancer surgery are significant. The procedure is typically performed in a physician\'s office under ultrasound guidance in less than 30 minutes. It involves a small incision and placement of an IceSense3™ nitrogen-cooled probe into the center of a tumor to freeze it from the inside out. The diseased cells then crack open and die. Eventually they are absorbed by the immune system and new cells take their place.\n\nBy contrast, surgical cancer removal often means several hours in the operating room, complications of general anesthesia and weeks or months of recovery. Surgery also typically involves significant breast tissue damage and disfigurement due to large incisions and removal of sizable breast mass.\n\nCryoablation, however, precisely targets the tumor site and involves insertion of only a slim probe. Therefore, it boasts fast recovery time, significantly improved cosmetic results and greater patient comfort overall. In fact, most women are able to resume normal activities almost immediately following treatment. They experience minimal scarring and excellent cosmetic results.\n\nPhysicians participating in the trial report that patients feel minimal discomfort and can watch the procedure on the ultrasound screen. Most are extremely relieved to avoid painful, disfiguring surgery and long recovery times.\n\n""For women with certain types of breast cancer, cryoablation is showing promise as an alternative to surgery, particularly for patients over age 65,"" says Susan K. Boolbol, MD, Chief of the Appel-Venet Comprehensive Breast Service, Mount Sinai Beth Israel, who is participating in the trial. ""For older patients the risks associated with invasive procedures and general anesthesia as well as the discomfort of long recoveries also makes this procedure particularly desirable. As our understanding of tumor biology grows, the ability to offer treatment options other than surgery is important.""\n\n""There is growing awareness treatment should be based on individual tumor biology. We are excited to be participating in this trial where some breast cancer patients can be treated without surgery,"" adds Richard Fine, MD, The West Comprehensive Breast Center, Memphis, TN, another surgeon active in the cryoablation trial. ""Over the next 15 years, women 65 and older will make up one of the fastest growing populations diagnosed with breast cancer. We are confident that the ICE3 trial can prove certain women can be successfully treated less aggressively than in the past. The option of a non-surgical treatment has significant benefits for patients and the overall health care system.""\n\nCryoablation is well-established in the treatment of liver, kidney, prostate and other cancers. Its effectiveness in breast cancer has been proven in a number of smaller studies, including a recent American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) trial and extensive long-term ongoing, unpublished studies in Japan. The ICE3 trial, which began patient enrollment in October 2014, will significantly expand data on the technique as a treatment for breast cancer. Patents will be followed for five years to ensure they remain cancer free.\n\nDeveloped by IceCure Medical (Caesarea, Israel/Memphis, TN), specifically for breast applications, the IceSense3 Cryoablation System™, has a long history of successful treatment of benign breast fibroadenomas. The ongoing refinement of the technology makes treatment more precise and extremely reliable. The IceSense3™ device delivers a stable cycle of extremely cold temperatures and relies on a maneuverable, disposable probe and compact high tech console. For the first time, these advances make precise targeting of tumors extremely reliable.\n\nThe ICE3 trial is recruiting and following women aged 65 years and older diagnosed with certain tumor sub-types and measuring less than 1.5 centimeters in diameter. Developed by a diverse, esteemed scientific advisory board, the trial is underway at 20 carefully selected sites throughout the United States. As a market leader in cryoablation treatment of breast disease, IceCure will utilize its resources to provide clinical and technological support to sites in the cancer trial.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nWilliam Irby\n\n901-237-4630\n\nwirby@icecure-medical.com\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151026/280497\n\nSOURCE IceCure Medical']",C,"This news release plays up a liquid nitrogen-based procedure for treating breast cancer, called IceSense3 (ICE3). The probe is inserted into the breast via a small incision, guided into the middle of a tumor, and pumped with liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill the cancerous lesion from the inside out. This allows the body to naturally dismantle and get rid of the dead tissue — no major surgery required and it lasts less than 30 minutes, we’re told. And it’s stated (over and over again) how “minimal” the procedure is, plus the “excellent cosmetic results” it has, since it can get rid of cancers that would otherwise call for disfiguring breast surgeries and mastectomies. The technology is described as a new-and-improved version of a cryoablation method used to treat “liver, kidney, prostate and other cancers.” But the release offers no hard numbers of efficacy of those treatments, nor does it make any meaningful comparison as to how good they are compared to surgery. Unless the reader is a clinician or very well-informed patient, ICE3 could come off sounding like a magical cure-all. The reality is that no treatment is foolproof, and there are also other uncomfortable treatments that precede and/or follow surgery — radiation therapy and chemotherapy being the two principles ones. At its core, the release is a sales pitch intended to recruit women recently diagnosed with breast cancer into a clinical trial for ICE3, since how well the procedure treats breast cancer is an unknown. But the pitch falls short. Describing the efficacy of cryoablation compared to surgery, even with other types of cancers, would have made this a much stronger, more balanced, and more convincing release. So would have describing typical follow-up radiation and chemotherapy treatments.

After age and sex, the two best predictors of whether the patient would be alive in ten years was how highly activated their metabolism was and how fast their heart would beat during the test.\n\nMetabolism was calculated using ""metabolic equivalent of tasks"" or METs, a measure of how much energy someone expends during a task. The higher MET level achieved, the more likely it was the subject would last another decade.\n\nThe closer someone came to reaching their maximum heart rate as they ran, the less likely they were to die within ten years, compared to someone who only reached about 85 percent of their maximum heart rate during the test. Maximum heart rate was determined by subtracting the subject’s age from 220, a formula that’s been used for decades by exercisers and doctors alike.\n\nDr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News medical contributor, explained the science behind the test on ""Good Morning America.""\n\n“In medicine we usually base predictions of survival on the absence or presence of a disease state,” she said. “What’s new here is that there is now a fancy equation doctors can use to compare the chances of survival for one 50-year-old woman against another 50-year-old woman.”\n\nRather than being viewed as morbid, experts should be able to use this information to motivate people to change their behavior, Ashton said. Everyone can improve their survival score by exercising more often and pushing it a little harder when they do, she added.\n\n“This is in your power to change and improve your numbers. You can actually change your own destiny,” she said.']",This story describes a new way to calculate mortality risk from a treadmill test as a silver bullet that can save lives in minutes at no cost and no risk. ,"Encouraging people to exercise more (and eat a more healthful diet) makes a lot of sense, but this story oversimplified the implications of this study. It would have benefited from a fuller discussion of the risks of unnecessary screening tests, an explanation of the costs and the expertise required to correctly do this test, a true comparison of alternatives, and a better analysis of the quality of the evidence.

""That\'s the great thing about proton therapy.""\n\nWhile proton therapy is a giant step forward, it\'s not yet the magic bullet that clinicians are looking for. So far, it is not effective against all types of cancer.\n\n""There are a number of cancers which are not localized,"" he said. ""If you look at leukemia, which is cancer of the blood cells, there is nowhere to shoot -- it\'s all through the body.""\n\nThe other drawback is that the cyclotron is not cheap.\n\nEach system -- and the bunker needed to house it -- doesn\'t leave much change from $125 million. Currently there are just 43 operational particle therapy facilities worldwide , with a total of 121 treatment rooms.\n\nAs the fame of the process has started to spread, some people have been taking desperate measures to get treatment. One British couple last year even sparked an international manhunt after they removed their son from hospital without doctors\' permission to get to a proton center in Prague in the Czech Republic.\n\nProton treatment is limited on Britain\'s National Health Service. Just one center in the north of the country offers proton therapy for certain types of eye tumors. Other centers, however, are currently in development.\n\nYves Jongen\n\nWhile the proton therapy market is expected to more than double by 2018, with an estimated 300 proton therapy rooms, Jongen\'s Brussels-based company IBA is working on a smaller and cheaper model they hope will make proton therapy more accessible.\n\n""It would be much less expensive making it more possible for a hospital to afford it -- a smaller system can already treat a relatively large number of patients per year.""\n\nAt the moment, fewer than 1% of cancer patients are treated with proton therapy, but Jongen is hopeful that smaller and cheaper machines will be the game changer.\n\n""I have a number of letters from parents of young kids saying if it had not been for this treatment we would have lost our kid,"" he said.\n\n""That\'s something I really cherish.

Now a study published in the journal Circulation confirms and quantifies that benefit; women who ate three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries per week reduced their risk of heart attack by up to one third.\n\nIn the study, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of East Anglia in the U.K. analyzed data from 93,600 women ages 25 to 42 enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study II. For 18 years, the women filled out surveys detailing their diets at four-year intervals.\n\n(MORE: Study: Flavonoids May Help Protect Against Parkinson’s)\n\nDuring the study the women experienced 405 heart attacks. But women who consumed the most blueberries and strawberries had a 32% reduced risk of heart attack compared with the women who ate berries once a month or less. The women who ate more berries also tended to eat healthier overall, consuming more vegetables and fruits than those who didn’t eat as many berries; but when the scientists broke down the women’s diets, they found that the highest consumers of berries even had a lower risk of heart attack compared with women who still ate plenty of fruits and vegetables but fewer berries. The effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart-disease risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease.\n\n“These foods can be readily incorporated into diets, and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women,” says study author Aedin Cassidy from the University of East Anglia. “This supports growing lab data showing that these compounds can help keep arteries healthy and flexible.”\n\nSo what is it about berries that help the heart? The researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the U.S. Both berries contain high levels of anthocyanins, as well as other flavonoids, which fight the effects of stress and free-radical damage to cells as they age. They can also keep heart vessels more elastic and flexible, which helps combat the growth of plaques that can build up and rupture, causing heart attacks.\n\n(MORE: Can Eating Fruits and Veggies Outwit Bad Heart Genes?)\n\nThe results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart-disease risk for relatively young women. That means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman’s risk of having a heart attack later in life, possibly even insulating her from heart problems. “Although we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids, and their effects in wine and chocolate, it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time,” says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. “The take-home lesson is that even if you are eating these early in life, you’re getting benefits that last for life. When we’re making choices in our 20s, we may think that a burger and fries is great, but the message is that there are alternatives that make a difference for the rest of your life. It is a powerful message that we can prevent cardiovascular disease by what we eat.” Something worth remembering the next time you’re in the produce aisle.']",Better than ,"This story did a good job of explaining how researchers adjusted for different dietary and lifestyle variables among study participants.
However, many things are never discussed. There’s no mention of harms, costs, alternatives and study limitations. It does provide some minimal context on prior anthocyanin research.
The NPR story did a far better job explaining clearly: “It’s certainly not a perfect way to detect how certain foods may influence health, but it identifies important associations.”
This story’s quote – “Now a study published in the journal Circulation confirms and quantifies that benefit” – makes the research finding appear to be definitive. This is a troublingly misleading line.

The study, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, argues that current medical guidelines haven\'t adequately considered the risks from these widely used drugs.\n\n""Some harms are mentioned, but it\'s entirely unclear how they were considered when coming up with the recommendations,"" says Milo Puhan, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Zurich and senior author of the new study. ""In our approach we very explicitly considered the harms.""\n\nIt\'s important to note that statin drugs are generally safe, and harms are uncommon. On the other hand, the benefits aren\'t that great, either. Anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years, so even small harms may outweigh the potential benefits, the Swiss scientists say.\n\nThe most common side effect of these drugs is muscle pain, which usually goes away if patients stop taking the medicines. People taking statins are also at a higher risk of developing diabetes, which is harder to reverse.\n\nPuhan also found that some statins were more effective than others, with atorvastatin (the generic name for Lipitor) being the best of the bunch. He notes that physician guidelines don\'t generally compare the relative value of these drugs, which are all available as inexpensive generics.\n\nHe also finds that benefits fade compared with harms as people get older. ""The elderly do not benefit as much as previous studies might have thought,"" he says.\n\n""One size doesn\'t fit it all,"" he concludes. ""That\'s a very important message.""\n\nPuhan says, based on his assessment, perhaps 15 to 20 percent of older adults should be taking statins – far less than the 30 or 40 percent suggested by current medical guidelines.\n\n""I think for me, as a physician,"" says Ilana Richman, an internist at the Yale School of Medicine, ""this kind of data suggests that if we give more weight to the potential for adverse events, then maybe it\'s reasonable to hold off for lower-risk patients.""\n\nShe co-wrote an editorial about the paper and came away from it thinking that doctors need to spend more time talking about the plusses and minuses of statin treatment, personalizing their recommendations more than they do now. She says it\'s a challenge to convey these sophisticated concepts in the short amount of time doctors have to spend with their patients.\n\nYet that kind of dialog is increasingly the expectation. In mid-November, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology published new guidelines calling for more nuanced conversations around who would most benefit from statins.\n\nScott Grundy, a physician at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center who chaired the guidelines committee, says the new recommendations urge people in this gray area to get a special kind of CT scan that looks for calcium deposits in heart arteries, a signal for clogs that could cause trouble.\n\n""If you have no coronary calcium, then your chances of having a heart attack over the next 10 years are very low,"" he says.\n\nAnd it turns out that perhaps 40 percent of people who are identified as candidates based on their risk factors such as cholesterol levels and age actually have clear heart arteries, Grundy says. ""That means a lot of people are going to be treated unnecessarily if they don\'t have the calcium scan.""\n\nBut that test, which Grundy says is available for about $100, is controversial among some physicians. They worry that it will trigger overtreatment of conditions that the scan will pick up, but which don\'t require urgent attention.\n\nAnd it is only useful as a screening test for people who haven\'t had heart disease. Statins are routinely prescribed for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke. For those patients (who weren\'t included in the Swiss analysis), the benefits are so clear ""it\'s almost mandatory to be on a statin drug,"" Grundy says.\n\nHe disagrees with a lot of the particulars in the Swiss study. So does cardiologist Roger Blumenthal, who heads the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins. ""The harms [analyzed in the paper] can be dealt with by a smart clinician,"" he says.\n\nYet both the new guidelines and the latest study agree on an important point: Doctors and patients should spend more time reviewing the benefits and risks of statins, with attention paid to each person\'s particular circumstances.\n\nYou can contact NPR science correspondent Richard Harris at rharris@npr.org.']","This story could have provided a bit more on costs, alternatives, and how this study was performed.","The story reports on a study that re-assessed who benefits from taking a statin to prevent heart disease, with different risk thresholds based on sex, age group, and statin type.
It reports the view that current guidelines “haven’t adequately considered” the harms from taking these widely used drugs.
The story laudably focuses attention on potential adverse events and a need for balanced decision-making. It also incorporated a variety of sources. In our view, the story could done a better job in discussing costs, the quality of evidence, and alternative strategies to prevent heart disease.

In just five days, all 18 people fully recovered. This small but stunningly successful trial offers hope to address the growing problem of drug-resistant malaria.\n\nDetails of the cases are documented in the paper ""Artemisia annua dried leaf tablets treated malaria resistant to ACT and i.v. artesunate: case reports"" by an international team lead by Pamela Weathers, PhD, professor of biology and biotechnology at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), who has pioneered the use of dried leaves of Artemisia annua (DLA) as a malaria therapy.\n\n""To our knowledge, this is the first report of dried-leaf Artemisia annua controlling ACT-resistant malaria in humans,"" the authors of the Phytomedicine paper note, adding that more comprehensive clinical trials on patients with drug-resistant malaria are warranted. ""Successful treatment of all 18 ACT-resistant cases suggests that DLA should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for Africa,"" they added, ""and possibly wherever else ACT resistance has emerged.""\n\nWatch a video about research at WPI related to this study.\n\nThe report documents the experiences of 18 patients in the North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo who showed symptoms of malaria and were originally treated with the recommended medication: artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), which blends artemisinin, a chemical extract from Artemisia annua, with one or more other drugs that attack the malaria parasite in different ways.\n\nThe 18 patients, ranging in age from 14 months to 60 years, did not respond to the standard ACT treatment, and all lapsed into severe malaria, defined by symptoms that can include loss of consciousness, respiratory distress, convulsions, and pulmonary edema. One patient, a five-year-old child, became comatose. All were then treated with intravenously administered artesunate, the frontline medication for severe malaria, but again they showed no improvement.\n\nAs a last resort, doctors turned to dried-leaf Artemisia (DLA), a therapy developed and extensively studied by Weathers and her team at WPI. After five days of treatment with tablets made from only the dried and powered leaves of Artemisia (which has been prepared and analyzed using methods developed by Weathers and postdoctoral fellow Melissa Towler), all 18 patients fully recovered. Laboratory tests showed they had no parasites remaining in their blood. (Weathers noted more than 100 other drug-resistant patients also have been successfully treated with DLA tablets.)\n\n""These 18 patients were dying,"" Weathers said. ""So to see 100 percent recover, even the child who had lapsed into a coma, was just amazing. It\'s a small study, but the results are powerful.""\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 212 million people contracted malaria in 2015 and some 429,000 died, with young children and pregnant women being particularly vulnerable. Caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, the illness is reported in nearly 100 countries and threatens nearly half of the world\'s population. ACT, the current recommended therapy, is expensive to produce and is in short supply in areas hit hardest by the disease. In addition, while the combination therapy is designed to be less prone to the drug resistance that has rendered previous antimalarial agents ineffective, increasingly the malaria parasite is showing signs of resistance to ACT, particularly in Southeast Asia.\n\nWeathers began her research on artemisinin and Artemesia annua (also known as sweet wormwood) more than 25 years ago. In recent years, she has turned her attention to the use of DLA as an alternative to conventional antimalarial drugs. Noting that Artemisia annua, which is classified as a generally regarded as safe (GRAS) herb, has been consumed by humans and used as an herbal therapy for thousands of years, often in the form of a tea, she became intrigued by the potential for using the dried plant, rather than just a chemical extract, as a malaria treatment. A study she published in Photochemistry Reviews in 2011 was the first to demonstrate that dried leaves of the Artemisia annua plant delivers 40 times more artemisinin to the blood than does the drug based on the chemical extract of the plant.\n\nIn a paper published in PLOS ONE the following year, Weathers and her team showed that not only does DLA have antimalarial properties, it is more effective in knocking out the parasite and reduced the level of parasite infection more completely in mice. In a 2015 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the WPI researchers, with colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, showed that dried Artemisia leaves cured rodents infected with malaria strains that were known to be resistant to artemisinin. And, in an experiment that accelerated the evolution of the malaria parasite by passing it through up to 49 generations of mice, the parasite showed no signs of resistance to DLA.\n\nWeathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plant\'s leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs.\n\n""We have done a lot of work to understand the biochemistry of these compounds, which include a number of flavonoids and terpenes, so we can better understand the role they play in the pharmacological activity of the dried leaves,"" Weathers said. ""The more we learn, the more excited we become about the potential for DLA to be the medication of choice for combatting malaria worldwide. Artemisia annua is known to be efficacious against a range of other diseases, including other tropical maladies and certain cancers, so in our lab we are already at work investigating the effectiveness of DLA with other diseases.""\n\nAnother advantage of DLA over conventional malaria treatments is its low cost and the relative simplicity of its manufacture, Weathers said. While the processes for manufacturing ACT is costlier and requires a higher degree of expertise, producing DLA tablets can be accomplished with simpler equipment and a modest amount of training. Growing Artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets, Weathers noted, are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy.\n\nIn fact, she has already established a supply chain in Africa that includes growing and harvesting high-producing cultivars in East Africa, along with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) processing operations in Uganda where the leaves are dried, pulverized, and homogenized, where the powder is compacted into tablets, and where the tablets are tested to verify their dosage.

Gluten is not a carbohydrate; it’s a mix of proteins found in wheat and its close relatives (including spelt, kamut and farro), as well as in barley and rye. It’s what gives bread its elasticity, but it also sets off the immune system of people with celiac disease, damaging the small intestine and sometimes producing painful and unpleasant symptoms.\n\nEven some people who don’t have celiac disease feel better when they don’t eat wheat. They may assume that they have gluten sensitivity, but some researchers believe that it’s not the gluten they’re sensitive to. Instead, it’s fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, or FODMAPS.\n\nNever was a group of molecules more desperately in need of an acronym. FODMAPs are a group of carbohydrates that don’t get broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. Instead, they pass through to the large intestine, where they draw water into the gut and start to ferment. The process by which FODMAPs are broken down and fermented can cause gastrointestinal distress: diarrhea, bloating, pain, flatulence and constipation. Wheat and rye are high in FODMAPs, as are onions, garlic, apples, stone fruit, pistachios and many other foods.\n\nResearch by Peter Gibson, a professor of gastroenterology at Australia’s Monash University, has found that some people who believed they were gluten-sensitive were, instead, FODMAP-sensitive. A low-FODMAP diet eased their symptoms, as it does for about 70 percent of people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, a condition that causes abdominal pain and bowel changes. Gibson estimates that, overall, about 10 percent of the population may be FODMAP-sensitive.\n\nBut there’s a problem with a low-FODMAP diet. The fermentation that is painful to that 10 percent is good for your gut because it stimulates growth of the kind of bacteria associated with digestive health. “Following strictly the low-FODMAP diet is associated with changes in the microbiota that many would not equate with good health,” says Gibson, who stresses that a low-FODMAP diet should be used to reduce specific symptoms, not as a way to improve health.\n\nIf your gut can handle FODMAPs, foods that contain a lot of them can be very good choices — partly because the fermentation helps your gut biome and partly because the way FODMAPs are digested means you’re absorbing fewer calories than indicated on a FODMAP-rich product’s label. Unless you have specific symptoms that a low-FODMAP diet alleviates, Gibson says, “enjoy your FODMAPs!”\n\nFood list\n\nHigh-FODMAPs protein: Legumes\n\nLow-FODMAPs protein: Meat, fish, chicken, tofu\n\nHigh-FODMAPs vegetables : Garlic, onions, asparagus, artichokes, sugar snap peas, celery, sweet corn\n\nLow-FODMAPs vegetables: Green beans, carrots, cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, zucchini\n\nHigh-FODMAPs fruit and nuts : Apples, mangoes, pears, peaches, plums, watermelon, cashews, pistachios\n\nLow-FODMAPs fruit and nuts: Bananas, oranges, grapes, almonds\n\nHigh-FODMAPs cereals, grains, breads, pastas : Wheat products, barley, rye\n\nLow-FODMAPs cereals, grains, breads and pastas : Gluten-free bread and pastas, oats, rice, quinoa\n\nHigh-FODMAPs dairy products: Soft cheeses, cow’s milk, cream, ice cream, yogurt\n\nLow-FODMAPs dairy products: Lactose-free milk and yogurt, hard cheese']",This story has a useful premise: that many people who think they’re gluten sensitive might actually be reacting to a particular type of carbohydrate that causes gas and bloating. We needed a bit more data and detail to be convinced that this premise holds any merit.,"This story raises many questions, perhaps more than it actually answers. We are told that some people who have difficulty with gluten-containing foods may not be suffering from true celiac disease. We are also provided with a list of foods with both high and low levels of a type of carbohydrate known as a “FODMAP.” But that is just about where the information ends. The research referred to is not well described, and the story doesn’t do an effective job of quantifying the benefits of a low-FODMAP diet. The single source for the story is one of the developers of the FODMAP diet and is an author of a book on the topic.
Though it would’ve benefited from more specifics, the story is careful not to make overly broad recommendations about the value of a low-FODMAP diet, and that’s something we genuinely appreciate. As we’ve seen with the recent gluten craze, people are more than willing to restrict their diets in the pursuit of better health. But diets that are too restrictive can be harmful, especially for growing children who need a variety of nutrients. This story is at least clear that FODMAPS are not something that most of us need to worry about.

Published early online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, the findings may help resolve controversies over soy\'s potential link to breast cancer outcomes.\n\nSoy foods are considered among the healthiest for human consumption, but their estrogen-like properties have raised concerns of a potential increased risk of breast cancer. This is because in hormone receptor-positive cancer, the most common form of the disease, there are some concerns that high estrogen levels help cancer cells grow and spread, though this remains controversial.\n\n""Isoflavones--the component of soy that has estrogen-like properties--have been shown to slow the growth of breast cancer cells in laboratory studies, and epidemiological analyses in East Asian women with breast cancer found links between higher isoflavone intake and reduced mortality; however, other research has suggested that the estrogen-like effects of isoflavones may reduce the effectiveness of hormone therapies used to treat breast cancer,"" explained Fang Fang Zhang, MD, PhD, of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. ""Because of this disparity, it remains unknown whether isoflavone consumption should be encouraged or avoided for breast cancer patients.""\n\nTo provide some clarity, Dr. Zhang and her colleagues looked at the relationship between dietary intake of isoflavones and death from any cause in 6235 American and Canadian women diagnosed with breast cancer. Over a median follow-up of nine years, women with breast cancer who consumed high amounts of isoflavones had a 21 percent lower risk of dying than women who consumed low amounts. This decrease was largely confined to women with hormone receptor-negative tumors and women who were not treated with anti-estrogen therapy such as tamoxifen (which blocks the effects of estrogen). In contrast to some previous research, high levels of isoflavone intake were not associated with greater mortality among women receiving hormonal therapy.\n\n""Based on our results, we do not see a detrimental effect of soy food intake among women who were treated with endocrine therapy,"" said Dr. Zhang. ""For women with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer, soy food products may potentially have a protective effect. Women who did not receive endocrine therapy as a treatment for their breast cancer had a weaker, but still statistically significant, association.""\n\nMore than 20 percent of all new breast cancer cases with known estrogen and progesterone receptor status are receptor-negative, and they have poorer survival rates than hormone receptor-positive cases. ""Whether lifestyle factors can improve survival after diagnosis is an important question for women diagnosed with this more aggressive type of breast cancer. Our findings suggest that survival may be better in patients with a higher consumption of isoflavones,"" said senior author Esther John, PhD, of the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. The investigators noted that they examined only naturally occurring dietary isoflavones, not isoflavones from supplements.\n\nHow isoflavones from foods interact with breast cancer cells is unclear, but research has shown that they have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and other effects that could influence tumor survival and growth.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Omer Kucuk, MD, of the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, noted that the United States is the number 1 soy producer in the world and is in a great position to initiate changes in health policy encouraging soy intake. ""We now have evidence that soy foods not only prevent breast cancer but also benefit women who have breast cancer. Therefore, we can recommend women to consume soy foods because of soy\'s many health benefits,"" he wrote.\n\n###\n\nAdditional information\n\nNOTE: The information contained in this release is protected by copyright.

An observational study can’t tell you that.,"This news release describes results of a patient survey-based study that examined the association between dietary soy foods and death from any cause among thousands of American and Canadian women with breast cancer.
The release reports that women with breast cancer who ate the highest amounts of isoflavones (a primary active ingredient in soy foods) had a 21 percent lower risk of dying (from any cause, not just breast cancer) over a median nine year follow up period than women who ate the lowest amounts. It offers important details about the hormone-receptor status and treatment of the women to help readers sort out which women with breast cancer might experience the benefits.
It also noted the controversies that have emerged from previous research linking soy intake and breast cancer.  
While the release clearly has its strengths, it would have been stronger had it explicitly stated that nothing in the study demonstrates that eating soy will absolutely prevent breast cancer or extend the life of patients already diagnosed. This was an “association” study and not one designed to determine cause and effect. And the release would have been more useful had it noted the weaknesses found in research based on self reporting through patient surveys of dietary habits.

The study is the first to show that a point-of-care EVD test (ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test; Corgenix) is faster than and as sensitive as a conventional laboratory-based molecular method used for clinical testing during the recent outbreak in Sierra Leone.\n\nThis new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could cut back on the lengthy process usually required to confirm if a patient has EVD, help identify case contacts, and ultimately curb the spread of Ebola.\n\nCurrently, diagnosis of EVD requires a full vial of venous blood to be shipped to a laboratory with a high level of biosafety and staff expertise for testing by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This method poses substantial risks to the healthcare workers responsible for blood collection, transport, and testing, and efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic in west Africa have been hampered by this slow and complex diagnostic test.\n\n""Laboratory results can sometimes take days to return. Delays like this result not only in the failure to diagnose and treat Ebola-infected patients, but also in individuals without Ebola being admitted to holding units where they may be subsequently infected with the virus,"" [1] explains Dr Nira Pollock, senior author and Associate Medical Director of the Infectious Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory at the Boston Children\'s Hospital, USA.\n\n""This new test, on the other hand, is capable of detecting the Ebola virus in just a small drop of blood tested at the bedside, and could help us in the fight against Ebola."" [1]\n\nIn this study, the researchers compared the diagnostic accuracy of the new RDT against the benchmark RT-PCR test (altona Diagnostics) being used for clinical diagnosis in the field reference laboratory run by Public Health England at Port Loko in Sierra Leone.\n\n106 suspected Ebola patients admitted to two treatment centres in Sierra Leone (run by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone and supported by the non-governmental organisation Partners In Health) during February 2015 were tested by both RDT (performed on a fingerstick blood sample at the point-of-care) and by standard RT-PCR (performed on plasma in the laboratory). Both RDT (on whole blood) and RT-PCR (on plasma) were also performed on 284 samples in the laboratory.\n\nThe RDT detected all confirmed cases of EVD that were positive by RT-PCR in both point-of-care (28/105 patients) and laboratory testing (45/277 patients), with sensitivity of 100% (identifying all patients with EVD as per the benchmark method), and a specificity of 92% (identifying patients who didn\'t have EVD).\n\nSurprisingly, the findings also revealed that the standard altona RT-PCR test, under the conditions deployed in the field, was itself an imperfect reference standard. The altona RT-PCR assay failed to detect a small number of EVD cases that tested positive by both RDT and by an alternative RT-PCR test (Trombley), all with relatively low amounts of virus. Both the RDT and altona assays failed to detect a small number of EVD cases that tested positive by the Trombley test, all with very low amounts of virus. The authors caution that given the limitations of the performance of the altona RT-PCR reference test in patients with low levels of the virus in their blood, more research is needed to assess how the new RDT will perform in patients very early in the course of EVD.\n\nAccording to co-author Dr Jana Broadhurst from Partners In Health, Boston, USA, ""This test could have an immediate impact on patient care and infection control by reliably detecting patients well into their illness who are likely to be highly infectious. Earlier test results would improve triage of patients, enabling staff to focus on those most likely to have Ebola, and reducing the opportunity for infection of non-Ebola \'suspects\'. Although the RDT requires refrigeration, this is already available in many health centres in endemic areas, particularly those that store vaccines and other medical products."" [1]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Dr Nahid Bhadelia from Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Boston, USA says, ""[This study] validates the accuracy of the ReEBOV RDT in patients who are well into their illness...suggesting it could be used to triage this subset of patients if RT-PCR is not available, particularly in those with a high index of clinical suspicion for a differential diagnosis...the data presented provide crucial information about the point of-care function of this rapid diagnostic test, such as ease of use, quality of samples taken at the bedside, and the concordance with venous samples...the results raise caution regarding the performance of the widely used altona RT-PCR assay, which the authors suggest might have underperformed because of laboratory specific technical and performance factors.""\n\n###\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS:\n\nThis study was funded by a gift from the Abundance Foundation (Stephen Kahn). Corgenix provided the test kits.\n\n[1] Quotes direct from authors and cannot be found in text of Article.']",A thorough summary of a study describing a new test for Ebola virus that would be faster and more convenient than currently available tests.,"
This release from the The Lancet plays up a first-of-its-kind rapid diagnostic test for Ebola virus disease (EVD). We’re told the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test (made by Corgenix) could be a powerful future tool in detecting, monitoring, and controlling outbreaks of EVD. The excitement stems from a recent field study conducted during an Ebola outbreak. After that trial, the release explains, clinicians found the test to be faster than and as reliable as the current standard method for detecting EVD, called real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The release helpfully quantifies both the sensitivity and specificity of the test, giving readers a thorough overview of the test’s performance both in identifying cases of Ebola and ruling it out in people who don’t have it. What’s more, the release tells us, the new rapid-diagnostic test requires just a drop of blood instead a vial of blood, and takes minutes to get a result instead of days.
The new test sounds like a potentially critical new tool in rapidly diagnosing EVD, but it has strings attached. The release does disclose these caveats — e.g. the test missed some early cases, it requires refrigeration, and it’s ability to detect EVD early on is limited. Our wish list for this otherwise very complete release includes context about how deadly EVD is and how it’s transmitted; what the symptoms are; what regions its endemic to; etc. We’d also like to know a bit about the regulatory side of things — which of these tests have been approved, and what are the roadblocks to approval/bringing the test to the field?

The scanner is based on radiofrequency technology, which is able to quickly show malignant and benign tumors when linked to a computer. It could be used in doctors’ offices.\n\nRadio Waves Radiofrequency or microwave technology for breast cancer detection is not new, but what Zhipeng Wu, PhD, from Manchester’s School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering has achieved is the speed of results and portability. The patented real-time radiofrequency scanner uses computer tomography and works by using the same technology as a mobile phone, but with only a tiny fraction of its power. Costs are reduced and the electronics fit into a case the size of a lunchbox.\n\nBreast Cancer Current mammography testing works well for detecting breast cancer in women over 50 with results of up to 95% accuracy. The Manchester team says it is far less effective for younger women, where the detection rate could be as low as 60% for women under the age of 50. This group, the team says, accounts for 20% of all breast cancer cases.\n\nHow It Works While mammography works on breast density, radiofrequency looks at contrasts between normal and diseased breast tissues. The breast is placed in a scanner cup and an image appears on screen. Tumors or other abnormalities show up in red. Wu says in a news release: “The system we have is portable and as soon as you lie down you can get a scan -- it’s real-time. The real-time imaging minimizes the chance of missing a breast tumor during scanning.” Wu says it will even work through a bra. “Although there is still research to be done, the system has great potential to bring a new way for breast cancer diagnosis.”\n\nReaction Carolyn Rogers, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care in the U.K., says in an emailed statement: “Evidence is needed to demonstrate the accuracy and uses of this device. The most effective screening tool for detecting breast cancer is mammography and for women of all ages to remain breast aware, reporting any changes to their [doctor].”']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">This story is made up of a reworded </span></span>","Nowhere do we hear how far along the research is. The main section doesn’t even allude to evidence, other than to state that more research is to be done, which is true about most everything in medicine except limes for scurvy. As far as a reader can tell, the “new portable scanner” may have yet to leave a laboratory setting. All we know is that it’s been submitted to, and is a finalist for, an engineering & technology award. It’s not the same as clinical research.
The article is quick to point out mammography’s low detection rates (sensitivity, perhaps?) in younger women, identifying the problem to be solved, but it never tells us the detection rates for the new tool. The data very well may be unknown. Which means detection rates could be worse! But from the structure of this article, focusing on technology but not evidence, a reader could only conclude the new kid on the block is superior.
If we’re lucky, the new kid will make the world a better place. But filing a patent for a device is not the same level of proof as clinical research. People would be shocked to learn how many promising ideas from labs and napkins never survive clinical trials, how many prove to be worse for mankind than what we already do. Science is hard and complex. Last year’s uproar over the new mammography guidelines highlighted that there are important subtleties about screening for cancer, and that clear, balanced communication is crucial.
 It may sound like we ask a lot of journalists. But really, asking one more question would’ve turned this story around: How far along is this idea? The answer leads us to look beyond the novelty, beyond the theoretical benefits, beyond the entangled claims of the institution and inventor who stand to benefit, and see, simply, whether this idea is better or worse or needs 4 more years in the oven before we can even ask.

The study, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), appears in the December 28 issue of JAMA Cardiology.\n\nFenofibrate is primarily used to help reduce elevated levels of triglycerides, or fat, in the blood. But the researchers wanted to know if the drug, when combined with statin treatment, could also reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular-related events, such as heart attacks, stroke, and even death, often because their levels of triglycerides are so high, and their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are low.\n\nTo answer their question, the researchers followed 4,640 participants from the NHLBI-funded Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Study for five years after the conclusion of the trial in 2009. The findings suggest that fenofibrate therapy may be beneficial in the way the researchers hoped: by reducing cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who take statins but still have especially high triglycerides levels and low HDL cholesterol levels.

The initial trial covered 4.7 years, during which no benefit was evident; this study followed a subset of patients for another 5 years.

The study was published in SLEEP, the official journal of the Sleep Research Society.\n\nChronic insomnia is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as sleeping poorly at least three nights a week for a month or longer, despite adequate opportunity for a full night\'s sleep. It is ""a significant problem in the military,"" said Taylor, who noted that military personnel often develop insomnia because of rapidly changing schedules and deployments that keep them constantly on alert.\n\nChronic insomnia is a strong risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse, absenteeism and occupational accidents, Taylor said. Treatment of insomnia may not only improve sleep in these soldiers, but also improve these other conditions, he said.\n\n""About 10 percent of deployed military personnel take sleep medications, which are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia in civilian populations. For deployed military personnel, the side effects such as grogginess, slowed cognitive processing and slowed reaction time can be dangerous,"" Taylor said.\n\nOne hundred soldiers at Fort Hood who had chronic insomnia were recruited for Taylor\'s study. All completed one week of sleep monitoring by keeping sleep diaries and wearing activity monitors.\n\nOne third of the participants met with clinicians at Fort Hood for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia once a week for six weeks, while another third received the therapy via the Internet once a week for six weeks. Both the in-person and Internet therapy had the exact same content, with the Internet lessons presented as audio recordings accompanied by visual graphics and animations. A third control group of participants was contacted by the researchers every other week during the six weeks, but did not receive cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nTaylor discovered that the study participants who received in-person cognitive behavioral treatment for their insomnia reported significantly greater improvements in sleep quality -- as determined by the sleep diaries and activity monitors -- than those who received the Internet therapy. Both groups had greater improvements in sleep quality than those who did not receive cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nHe noted that that cognitive behavioral therapy is ""a multifaceted intervention that can be difficult to administer without the benefit of a therapist."" Additional training in the therapy for behavioral health providers in all branches of the military is needed, he said.\n\nIn a previous study of civilians with insomnia, Taylor and his research team discovered that cognitive behavioral therapy led to significant improvements in sleep efficiency, with the research subjects\' use of sleep medication declining from 87.5 percent before therapy to 54 percent afterward, although the subjects weren\'t required to stop taking their medication.\n\nKristi Pruiksma, a STRONG STAR collaborating investigator and clinical psychologist, served as a clinician on Taylor\'s study. She said the benefits of the online therapy include easy access to the treatment and flexibility in times for completing the sessions, which ""is really helpful for those juggling work and family demands.""\n\n""The online program can also be done from home rather than at a military behavioral health clinic, which some service members may avoid due to concerns about stigma,"" said Pruiksma, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).\n\n""Successful treatment has a real impact on patients\' daily lives. An important next step will be to figure out who is able to achieve good benefits from the online program and who is likely to need additional assistance from a therapist,"" she said.\n\n###']",A discussion of cost and study limitations (including the small size of the study) would have made the release much stronger.,"When claiming something is “effective” always have back-up. Researchers at the University of North Texas announced that cognitive behavioral training for insomnia (CBTi) delivered through the internet was more helpful than no CBTi for military personnel, but that in-person therapy was better than both, according to a small randomized study. The release doesn’t put the benefit of the therapy in any context for readers so we can know how much the online training helped — was it a little or a lot? A discussion of cost and study limitations would have made the release much stronger.

REUTERS/Ruben Sprich/File Photo\n\nMixing Tecentriq with Avastin and carboplatin and paclitaxel boosted overall survival in first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Roche said on Monday, compared to patients who received only Avastin plus the two chemotherapies.\n\nThe latest trial success follows Roche’s announcement last week about a separate study in which Tecentriq mixed with chemotherapies carboplatin and Abraxane boosted progression-free survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe Basel-based company, which had previously announced Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy had reduced the risk of disease progression or death, said on Monday it hopes for a quick approval from authorities for the cocktail.\n\nWhile Roche did not provide specific overall survival data, the headline result helps its bid to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shares rose about 1 percent in early trading.\n\n“We are pleased the IMpower150 study demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit for people receiving their initial treatment for this type of advanced lung cancer,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer.\n\nShe also said the survival benefit was observed across key subgroups, including those with varying levels of a protein called PD-L1 that can help tumors avoid detection. This could help Roche make the case that its cocktail is suitable for broad patients groups, not just those with specific biomarkers.\n\nThe world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs is counting on growing sales of Tecentriq, which notched 487 million Swiss francs in 2017, to help offset falling revenue from its older cancer medicines Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin whose patent expirations are exposing them to rivals’ cheaper copies.\n\nAnalysts from Baader Helvea said its announcement completes an “already robust” set of data for regulators who now must sign off on Tecentriq’s use as an initial treatment of lung cancer.\n\n“We continue to see Roche efficacy more than sufficiently competitive to grant a 43 percent market share in the indication, translating in 4.9 billion francs Tecentriq peak sales and 1.2 billion francs in 2018,” Baader’s Bruno Bulic said.\n\n“Facing biosimilar competition... we see Tecentriq sales coming timely to support Roche’s profitability going forward.”']","To its credit, the story makes clear that Roche is going public with such incomplete and at best data-free pronouncements about incremental results in a “bid to catch up” to competitors’ better known immunotherapies.","This article from Reuters is categorized under its “Health News” service, but in both content and reality is a “business and marketing” story about an incremental big pharma clinical trial of cancer immunotherapy drugs that closely follows the format, tone and conclusion of a Roche pharmaceutical news release.
The headline on the story, “Roche’s Tecentriq cocktail adds to lung cancer survival success,”  asks readers to take Roche’s word for it, because neither it nor Roche offers any quantitative data to support the claim. Patients, physicians and the general public will have no idea from the story by how long, to what degree, and with what quality, the drug cocktail — as a first line treatment — extends survival for people with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer; or for that matter anything about the the makeup of the trial in terms of numbers of patients, or their diagnostic and treatment histories.
The story makes clear that the results of this trial of the immunotherapy Tecentriq combined with two chemotherapies, is the latest in a series of studies designed as head-to-head tests of various combinations of cancer treatment cocktails. And to its substantial credit, the story also makes clear that Roche is going public with such incomplete and at best data-free pronouncements about  incremental results in a “bid to catch up” to competitors’ better known immunotherapies and increase its market share of a drug already in use but facing stiff competition. It also reports that the ploy is working: Shares of Roche rose on the news about 1 percent the day the results were reported.

SKIN PATCH AIMS TO TEST SWEAT FOR HEALTH,"['WASHINGTON — Breaking a sweat? Researchers are creating a skin patch that can test those droplets while people exercise and beam results to their smartphones, possibly a new way to track health and fitness.\n\nThe experimental gadget goes well beyond activity monitors like the Fitbit. A little larger than a quarter, it’s almost like a tiny lab stuck to the skin — and a study published Wednesday found it worked on sweaty bicyclists, sticking even during a long-distance race in Arizona.\n\nIf you think of perspiration as just a drippy nuisance, think again.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“Sweat has biochemical components within it that tell us a lot about physiological health,” said John A. Rogers, who directs Northwestern University’s Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics and led the new research.\n\nToday’s wearable technology helps people track their calories, activity and heart rate. A wearable biosensor would be “radically different,” Rogers said.\n\nFor simple fitness purposes, it could give an early warning that it’s time to replenish electrolytes before someone starts to feel dehydrated. But eventually with additional research, Rogers envisions more sophisticated use of such devices, such as real-time monitoring of how the body adjusts during military training, or even to screen people for diseases such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis.\n\nRogers, who did much of the research while at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has long worked to develop electronic devices that can stretch and twist with the body. The skin-like sweat patch adds a capability called microfluidics, capturing and analyzing tiny amounts of body fluid.\n\nHow it works: Stick the patch on the skin and start moving. Tiny channels collect perspiration and route it to different compartments where it interacts with chemicals that change color to reflect sweat loss, the perspiration’s acidity level, and concentrations of chloride, glucose and lactate.\n\nTogether, those measurements can indicate such things as hydration levels or electrolyte loss. Hold a smartphone over the patch, and an app takes a picture of the colors and interprets what they mean.\n\nIn two studies reported Wednesday, Rogers’ team stuck patches to the arms and backs of 21 healthy volunteers. Nine rode exercise bikes in a gym to compare the sweat patches’ performance with the decidedly lower-tech method of sweat-testing used today — taping on absorbent pads and carting the resulting wet samples to a laboratory. For a more real-world test, the other 12 bicyclists wore the patches while competing in a long-distance outdoor race in Tucson.\n\nThe patches stayed in place and worked even in the challenging outdoor race, and the patches’ biochemical test results agreed with the indoor bikers’ conventional sweat tests, the researchers reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n“It seems really practical,” said Stanford University chemical engineering professor Zhenan Bao, who also researches novel biomedical materials but wasn’t involved with the sweat patch. By simply looking at a color change, “such a patch allows people to now have an opportunity to understand their health and how it changes depending on activities.”\n\nIt’s a growing field: Other research groups around the country, including some of Bao’s colleagues, are pursuing wearable biosensors.\n\nRogers’ sweat patches are designed for one-time use over a few hours. While Wednesday’s studies used an early version that analyzed sweat just once during the exercise, he’s now testing a design capable of multiple measurements over time.\n\n— Lauran Neergaard']","The story rightly cautions that the technology is “experimental” and notes that additional research is needed. But if that’s the case, it’s not clear why this is newsworthy","This story covers a study on the accuracy and durability of a microfluidic skin patch that collects sweat and analyzes it with the help of a smartphone. Researchers found the device detected lactate, glucose, and chloride ion concentrations as well as sweat pH while sticking to the skin of 21 athletes during a controlled cycling test.
The story rightly cautions that the technology is “experimental” and notes that additional research is needed before it can be used for health monitoring. But if that’s the case, it’s not clear why this is newsworthy. There are no interviews with medical experts that might help readers understand whether this technology has viable clinical applications. Also, the story doesn’t discuss costs, potential harms, or the researchers’ commercial ties.

They recommended any pregnancy after weight-loss surgery be considered high-risk and receive stricter monitoring.\n\n""The number of women who are obese in early pregnancy has increased dramatically over the last decades,"" said study author Kari Johansson, a postdoctoral researcher and nutritionist at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. ""Consequently, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of women becoming pregnant after bariatric surgery,"" she added.\n\n""The positive effects of bariatric surgery on health outcomes -- such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease -- are reasonably well-studied, but less is known about the effects on pregnancy and [post-delivery] outcomes,"" Johansson pointed out.\n\nThe study was published online Feb. 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nU.S. health officials say more than one-third of American adults are obese, with a body mass index (BMI, a height-weight calculation) of 30 or higher.\n\nNearly 179,000 obese people underwent weight-loss surgery in the United States in 2013, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. While various techniques may be used, the surgery restricts the amount of food the stomach can hold and/or reduces the intestines\' absorption of calories and nutrients from food.\n\nJohansson and her colleagues used data from nationwide Swedish health registries to compare pregnancies between nearly 600 women who had given birth after bariatric surgery and more than 2,300 women who hadn\'t had the surgery but had the same BMI.\n\nOnly 2 percent of women who had weight-loss surgery developed gestational diabetes, compared to 7 percent of the other group, the researchers said. The surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger-than-normal babies.\n\nHowever, the weight-loss surgery group was twice as likely to give birth to babies considered small for their gestational age, and their pregnancies were also of slightly shorter duration. Additionally, the surgical group experienced a slight bump in the rate of stillbirths, the study found.\n\nThe investigators didn\'t examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients, or higher stillbirths. But Johannson said those outcomes might be due to reduced nutrient absorption resulting from the surgery, with a fetus not receiving sufficient nutrition.\n\n""It has been reported that gastric bypass [a form of bariatric surgery] increases the risk of protein, iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium deficiencies,"" she said. ""Also, many women in our study may have been continuing to lose weight when they became pregnant. Continued weight loss may affect fetal nutrition and could influence growth.""\n\nBecause obesity is linked to poor outcomes for expectant mothers and babies -- including birth defects, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, premature birth and even childhood obesity -- efforts to lose weight before pregnancy are important, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University\'s School of Medicine.\n\nBut Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits.\n\n""I don\'t think pregnancy should be the thing that tips the scale,"" said Caughey. ""I don\'t think the evidence from this study is enough to say now that you should absolutely get this surgery so you have a better pregnancy outcome.""\n\nCaughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight-loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high-risk.\n\nHe also noted that some experts advise women who undergo weight-loss surgery before pregnancy to delay conceiving until 12 to 24 months after the procedure, the period when the most rapid weight loss occurs.\n\n""I think a conversation with someone who takes care of complicated pregnancies, a maternal-fetal medicine doctor, is a good idea,"" Caughey said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery offers more about weight-loss surgery.']","A study finds lower rates of gestational diabetes, but also more small babies, stillbirths, and newborn deaths in women who had bariatric surgery prior to their pregnancies compared with obese women who didn’t have surgery.","This story describes the results of a study that suggests that bariatric surgery is associated with both positive and negative outcomes in pregnancy. The coverage overall was adequate, but missed several opportunities to make the results more useful and meaningful. Strong points include interview comments from an independent expert who helps put the findings in perspective. The major weakness was the story’s failure to quantify harms or call appropriate attention to the potentially higher fetal/newborn death rate in the women who had surgery.

Calcium shows up as white flecks in CT scans. The hard plaques are not the dangerous ones — it is the softer ones that rupture and cause a heart attack. But the amount of calcium in arteries can give a good idea of the presence or extent of coronary artery disease.\n\nDr. Krumholz and Dr. Khurram Nasir, a preventive cardiologist at Baptist Health South Florida, who conceived the new study, reasoned that research on heart scans had not been designed to help doctors make treatment decisions they face today.\n\nCurrent guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. Many people, though, are reluctant to take them. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated?\n\nThe study subjects were nearly 4,000 men and women ages 45 to 84 and included blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians who were recruited in 2000 through 2002. According to today’s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. All had heart scans, and half had no calcium visible on the scans. The subjects were followed for 10 years.\n\nIt turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.\n\nFor example, a person who, according to the current risk calculator, has a 12 percent risk of a heart attack in the next decade should take a statin, the guidelines say. But if that person has a calcium score of zero, the actual risk turned out to be 4 percent, below the 7.5 percent threshold for recommending a statin according to the guidelines and below the 5 percent risk for considering a statin.']",Could heart scans help identify people who don’t need to take statins? This well-written story checks most of our boxes and provides an optimal blend of optimism and skepticism regarding this approach.,"Credit NHLBI.
This story hits almost all the high points we look for in a news report. It gives readers not only the basic summary of an analysis of how CT scan results showing levels of calcium deposits in coronary arteries are associated with 10-year rates of heart attacks and other cardiovascular disease, but it includes more than one skeptical voice and plainly discusses study limitations and potential harms. Still, our criteria are demanding, and the story falls a bit short on two points: disclosures of researcher relationships with industry and then alternatives available to people who might consider getting one of these scans. But the strengths of this story are an example of how to get it right.

The devices are lifesaving when used to open arteries in patients in the throes of a heart attack.\n\nBut they are most often used in patients who have a blocked artery and chest pain that occurs, for example, walking up a hill or going up stairs. Sometimes patients get stents when they have no pain at all, just blockages.\n\nHeart disease is still the leading killer of Americans — 790,000 people have heart attacks each year — and stenting is a mainstay treatment in virtually every hospital. More than 500,000 heart patients worldwide have stents inserted each year to relieve chest pain, according to the researchers. Other estimates are far higher.']","That said, the story contains lots of helpful detail on the limitations of the study.","This New York Times story describes startling news that a very common procedure–inserting a stent to open a blocked blood vessel–does not add benefit over medication in patients with angina. Angina is chest pain due to blocked heart arteries, and is common among people with heart disease.
Sourcing is a strong point for this story: It features perspective from many American cardiologists who were shocked to learn of the negative results from this study. However, two important potential conflicts of interest among the sources were not disclosed.
In addition, the story contains lots of helpful detail on the limitations of the study, the possibility that placebo effects are at play, and how medical practice may or may not change as a result. It also discussed the costs and potential harms of stenting procedures. That said, the story could have provided more information on what the study itself measured–and what, precisely, the results were. The Wall Street Journal story, which we also reviewed, was stronger on this point.

(Nasdaq: EXAS) and Mayo Clinic released today by the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) shows promise for the development of a blood-based lung cancer test. Researchers conducted a multi-round study of nearly 400 patients, which demonstrated high accuracy for detecting lung cancer at all stages.\n\n""These results reveal an opportunity to detect lung cancer from a simple blood draw,"" said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. ""Our collaboration with Mayo Clinic is efficiently identifying biomarkers for additional cancer applications on the same technology platform as Cologuard.""\n\nAACR released an abstract of the study today, ahead of the presentation of the results on April 2, 2017, during the AACR 2017 annual meeting. The findings from the study of 398 patients (311 controls and 87 cancers) demonstrate that biomarkers in plasma achieved high accuracy for all types and stages of lung cancer. Using two independent regression modeling approaches, a panel of four novel methylated DNA markers demonstrated a sensitivity of 91-96 percent at a specificity of 90-94 percent.\n\n""More studies are needed to corroborate accuracy, however, this plasma DNA test approach appears to be a promising new method and may serve as a rational follow-up to the common findings of lung nodules on CT scanning and may have application in screening for lung cancer,"" said David E. Midthun, M.D. a pulmonologist at Mayo Clinic.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, resulting in 1.7 million deaths globally and more than 150,000 deaths in the United States every year. Most symptoms present in the late stages of the disease, when the survival rate is only four percent. Early detection of lung cancer offers the opportunity to reduce mortality. Lung cancer screening is approved for smokers using chest CT scanning. This approach has a sensitivity for lung cancer above 90 percent, but its specificity may fall below 75 percent (a false positive rate of more than 25 percent) because indeterminate lung nodules are so common. Evaluation of these false-positives leads to unnecessary, costly and potentially harmful procedures.\n\n""A blood-based test may help guide next steps after a scan reveals an indeterminate nodule,"" Mr. Conroy said. ""For example, a positive blood test might suggest the need for a biopsy or surgery. In contrast, a negative test might suggest a less aggressive approach. Such a test could offer the opportunity to significantly improve health outcomes and reduce the financial impact on the health care system.""\n\nThe abstract is available here.\n\nA poster presentation of the findings will take place Sunday, April 2, 2017, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. EDT at the Walter E.

People with this type of skin cancer often have mole-looking growths on their skin that tend to be irregular in shape and color, and can be hard to tell apart from benign ones, making the disease difficult to diagnose.\n\nNow, researchers at The Rockefeller University have developed an automated technology that combines imaging with digital analysis and machine learning to help physicians detect melanoma at its early stages.\n\n“There is a real need for standardization across the field of dermatology in how melanomas are evaluated,” says James Krueger, D. Martin Carter Professor in Clinical Investigation and head of the Laboratory of Investigative Dermatology. “Detection through screening saves lives but is very challenging visually, and even when a suspicious lesion is extracted and biopsied, it is confirmed to be melanoma in only about 10 percent of cases.”\n\nIn the new approach, images of lesions are processed by a series of computer programs that extract information about the number of colors present in a growth, and other quantitative data. The analysis generates an overall risk score, called a Q-score, which indicates the likelihood that the growth is cancerous.\n\nPublished in Experimental Dermatology, a recent study evaluating the tool’s usefulness indicates that the Q-score yields 98 percent sensitivity, meaning it is very likely to correctly identify early melanomas on the skin. The ability of the test to correctly diagnose normal moles was 36 percent, approaching the levels achieved by expert dermatologists performing visual examinations of suspect moles under the microscope.\n\n“The success of the Q-score in predicting melanoma is a marked improvement over competing technologies,” says Daniel Gareau, first author of the report and instructor in clinical investigation in the Krueger laboratory.\n\nThe researchers developed this tool by feeding 60 photos of cancerous melanomas and an equivalent batch of pictures of benign growths into image processing programs. They developed imaging biomarkers to precisely quantify visual features of the growths. Using computational methods, they generated a set of quantitative metrics that differed between the two groups of images—essentially identifying what visual aspects of the lesion mattered most in terms of malignancy—and gave each biomarker a malignancy rating.\n\nBy combining the data from each biomarker, they calculated the overall Q-score for each image, a value between zero and one in which a higher number indicates a higher probability of a lesion being a cancerous.\n\nAs previous studies have shown, the number of colors in a lesion turned out to be the most significant biomarker for determining malignancy. And some biomarkers were significant only if looked at in specific color channels—a finding the researchers say could potentially be exploited to identify additional biomarkers and further improve accuracy.\n\n“I think this technology could help detect the disease earlier, which could save lives, and avoid unnecessary biopsies too,” says Gareau. “Our next steps are to evaluate this method in larger studies, and take a closer look at how we can use specific color wavelengths to reveal aspects of the lesions that may be invisible to the human eye, but could still be useful in diagnosis.”\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health and in part by the Paul and Irma Milstein Family Foundation and the American Skin Association.']","This new approach thus far has shown promise, but further research will be needed to validate it as an enhanced diagnostic tool–and that should be made upfront and clear to the journalists and consumers who read the news release.","This news release reports on a study of a computerized technology that combines imaging with digital analysis to help improve the screening of melanoma skin lesions.
The news release explains the specificity and sensitivity of the test. It also clearly discloses who funded the research. One downside is that it’s not until the final paragraph that we learn this is still experimental research that must be confirmed in larger studies. Earlier statements make it sound farther along, e.g., “researchers at The Rockefeller University have developed an automated technology that combines imaging with digital analysis and machine learning to help physicians detect melanoma at its early stages.”
A larger concern is how the release downplayed the high-false positive rate of 64%, saying this “approaches” the false-positive rate of manual detection by expert dermatologist, which studies put at about 32%.

""In general, for postmenopausal women, we are offering them aromatase inhibitors based on the single studies that have been referenced [in these guidelines] and what has already been reported in national meetings.""\n\nThose studies and presentations, added Denlinger, ""have uniformly demonstrated the superiority of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen or a switching strategy or an extended strategy.""\n\nThe new guidelines replace previous guidelines issued in 2002, and subsequent updates in 2003 and 2004.\n\nTamoxifen has been a mainstay of treatment for decades, while aromatase inhibitors are a more recent entry into the field. Both drugs are used as ""adjuvant"" therapy, meaning they are used after surgery and chemotherapy and/or radiation to prevent the cancer from coming back.\n\nThe committee reviewed recent studies which had investigated aromatase inhibitors and/or tamoxifen in women with this particular subtype of breast cancer.\n\nUsing an aromatase inhibitor alone or with tamoxifen therapy improved disease-free survival compared with using tamoxifen alone. It also reduced the risk of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body.\n\nWomen who are pre- or peri-menopausal when they are diagnosed should be given tamoxifen for five years. Aromatase inhibitors are not effective in this age group, the experts note.\n\nAll three aromatase inhibitors on the market - Arimidex (anastrozole), Femara (letrozole) and Aromasin (exemestane) - were essentially equal in their benefit.\n\nThe drugs can also cause side effects that need to be taken into account when prescribing.\n\n""We\'ve learned a huge amount about the various side effect profiles of these products,"" said Dr. Harold J. Burstein, co-chair of the ASCO committee which prepared the guidelines and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ""Aromatase inhibitors are clearly associated with osteoporosis and with bone and joint [conditions]. They might also be associated with a greater risk of hypertension and high cholesterol.""\n\nFor its part, tamoxifen is also associated with serious side effects, which can include cataracts and uterine cancer as well as life-threatening blood clots and stroke.\n\nAnd cost will also be a factor in decision-making.\n\n""Aromatase inhibitors are very expensive. And sometimes we have to make decisions about using drugs that are probably a little less effective but at the same time we have to take into account the financial standpoint,"" said Dr. Jay Brooks, chairman of hematology/oncology at Ochsner Health System in Baton Rouge. ""Are [aromatase inhibitors] better than tamoxifen? Yes, in two areas: preventing recurrent disease in other parts of the body and in preventing a second, separate breast cancer. But the [financial] costs are much more expensive.""\n\nAccording to the new guidelines, 20 milligrams of tamoxifen costs $21.90 a month, while Arimidex can cost $379.80.\n\nOn the other hand, Burstein pointed out, the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole recently became available as a generic, which should lower the cost significantly.\n\nMore information\n\nRead the full guideline at the American Society of Clinical Oncology.']",The story missed an important emphasis on the shared decision-making that should take place regarding use of these drugs. And there were no numbers given on the size of the potential benefits or harms – leaving readers with an incomplete package. ,"This statement from the guideline suggests something different: ""The Update Committee supports careful consideration of adverse effect profiles and patient preferences in deciding whether and when to incorporate AI therapy.""
Rather than framing this as a universal recommendation, the story could have emphasized the nuances that shared decision-making on these issues must take into account.  Some discussion of decision-making came late in the piece, but too little, too late.

In July 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandated that Chantix carry a ""black box"" warning about the potential risks of depression and suicidal thoughts. Recently, the drug was linked to a small but significant risk of heart attack and stroke among people with pre-existing heart disease. Chantix costs roughly $3 per pill.\n\nThe results of the new study were released online in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research prior to publication in the May print issue.\n\nThe study included 15 healthy participants who took part in six sessions. They received a 2-mg dose of Chantix and an inactive placebo, followed three hours later by a beverage containing either a placebo, a low dose of alcohol, or a high dose of alcohol.\n\nBefore and after the sessions, the researchers asked the participants about their mood, tested visual ability and measured physiological responses such as blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nThe participants found the Chantix-booze combination increased the unpleasant effects of alcohol and reduced the rewarding aspects of drinking.\n\nWhether the drug might someday be approved to help problem drinkers cut back remains to be seen, said the researchers, who acknowledged that the study\'s small size is a limitation.\n\n""We are not currently performing any studies with Chantix, although other groups are actively pursuing this line of research with a view to developing Chantix as an aid to people wanting to quit or cut down their drinking,"" Childs said.\n\nDr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and director of the alcohol and drug abuse treatment program at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, termed the study encouraging.\n\nNoting that new ways of treating alcoholism are much needed, Salloum said that Chantix may have a niche among smokers with alcohol-dependence issues. ""We need a lot more options in terms of medicines to help curb drinking,"" he said. ""We have many options for depression and need more for alcoholism, considering it is one of the most common diseases around the world.""\n\nMore research is needed, he noted, but ""this medication may be helpful for people with a drinking problem who are also smokers.""\n\nThe study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about alcoholism and how it is treated at the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.']","A muddy mix of test results, hints from unrelated research and shifting endpoints is likely to leave readers of this story confused about what evidence exists that a stop-smoking drug could help people who drink too much alcohol.","Starting with the headline, any suggestion that this drug has been shown to “curb problem drinking” is not supported by this study. This story does not make clear to readers what information comes from the research that is the main subject and what comes from unrelated research or anecdotes. It doesn’t put the research into the effects of Chantix on people who drink into context with existing drug treatments given to some people with alcohol problems. The story does provide cost and side effect information.
Overall, this is making news out of a small study of the short-term (only hours) effects of a drug on the way alcohol affects human physiology.  One could question the newsworthiness of this story about such a small, short-term study.

Nothing worked.\n\nBut then, like many other foreigners, he journeyed to Peru’s remote Amazonian jungle to drink ayahuasca, a centuries-old, sacred indigenous brew that some Western scientists think can help to heal psychological traumas.\n\nDuring a recent ayahuasca ritual, the 30-year-old from Oklahoma lay on a mattress with about 20 other travelers on the floor of a round, wooden hut in a remote resort near a tributary of the Amazon River. About 45 minutes after drinking the dark concoction, he began to see vibrant colors. He then vomited into a plastic bucket, a common reaction to ayahuasca.\n\nMr. Barrett acknowledged that it didn’t appear therapeutic. But he also described seeing visions of war-torn Afghanistan emerging as a shaman chanted spiritual songs called icaros. He recalled seeing bullet holes in a wall, a dead Afghan woman and the moment when an improvised explosive device almost killed him. He saw his small military base in Afghanistan’s mountainous border region with Pakistan. He heard a loud voice.\n\nAnd then came a burst of light.\n\n“It was as if I was just letting it all go,” Mr. Barrett said later. “I just felt so at ease for the first time in a long time.”\n\nIn the Amazon, scientists have long studied plants with a range of medicinal properties. Some work as anesthetics; others can treat infections; some are known to stop bleeding. Now scientists are starting to look at ayahuasca, a potent hallucinogen known locally as “the vine of the soul” that outsiders are increasingly flocking to sample.\n\nScientists say that ayahuasca—which is legal in Peru and neighboring countries—activates parts of the brain that make it possible to recall deep-rooted memories, increasing self-awareness and offering a chance to reassess past ordeals. Proponents say that it can provide users with spiritual and personal guidance. Others report that it has allowed them to overcome traumas that conventional therapy and antidepressants haven’t cured.\n\nU.S. military veteran Asa Barrett at an ayahuasca center in the Peruvian jungle in January. Some Western scientists think the centuries-old, sacred indigenous brew can help heal psychological traumas. Photo: Ryan Dube/The Wall Street Journal\n\nBut some scientists—and users—warn that ayahuasca can be dangerous. It can be fatal when mixed with other drugs, such as antidepressants, and should be avoided by those who are bipolar or schizophrenic, since it has been known to trigger psychotic episodes. In 2012, a young man from California died after taking ayahuasca in Peru. And last year a Canadian tourist killed a Briton during a nighttime ritual that local authorities are still investigating.\n\nThe brew is made by boiling together a jungle vine called Banisteriopsis caapi with the leaves of a shrub that contains dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a psychedelic that is illegal in the U.S. DMT can cause seizures and, in high doses, comas and respiratory arrests, said Mike Colston, a U.S. Navy captain who heads a Department of Defense agency in charge of studying psychological health and brain injury. The hallucinations caused by ayahuasca can be so traumatic that they can worsen medical conditions such as PTSD, Dr. Colston cautioned.\n\nIn Peru, the influx of foreigners eager to try the brew has spurred the creation of unregulated new lodges to try ayahuasca, some of which, locals say, are opportunistic and employ fake shamans with little training. The brew itself is unregulated by the Peruvian government.\n\nAyahuasca’s proponents say that it has powerful properties. Jeffrey Hill, a 38-year-old construction superintendent from Chicago, said that ayahuasca eased his depression. Juliet Wilkerson, 41, who lives in Texas, said that it helped to cure her debilitating migraines, which she thinks were tied to childhood abuse. Jaylene Johnston, a 53-year-old from Oklahoma, said she had visions of her deceased first husband that allowed her to overcome the trauma of his death and fully commit to her current spouse. “It transformed the relationships that I have right now,” she said.\n\nThe California-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies aims to support an ayahuasca study in Peru this year for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. Later, the group hopes to get approval from the FDA for a study in the U.S. Photo: iStock\n\nThe stories might seem surreal. But they have prompted growing interest by Western researchers, amid a wider revival of studies into the therapeutic use of psychedelics.\n\nThe California-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which has funded researchers at Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania, plans to support an ayahuasca study in Peru this year for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. Later, the group hopes to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration for an ayahuasca study in the U.S.\n\nJessica Nielson, a University of California, San Francisco, neuroscientist who is leading the study, became interested in the potion after trying it herself following a difficult divorce and doubts about her career trajectory. In Peru, she saw how it helped three military veterans.\n\n“Just witnessing their transformation inspired me,” she said. But she cautioned that ayahuasca research is in its infancy. “We really need to get more data on this to understand the safety, what are the limits and who is it appropriate for,” she said.\n\nOther scientists are hoping to understand the brew’s properties. Charles Grob, a psychiatrist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center who studied ayahuasca’s use in a Brazilian church, says that it might help to treat addiction. Jordi Riba, a pharmacologist at the Sant Pau Institute of Biomedical Research in Barcelona, says that ayahuasca may help ease depression.\n\nBecause the experience can be frightening, both men emphasized the importance of consuming the brew in a safe setting A.J. Bullock, a 30-year-old Army sergeant who served in Afghanistan, described nightmarish hallucinations of being chained down and confronted by demons after trying ayahuasca in Peru. It made him feel paranoid, he said, and he considered going home early. By his last ritual, he described a helpful, “radical shift in self-image.” Still, he hesitates to recommend the experience.\n\n“I just don’t know if a lot of people would be able to walk away from it not having gone crazy or at least hurting them more than it helped them,” he said.\n\nDespite the risks, foreigners are converging on Iquitos, a city of 500,000 in Peru’s northeastern Amazon, paying up to $2,500 a week to drink the elixir. Carmen Rojas, the head of the local tourism office, says that she knows of 22 certified jungle lodges that offer ayahuasca. But local tour operators speak of dozens more, including almost 100 ayahuasca centers along one 60-mile stretch of highway. They estimate that as many as 80,000 people a year come to Iquitos for ayahuasca.\n\nOne operator, Pulse Tours, says that its clients are mainly Americans and Canadians but also include people from as far away as Australia, China, Russia and Kazakhstan.\n\nSome longtime ayahuasca proponents in Iquitos lament the recent influx of tourism dollars, which they feel has corrupted the ritual and put some foreigners at risk from fly-by-night operators in the burgeoning industry.\n\n“People have got way too careless about all of this,” said Howard Lawler, 68, a Kentucky native who runs Spirit Quest Shamanic Sanctuary, one of the longest-running ayahuasca centers here. “It is never to be taken for any recreational purpose. It is a very serious medicine.”\n\nWrite to Ryan Dube at ryan.dube@dowjones.com']",At least one personal account of the harms would have brought the story into better balance.,"An ayahuasca ceremony in Peru.

This story describes a growing industry of foreigners traveling to Peru’s Amazonian jungle to drink ayahuasca, a psychedelic brew of local plants that proponents claim can open up the mind and relieve such ailments as depression and addiction. The story includes anecdotes from people who have tried the substance and say it helped them as well as comments from clinical professionals and other users who do provide some caution about adverse effects.
But, the story could have done a better job by attempting to verify users’ claims that the substance helped their mental disorders, and by tapping more independent sources to back up the assertion that there’s “growing interest” in ayahuasca in the scientific community. We also think the six positive patient anecdotes overwhelm the details on the (very real and significant) potential harms. At least one personal account of the harms would have brought the story into better balance.

Millions of Americans don\'t get enough sleep. In a recent survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 35 percent of Americans are sleeping fewer than seven hours per night, the recommended healthy amount.\n\nGood sleep doesn\'t just boost our feelings of well-being. There\'s a growing scientific consensus that it protects us against heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. In sleep labs, participants who have their sleep cycles severely thrown off for just three weeks can start to appear pre-diabetic on blood tests. (If you doubt the importance of sleep consider this: Scientists now believe that cycles of restfulness and alertness are core organizing principles of all life on Earth. Even the tiniest single-cell organisms contain the genetic coding for a circadian rhythm.)\n\nEver wonder how your mind works? Watch The Mind, Explained, our 5-part miniseries on the workings of the brain. Available to stream now on Netflix.\n\nOf course, there are many prescription sleep aids on the market; unfortunately, they aren\'t very effective and can be addictive and dangerous.\n\nSo many prefer to walk into a corner drug store and buy an alternative for just $6 that\'s marketed as safe and all natural. It\'s melatonin, and unlike other chemicals sold as nutrition supplements in America, there\'s some scientific evidence to back up its claims.\n\nBut like all sleep drugs, melatonin\'s story is complicated. Despite the fact it\'s a chemical that our bodies naturally produce during sleep, how melatonin actually works, and what it\'s best for, is worth a good, hard look.\n\nWhat is melatonin?\n\nMelatonin was originally discovered in the 1950s, when a dermatology lab thought it played a role in skin pigmentation. The researchers all took a massive dose of their newfound chemical, expecting their skin to lighten. But they just got sleepy.\n\nWhat scientists eventually realized about melatonin is this: It\'s the hormone that tells the body when it is nighttime. It\'s made in the pineal gland, a pinecone-shaped structure located deep in the brain.\n\n""In lower vertebrates like the frog, the pineal is in fact a third eye — it’s a light-dark receptor,"" Dick Wurtman, a MIT cognitive scientist who help discover melatonin\'s function in humans, says. Scientists once assumed that it had served a function in mammals but had become a vestigial organ, bound to ""disappear in a few million years,"" Wurtman says.\n\nIn the 1960s, Wurtman and his team at MIT found that light does still reach the pineal in mammals — through the eyes — and controls the release of melatonin. During the day, melatonin is inhibited by light. At night, it flows into the bloodstream — unless we\'re around bright light or blue light, which suppress the release of melatonin, and keep us up.\n\nWhen it does reach the bloodstream, melatonin acts as a messenger. How the body responds to the message depends on the animal. Rats, for instance, are nocturnal, so melatonin may play a role in keeping them awake. In humans and other day-dwelling creatures, it prepares the body for rest and helps maintain that rest throughout the night.\n\nIn humans, melatonin is thought to promote sleep in two ways.\n\n1. The exact pathway isn\'t well understood, but it\'s believed melatonin broadly suppresses the areas of the brain involved in wakefulness. Melatonin may also play a role in lowering body temperature, which is needed for sleep.\n\n2. Melatonin helps set the overall pace of the master circadian clock in the body. Scientists have shown that when people are given melatonin in the afternoon, their body clocks can be tricked into thinking it\'s later, and they get sleepier sooner. This can be handy if you\'re suffering from jet lag, and your body thinks it\'s still in an earlier time zone. (More on this later.)\n\nSo how well does melatonin work?\n\nWhen assessing melatonin, there are a couple of big questions researchers are asking:\n\nDoes it help people with insomnia fall asleep faster?\n\nDoes it help people stay asleep?\n\nDoes it help people sleep in new time zones?\n\nIs it helpful for people adjusting to new shifts at work?\n\nAnd does it reliably shift a person\'s body clock to a new phase?\n\nThe studies that have been done on these questions have tested a wide range of doses on many different populations, which makes direct comparisons among studies very difficult, and limits what we can really learn from them. But the meta analyses of melatonin that do exist does find some evidence that it can be helpful in regard to most of the above questions.\n\nPatty Deuster, a research scientist at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, was the senior author on a 2014 systematic review on melatonin. She and her team amassed a total of 35 randomized, placebo-controlled studies on healthy people with or without a diagnosis of insomnia. The effect of melatonin for insomnia was positive, but ""weak,"" says Deutster. More studies with greater number of participants are needed.\n\nHer review found weak positive findings for sleep onset, staying asleep, and jet lag. The evidence for shift workers and shifting the body clock were inconclusive. (However, the experts with whom I spoke said melatonin should be taken in the late afternoon to have the best chance at shifting the biological clock. Deuster\'s report only looked at phase-shifting studies when melatonin is given at night.)\n\nInternational health organizations have analyzed melatonin research as well.\n\nIn Europe, melatonin is only available by prescription in some countries. In 2011, the European Food Safety Authority, which regulates melatonin, conducted an overview of the evidence on melatonin and concluded this: ""Melatonin helps reduce the time to fall asleep.\'""\n\nThat might be true, but not all researchers agree that melatonin can make a meaningful difference. Philip Gehrman, a sleep researcher and clinician at the University of Pennsylvania, says, ""The research is pretty clear that melatonin is a lousy sleeping pill.""\n\nA 2005 meta review looked at this question more closely, analyzing 15 placebo-controlled studies of otherwise healthy people with insomnia. It found, on average, melatonin decreased the time it took to fall asleep compared to placebo by 3.9 minutes, it increased the time spent asleep by 13.7 minutes, and increased sleep efficiency (a ratio of time spent lying bed versus time sleeping) by 3.1 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2007 meta-analysis found that a type of prescription sleeping pill called benzodiazepines got people to sleep 10 minutes faster on average. Non-benzodiazepines (like Ambien) get people to sleep about 12.8 minutes faster. And once you\'re asleep, these drugs only increase the time spent asleep by 30 or so minutes. (Don\'t forget that these drugs can be addicting, and can kill a person in high enough doses.)\n\nMelatonin may work best for jet lag and in people who have low melatonin\n\nWhen a person is jet lagged, their body\'s clock is off from the clock of their destination. This can make it hard to sleep.\n\nMelatonin may be particularly helpful for jet laggers because it can both help change a person\'s internal clock to match local time, and it can help them sleep after a long, restless flight.\n\nIn 2002, the Cochrane Library conducted a systematic review of melatonin\'s ability to help a person readjust to a new sleep schedule after jet lag at doses as small as .5 milligrams. ""Melatonin is remarkably effective in preventing or reducing jet lag, and occasional short-term use appears to be safe,"" the review concluded, especially when used after eastward flights. ""Eight of the ten trials found that melatonin, taken close to the target bedtime at the destination (10pm to midnight), decreased jet-lag from flights crossing five or more time zones.""\n\nMelatonin also seems to work much better for certain individuals.\n\n""If your sleep problem results from a deficiency of the hormone melatonin, then melatonin will be very effective for your sleep problem,"" Wurtman says. If sleep problems stem from anxiety, for instance, it will be less effective.\n\nFrank Scheer, who studies chronobiology at Harvard, agrees: An oral dose of melatonin has the best chance to make someone sleepy when internal melatonin levels are low. ""In healthy subjects, if you give subjects melatonin in the middle of the day, it will help them sleep [during the middle of the day],"" he says. ""If I give melatonin to you during the night [when melatonin levels are higher], and you\'re healthy, melatonin won\'t have any effect on sleep.""\n\nScheer also notes that melatonin doesn\'t follow a typical dose-response curve. That means taking a higher dose of melatonin doesn\'t necessarily result in more sleepiness.\n\nPeople tend to produce less melatonin as they age, so the hormone may be more suited to treating the insomnia that\'s the result of aging. Melatonin also been shown to be much more effective for people with delayed sleep phase, a condition where a person\'s biological clock is permanently out of sync with the rest of the world.\n\nAre there side effects?\n\nDeuster\'s review looked at the reporting of adverse effects across all 35 studies, and found nothing serious. The most commonly reported side effect was drowsiness (which is kind of the point of taking melatonin) and headache.\n\nBut Scheer says there are some cases where melatonin can have adverse effects. For some people with a particular genetic variant, melatonin impairs the body\'s ability to process blood glucose. ""It\'s not harmless,"" he says.\n\nThe risks of long-term use have also not been assessed. ""There are no clear studies beyond six months of duration on melatonin\'s use,"" Scheer says.\n\nWhen to take melatonin\n\nResearchers have never done a systematic review of whether the timing of melatonin matters for people who want to get to sleep faster.\n\nThe ones I talked to also disagreed on when to take it — depending on whether they thought melatonin was better for sleep promotion or circadian clock resetting.\n\nAccording to Gehrman, melatonin\'s ability to shift the circadian clock is stronger than its ability to promote immediate sleep. Therefore, ""instead of taking it at bed time, you take it several hours before bedtime,"" he says. This can ""advance"" the biological clock around a half hour, every day.\n\nScheer agrees that taking melatonin in the late afternoon or early evening ""will result in the largest phase advance, meaning the next day your body clock will be slightly earlier."" Exposure to sunlight in the morning helps, too, he says, and may be even more effective than melatonin, or should be used in addition to melatonin, when pushing the clock forward.\n\nWurtman, however, doesn\'t recommend taking melatonin several hours before bed. He says melatonin\'s (albeit weak) ability to promote sleep on the spot means that people should take it shortly before bed.\n\nOverall, Scheer says, the ideal time for any individual to take it is hard to predict. Melatonin is ""not simple to use as a consumer,"" he says, adding that many primary care physicians may not know about its subtleties.\n\nAnother reason for caution: Melatonin isn\'t well regulated\n\nVox\'s Julia Belluz has done extensive reporting on the murky regulations of dietary supplements in America. Basically, she finds, the dietary supplement aisle is a minefield. Supplements don\'t always contain what they say they do, and they can have harmful additives. That\'s why it\'s important make sure the brand of melatonin you buy has its contents verified by a third party, like USP. (According to Wurtman, the fact that we treat melatonin as a dietary supplement is ""unmitigated bullshit."" None of our bodies\' natural melatonin comes from diet.)\n\nIn the case of melatonin, the lax regulations means it can be sold in massive, completely, unnecessary doses. At the drug store, it\'s easy to pick up a 10 milligram per pill bottle of melatonin. But this is likely overkill. Many of the studies on melatonin find that it works just as well at small doses — around one milligram or less — as it does in high doses. Plus, there\'s a chance a huge dose will desensitize your brain to the hormone.\n\n""If you present to your brain blood levels of melatonin that are way, way higher than any that occur normally, you desensitize the brain’s receptors to melatonin,"" Wurtman says. ""You become less and less and less responsive.""\n\nThe bottom line, according to the experts? Start with a small dose and see if it works for you.\n\nAnd finally: Know that a pill may never fully combat the reasons why Americans are sleeping poorly. There are myriad ways the modern world conspires against good sleep: Stress at home and work, noisy neighborhoods, spending too little time in bright daylight, drinking too much caffeine, working odd shifts, not getting enough exercise, spending too much time with smartphones late at night, and the list goes on.']","This in-depth, well-research story hit all the right notes.","The story offers a broad overview of the hormone melatonin and its use as a supplement to help people get more, or better, sleep. The story looks at a number of meta-analyses of melatonin-sleep research studies, acknowledges the difficulties in assessing the literature, and provides an evenhanded perspective on the potential benefits and limitations of melatonin use to address sleep problems. It took careful assessments of benefits, harms and alternatives. Well done.

Perhaps,"[""The researchers, who published their findings in The New England Journal of Medicine, noted that the deck might have been stacked in favor of a hazardous outcome because study participants, especially the group that received testosterone, had high rates of high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and elevated blood lipids. Then again, this may be a realistic population to study, given that many candidates for hormone therapy are likely to have such health issues.\n\nAdvisement ‘in Limbo’\n\nA $45 million study financed by the National Institute on Aging is under way at 12 medical centers to see if a year of treatment with testosterone will help 800 men aged 65 and older with low levels of the hormone and problems with physical functioning, fatigue and sexual or cognitive performance. The study, in which the men are being randomly assigned to receive the hormone or a look-alike placebo, will also evaluate the hormone’s effects on cardiac risk factors.\n\nStill, this study will not answer the question of whether it is safe to use the hormone for years, even decades, which would be necessary to maintain any benefits. A major concern is whether long-term use would promote the growth of prostate cancer, which is present but hidden in as many as half of older men.\n\nPhoto\n\n“There are not many good studies of testosterone in older men,” Dr. William J. Bremner, a urologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, said in an interview. “The studies are small and the longest of them lasted only three years. We need the same kind of study for testosterone as the Women’s Health Initiative — several thousand men followed for maybe 10 years. Currently, we’re in limbo as to how to advise patients.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the need for such a study for men is “less compelling” because, in contrast to women, who experience an abrupt drop in estrogen at menopause, often with disruptive symptoms, hormone decline in aging men is far more gradual, and symptoms, when they occur, are commonly viewed as normal signs of aging, not hormone deficiency.\n\nA large European study published in the same issue of the journal sought to better determine who, among middle-aged and elderly men, might be candidates for testosterone replacement. Among a sample of 3,369 men aged 40 to 79, researchers at eight European medical centers found that “limited physical vigor” and three sexual symptoms — diminished sexual thoughts and morning erections and erectile dysfunction — were most closely linked to low levels of testosterone.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The patch can cause skin irritation, and the gel can be transferred to others through skin contact unless care is taken to cover the area where it is applied. But oral administration is rarely used because of toxic effects on the liver.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWeighing Help vs. Harm\n\nThe most common reason men seek testosterone therapy is waning sexual desire or performance, although the ability of the hormone to relieve sexual symptoms is unpredictable. More than one-quarter of men with normal testosterone levels have such symptoms, and many men with subnormal levels do not. Dr. Bremner said he typically suggests a trial of therapy for up to a year to see if sexual function or other symptoms improve.\n\nCiting the results of many small studies, Dr. Bremner said, “There is good evidence that testosterone administration can improve muscle mass and strength and increase bone density” in men with subnormal levels. Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, a urologist at Harvard Medical School and author of “Testosterone for Life” (McGraw-Hill, 2009), said in an interview that other noted benefits include a decrease in body fat and total cholesterol and improved blood sugar metabolism.\n\nIn a report on the risks of testosterone therapy, written with Dr. Ernani Luis Rhoden and published in 2004 in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Morgentaler noted that testosterone has widespread effects throughout the body, but he and Dr. Rhoden concluded that with proper monitoring, any looming hazards can be readily detected.\n\nBefore the most recent study, at doses considered normal, the testosterone gel showed little or no effect on cardiovascular risk, the two doctors reported. Injections could result in harmful thickening of the blood, however, especially if above-normal blood levels of the hormone result.\n\nAlthough testosterone can cause overgrowth of the prostate, studies have not shown harm to urinary function, Dr. Morgentaler said. The risk of prostate cancer is of greater concern, given that suppressing the body’s natural production of testosterone can cause this cancer to regress. Men considering treatment should first undergo a full prostate exam and PSA measurement, with periodic prostate checkups during therapy, Dr. Bremner said.""]","As well as this story scored on our criteria, the failure to address costs and the potential for conflict of interest in a source can’t be overlooked. (Several of the satisfactory scores were close calls.  Read the full review.)","We wish there were more stories like this one which take a broad view of the evidence on a given treatment and aren’t simply reactions to a press release about a new study. This column on testosterone therapy rightly emphasizes the limited and conflicting data to support this treatment and the uncertain potential for harm. The comparison to hormone replacement in women provides a useful reminder of the limitations of observational studies. 
With that being said, there were some gaps in the coverage. The first relates to the cost of treatment, which can be quite high but isn’t mentioned. The second relates to the potential for a conflict of interest with one of the experts quoted in the piece.

A small new study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience suggests that one easy way for older adults to get deeper sleep and stronger memories is to listen to a certain soothing sound called “pink noise”—a mix of high and low frequencies that sounds more balanced and natural than its better-known cousin, “white noise.”\n\nIt may sound strange, but previous studies have found that playing so-called pink noise during sleep improves the memory of younger adults. “We wanted to see if it would work in older people, too,” says senior author Dr. Phyllis Zee, professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Older people tend to get less slow-wave sleep and are at greater risk for memory impairment.\n\nZee and her fellow researchers had 13 adults ages 60 and older spend two nights in a sleep lab. On both nights, the participants took a memory test at night, went to sleep wearing headphones and an electrode cap, and repeated the memory test in the morning.\n\nOn one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. “The noise is fairly pleasant; it kind of resembles a rush of water,” says Zee. “It’s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it’s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.” The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. No noise was played during the other night.\n\n(Here’s what pink noise sounded like to study participants, in the box below.)\n\nAfter analyzing everyone’s sleep waves, the team found that people’s slow-wave oscillations increased on the nights punctuated by pink noise. Come morning, people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night. On the nights without the noise, memory recall did not improve as much.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips.

Music, nature sounds and white (or pink) noise apps may still help improve sleep, she says—which, in itself, is good for the body and for the brain.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]",How can a memory test taken after one night of sleeping with “pink noise” demonstrate long-term memory effects? The story is quiet on that issue.,"Sleep is a popular health news topic, as a large number of Americans suffer from at least occasional insomnia. Adding in that good sleep aids memory in older folks heightens the interest for any reader who’s worried about forgetting where their keys are again. The story describes some details of the study design and contains an audio file so readers can hear what the burst of pink noise sounds like.
Unfortunately, the headline exaggerates the study finding. Improving memory for one day in 13 adults doesn’t translate into improved sleep and memory for all older adults. In addition, the article takes a gee-whiz approach to the research presented. It’s not white noise, it’s pink noise! And it’s not just turning on an app or a pink noise generator, but precisely timing the pink noise to an individual’s slow-wave sleep pattern. As the complexity goes up, skeptical readers should be asking if the benefits are worth all the fuss. In the end, there’s not enough specifics about what the benefits are or what they might mean.

""This refutes that.""\n\nThe findings, published online Jan. 28 in the journal Cancer, are especially strong for women over 50 with hormone-sensitive cancers, the researchers found.\n\nEarlier research had also concluded that the two procedures are similarly effective, but Hwang\'s is a more ""real-world"" study.\n\nHwang\'s team looked at 14 years of data from the California Cancer Registry, following more than 112,000 women with early stage breast cancer (stages 1 or 2) between 1990 and 2004. Ages ranged from 39 to 80.\n\nMore than half (55 percent) had lumpectomy and radiation, while 45 percent had mastectomy (complete breast removal) alone.\n\nHwang compared lumpectomy and radiation with mastectomy alone, not mastectomy plus radiation. ""We wanted to look at early stage disease, and those patients typically don\'t get radiation after mastectomy,"" she said.\n\nThe researchers tracked the women\'s progress for a median of more than nine years (half followed longer, half less). During that time, more than 31,000 women died, nearly 40 percent of them from breast cancer. The others died of other causes.\n\nFor the first three years after treatment, those who had a mastectomy had a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other ailments than those who had lumpectomy. This may indicate that the women who underwent lumpectomy were generally healthier, Hwang said.\n\nOver the entire follow-up, those who underwent lumpectomy were more likely to survive the breast cancer.\n\n""The group that benefited the most -- who had the biggest difference in breast cancer survival -- were those women over 50 with estrogen-receptor positive disease,"" Hwang said. This means their cancer depends on estrogen to grow.\n\nAmong those women, the lumpectomy group had a 13 percent lower risk of death from breast cancer and a 19 percent lower risk of death from any cause than those who had a mastectomy.\n\nNot all women with early stage breast cancers can have a lumpectomy, Hwang said. In this procedure, just the tumor and some healthy tissue are removed, sparing the rest of the breast. Among the exceptions are those whose cancers are too large, or those who have different cancers in the same breast.\n\nThe percent of women with early breast cancers choosing a mastectomy has risen recently, after a dip in previous years. Hwang and others suspect that women told they could safely opt for lumpectomy were still afraid to try it.\n\nThe new research, which was funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, suggests that if a lumpectomy is possible, it may actually increase survival, Hwang said.\n\nThe findings may reverse the mastectomy trend, said Dr. Laura Kruper, co-director of the breast oncology program at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study is scientifically sound in many ways, Kruper said. ""They broke it down by year of diagnosis and by age category,"" she said. ""They looked at socioeconomic status, and they kept it early stage.""\n\nDr. Wendy Woodward, section chief for breast radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said that for women with early cancers, the study ""clearly reiterates there is no detriment to cancer control in having a lumpectomy and radiation for breast-conserving surgery candidates.""\n\nBut, Woodward added, ""I am not sure the study convinces us that lumpectomy and radiation is better for breast cancer survival, but it may be.""\n\nThe study was observational, Hwang stressed. It found a link or association but could not provide cause-and-effect proof that the breast-conserving treatment is more effective than mastectomy in early stage breast cancer.\n\nHwang believes the study does arm women with valuable information. However, ""I don\'t want women who chose mastectomy to think they did the wrong thing,"" Hwang said. ""At the end of the day, personal preference trumps everything else. I fully support the patient\'s options to choose the best treatment for themselves.""\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about lumpectomy, visit the American Cancer Society.']","After all of the research about lumpectomy & radiation versus mastectomy, what made this study new and significant? This story should have done a better job of explaining what made this a “more real-world study.”","Strong point: The Independent expert perspectives added to the story.
Weaker points:  Harms not discussed.  Benefits not adequately quantified.  The true novelty of the study was not adequately explained. And why was there no mention of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy?

Maybe.,"['Study: Aspirin Cuts Deaths From Wide Variety Of Cancers\n\nA daily aspirin to prevent cancer? Maybe.\n\ntoggle caption iStockphoto.com\n\nA British study offers compelling -- though not clinching -- evidence that the humble aspirin tablet can prevent death from a variety of cancers, if you take the medicine long enough in middle age. Even a baby aspirin might be enough.\n\nDon\'t start popping aspirin every morning to fight tumors without talking to your doctor, though.\n\nYes, scientists have already published strong evidence suggesting aspirin can cut bowel cancer and deaths. The painkiller\'s anti-inflammatory properties and effects in damping down precancerous polyps may be involved.\n\nAnd the latest study, published in The Lancet, suggests aspirin could provide protection against a wide variety of tumors. They range from pancreatic cancer to the type of lung cancer that strikes nonsmokers.\n\nFor some of these cancers, the reduction in death was remarkable. Twenty years after people had started taking aspirin regularly (and kept it up for at least five years), their deaths from esophageal cancer were reduced by 60 percent compared to study subjects who got a placebo.\n\nDeaths from adenomatous lung cancer were cut 30 percent, those from colorectal cancer 40 percent, and those from prostate cancer 10 percent.\n\nStill, none of the big guns in cancer and prevention -- the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, or the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force -- are ready to advise healthy people to start taking aspirin to prevent cancer.\n\nBut the latest batch of evidence deserves a closer look. It encompasses eight earlier studies that compared cancer deaths among more than 25,000 people randomly assigned to get aspirin (of different doses) or placebo. And the researchers were able to gather more information about cancer deaths for up to 20 years after those studies ended about nearly 13,000 people.\n\nFor cancer prevention experts, the British study is provocative and significant. ""This is definitely the first time that research has shown that long-term aspirin use can reduce the risk of deaths due to cancer,"" Dr. Asad Umar of the National Cancer Institute\'s division of cancer prevention tells Shots.\n\nIn fact, Umar says, no drug has been shown before now to prevent cancer deaths. ""This is definitely hypothesis-generating for future studies,"" Umar says.\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital\'s Dr. Andrew Chan, who studies the effect of aspirin on gastrointestinal cancers, says the new study will feed a growing sense among experts ""that there is likely some potential anticancer effect of aspirin.""\n\nDr. Peter Rothwell, an Oxford University neurologist who led the study, tells Shots that aspirin\'s effect on cancer is ""quite a lot bigger"" than its benefit in preventing heart attacks and strokes -- the reason millions of Americans already swallow a baby aspirin every day.\n\n""So I think in the fullness of time, preventing cancer will be seen to be the main reason for taking aspirin in healthy individuals,"" Rothwell says.\n\nHe started taking a daily dose of aspirin a couple of years ago as the results of his study emerged. ""It was looking as though there was something going on, and I thought it was a sufficiently large benefit to be worth doing something about,"" says the 46-year-old researcher.\n\nRothwell says the ""sensible time"" to start taking aspirin ""would be before the risk of cancer starts to rise, at about 45."" He says prophylactic aspirin is ""worth thinking about"" for people with a family history of early cancers.\n\nBut aspirin carries risks. The biggest is stomach bleeding, although it also raises the risk of brain hemorrhage. Daily aspirin doubles a person\'s gastrointestinal bleeding risk to about 2 in every 1,000 people a year. But Rothwell says this bleeding hazard is ""drowned out"" by the cancer benefit.\n\nProf. Peter Elwood of the University of Cardiff, who wasn\'t involved in the new study, agrees. ""There\'s a small risk of any of us having a gastric bleed,"" Ellwood said at a Lancet press conference Monday. ""But when you inspect the data…you find that the mortality from the bleed is not increased. In other words, aspirin seems to be increasing the less-serious bleeds,"" he said.\n\nTo be sure, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\'s currently recommends against taking aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer, the type of cancer for which there is the largest body of scientific work. The benefits of daily low-dose aspirin can exceed the risks for many middle-aged and older people when it comes to preventing heart attacks and strokes, the task force says.\n\nSo for those already taking prophylactic aspirin for this reason, the possible anticancer effects are just icing on the cake. Other healthy people interested in taking aspirin to prevent cancer should consult their doctors, experts say, and possibly await further evidence.\n\nA final word about dose: The new study didn\'t find any additional anticancer benefit for aspirin doses above 75 milligrams a day -- the British dose for a ""baby"" aspirin. In the United States, a baby aspirin weighs in at 81 milligrams. However, experts say more information is needed on the optimum dose for cancer prevention.\n\n""There\'s a little controversy about whether a baby aspirin dose is enough,"" says Harvard\'s Chan. ""We think that probably a standard adult aspirin dose of 325 milligrams is more likely to be effective.""']","This story comes close to clinching a balanced presentation of evidence from a meta-analysis of the cancer prevention potential of aspirin. Readers get a sense of what’s new about the study results, while also being cautioned not to take it as the final word.","This story about aspirin’s potential benefits in cancer prevention does a better job than some others we reviewed, yet this story still left a lot of gaps in the picture. The overall tone couched the potential benefits in cautious statements about the potential risks of aspirin and scitific uncertainties that this study leaves unresolved. The story was one of the few to quantify the potential harms involved in taking aspiring daily. It also made good use of outside experts. However, we wish it had provided readers with more of the absolute numbers behind what appear to be stunning relative differences in treatment effects. There were clear examples of the small differences in the absolute number of deaths featured in the study that could have been featured in the coverage here and elsewhere.

The genetic disease causes severe and multiple seizures, which often leave parents guessing if the terror of watching their child seize up will pass or turn fatal.\n\nHer Boise, Idaho, family learned that oil extracted from marijuana had helped other children and wanted to see if it would help Alexis too.\n\n""Parent to parent, when you\'re in a small community and 10 people that you know are all having success, that\'s no longer anecdotal,"" Clare Carey, her mother, said. ""That\'s hope.""\n\nBut Idaho\'s stringent marijuana laws do not allow for medicinal use. The family began lobbying lawmakers to decriminalize the oil almost two years ago. Now, they\'ve got some legislative backers and an upcoming hearing, as Idaho joins a larger movement to loosen laws to allow the use of marijuana extract oil.\n\nTwelve states have legalized the oil while still banning medical marijuana. Virginia legalized the oil Feb. 26. In Utah, lawmakers have given initial approval to let those with chronic and debilitating diseases consume edible marijuana products, while still banning smoking.\n\nMarijuana extract oil first received attention when a Colorado family fought and won for access for their daughter who also had Dravet Syndrome. It is similar to hemp oil, which is legal in Idaho and can be bought in grocery stores.\n\nWith no known cure for Dravet Syndrome, children are often prescribed a cocktail of medications to counter the seizures. However, the heavy drugs often come with side-effects that can permanently damage a child\'s developing liver, kidneys and other organs.\n\nProponents of cannabidiol oil, a non-psychotropic extract of marijuana, argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children.\n\nOver time, Carey hopes that the oil would also reduce the number of medications her daughter relies on.\n\n""Like any parent, you never give up hope that you can get complete seizure control,"" she said. ""Children die from Dravet by any one of the seizures. Alexis could have a seizure that may not stop, we never really know.""\n\nAlexis began having seizures when she was two months old. But even in 2003, her mom says a lack of awareness of the disease led to many doctors not automatically suspecting it could be a rare, genetic disorder.\n\nIt wasn\'t until Alexis lost all speech and potty control when she was 2 that doctors determined she had Dravet Syndrome, Carey said.\n\nSince then, Alexis\' parents have put her on a variety of diets and medications to help reduce the seizures but the disease is tricky to manage. Dravet Syndrome often causes a variety of different kinds of seizures but medications typically target one particular type.\n\nAlexis\' seizures usually occur at night, which means one of her parents regularly sleep with her and monitor her sleep patterns. During the day, Alexis requires constant supervision. While most 10-year-olds freely run and jump around, Alexis walks— albeit sometimes unstably and with help going up and down stairs.\n\nCarey says working with Idaho\'s Republican-controlled Legislature has been easier than anticipated.\n\nLawmakers who resisted the idea at first blush have warmed up to the idea, she said.\n\nThis year, the bill is endorsed by Republicans Sen. Curt McKenzie and Rep. Tom Leortscher. Both are chairs of the legislature\'s State Affairs Committees, panels that often get tossed controversial legislation and have a high bar for clearance.\n\nThe measure unanimously passed the Senate committee during its introduction hearing, which means it now goes on to a full hearing in front of the committee.\n\nYet the bill must survive a Statehouse that approved a resolution in 2013 vowing never to legalize marijuana for any purpose.']",This story is about access to a marijuana-based extract called cannabidiol oil. But we’re not necessarily talking about something that’s synthesized at the local dispensary. This is a pharmaceutical cannabidiol product that can be obtained with FDA permission by physicians through an Investigational New Drug application. The story should have made this clear.,"The story zeroes in on a 10-year-old Idaho girl’s struggles with a rare, life-threatening form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome. The article implies a marijuana-derived extract called cannabidiol oil has helped people with similar ailments who sought alternatives to traditional anti-seizure medications. But it offers no evidence to support those benefits beyond the testimony of a parent with an afflicted child. In addition, the story doesn’t provide the context needed to understand the family’s efforts to legalize marijuana (aka cannabis) products in Idaho. Importantly, there was no mention of the fact that there is a commercial cannabidiol product available through the FDA’s Investigational New Drug program. The fact that this product is available elsewhere with sanctioning by the FDA would probably make a big difference in many readers’ perceptions of the issue.

""The beauty of this study is that we were able to inhibit tumor growth in mice without toxicity.""\n\nDuring the past decade, some cancer research has highlighted the potential therapies found in plants, including chemicals found in foods such as turmeric, apple peels and green tea. These compounds minimize one of the risk factors for cancer, inflammation within the body. People who have chronic inflammation because of chronic infection, autoimmune disease or conditions such as obesity have a higher cancer risk because of damage to normal cells.\n\nThe researchers first tested 142 natural compounds on mouse and human cell lines to see which inhibited prostate cancer cell growth when administered alone or in combination with another nutrient. The most promising active ingredients were then tested on model animals: ursolic acid, a waxy natural chemical found in apple peels and rosemary; curcumin, the bright yellow plant compound in turmeric; and resveratrol, a natural compound common to red grapes or berries.\n\n""These nutrients have potential anti-cancer properties and are readily available,"" says Tiziani. ""We only need to increase concentration beyond levels found in a healthy diet for an effect on prostate cancer cells.""\n\nThe new research paper also demonstrates how the plant-based chemicals work together. Combining ursolic acid with either curcumin or resveratrol prevents cancer cells from gobbling something that they need to grow, glutamine. This is a neat solution: blocking the uptake of a nutrient needed by prostate cancer cells with nutrients that are commonly in the human diet.\n\n###\n\nFunders of this research include that National Institutes of Health and the University of Texas System. The experiment was designed, analyzed and written up with coauthors Alessia Lodi, John DiGiovanni and Achinto Saha, all of UT Austin. Additional authors include Xiyuan Lu, Bo Wang, Enrique Sentandreu, Meghan Collins, all of UT Austin; and Mikhail Kolonin of The Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston.']","The release suggests turmeric, apple peels and red grapes can prevent prostate cancer, but never clarifies that research on animals is distinct from human clinical trials.","This news release attempts to translate preliminary research on plant chemicals into actionable dietary advice. Bad move. Researchers used an innovative screening strategy to cull through 142 natural compounds to identify a combination of three phytochemicals — found in foods such as turmeric, apple peels and red grapes — that inhibited the growth of implanted prostate tumors in mice. Their work is described in the online journal Precision Oncology. But it’s a big leap from the lab table to the dinner table, where the release says that by indulging in certain foods, you can “enjoy the fact that you are eating something that could play a role starving — or even preventing — cancer.” Nowhere does it warn that studies of cell lines or animals don’t prove a human benefit.

If they are at high risk of heart disease, they\'re doing the right thing, according to draft recommendations issued Monday by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nThe independent panel also said that taking low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years may protect against colorectal cancer, at least in people who are already taking it to prevent heart attacks and stroke.\n\nAdults between the ages of 50 and 59 who have a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years benefit the most from taking about 81 milligrams of aspirin every day, the panel says.\n\nBut the potential benefit is smaller for adults between the ages of 60 and 69. And it\'s unknown for adults under 50 or over 70. People should talk with their health care provider to find out if they have health problems that would justify taking aspirin, according to Dr. Douglas Owens, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a member of the task force.\n\nFor example, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, obesity, age and diabetes can all increase heart disease risk. ""Because heart attacks are caused by clots in the arteries of the heart, aspirin can help prevent heart attack and it can also help prevent strokes that are caused by blood clots,"" Owens says.\n\nSeveral groups including the American Heart Association offer online calculators to help people figure out their risk, which, along with discussion with a health care provider, can help determine whether daily aspirin might be useful.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat. Daily aspirin can cause bleeding in the stomach and brain. And Owens says that people with medical conditions like ulcers, kidney problems, liver problems or bleeding disorders are more vulnerable, as are people who take blood-thinning drugs and NSAIDs.\n\nThese new recommendations aren\'t final, and are open to public comment.\n\nConcerns have been raised about whether aspirin is really effective enough, when so many other medicines are available to help control heart disease risk.\n\nOne physician with major concerns is Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. ""I think that millions of Americans are taking aspirin — some of them are really the \'worried well,\' "" he says.\n\nIf people don\'t have a significantly increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade, Nissen says, they may be ""causing more harm than benefit.""\n\nAnd while many medical groups recommend daily aspirin to lower heart disease risk, not all federal agencies agree. The Food and Drug Administration actually issued a warning against routinely taking aspirin to prevent heart disease in people without significantly high risk.\n\nNissen worries that many people are mistaking their actual heart disease risk. ""With all the good therapies, better blood pressure control, better cholesterol control, all the things we do in modern medicine,"" he says, ""over the last couple of decades, we\'ve had nearly a 50 percent reduction in the rate of cardiovascular disease.""\n\nPeople who don\'t really need to should not be taking aspirin every day, says Nissen. ""It\'s just not prudent or safe,"" he says, noting that bleeding in the abdomen or brain is extremely dangerous and can be fatal. Nissen does agree with the general consensus that taking low dose aspirin is beneficial for people who have had a heart attack or stroke.\n\nBut for pretty much everyone else, assessing actual heart disease risk in consultation with your doctor is crucial to deciding whether to take aspirin every day.']","Solid reporting overall. But without some numbers attached to the benefits and harms of aspirin, readers don’t receive the full story.","A federal task force has issued a recommendation to limit the daily ingestion of low-dose aspirin among Americans to individuals with a clear risk of heart attack or stroke.  This story delivers that message effectively but lacks the quantitative specificity that would have helped readers/listeners fully understand the possible benefits or harms of continuing their aspirin-a-day habit.  While a brief radio story may well be unable to be that specific, providing the additional information on the outlet’s text version of the story would be helpful.

Measuring non-HDL and apoB provides a more accurate assessment for cardiovascular risk, as they account for the total \'bad cholesterol\' found in the blood.\n\n""The findings are most important for populations at high risk for cardiovascular disease, such as Type 2 diabetics, who have normal levels of LDL cholesterol, but elevated levels of non-HDL or apo B,"" said Dr. Vladimir Vuksan, research scientist and associate director of the Risk Factor Modification Centre of St. Michael\'s. ""Barley has a lowering effect on the total bad cholesterol in these high-risk individuals, but can also benefit people without high cholesterol.""\n\nHigh cholesterol and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke, historically treated with medications. However, Dr. Vuksan\'s research and work focuses on how dietary and lifestyle changes can reduce these risk factors.\n\n""Barley\'s positive effect on lowering cholesterol is well-documented and has been included in the Canadian strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk,"" said Dr. Vuksan. ""Health Canada, the FDA and several health authorities worldwide have already approved health claims that barley lowers LDL cholesterol, but this is the first review showing the effects on other harmful lipids.""\n\nDespite its benefits Dr. Vuksan said barley is not as well-established as some other health-recommended foods -- such as oats. Barley consumption by humans has fallen by 35 per cent in the last 10 years. Canada is one of the top five world producers of barley -- almost 10 megatonnes per year -- but human consumption accounts for only two per cent of the crop yield, with livestock making up the other 98 per cent. ""After looking at the evidence, we can also say that barley is comparably effective as oats in reducing overall risk of cardiovascular disease"" said Dr. Vuksan.\n\nBarley is higher in fibre, has twice the protein and almost half the calories of oats, which are important considerations for those with weight or dietary concerns.\n\nDr. Vuksan said barley can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. He recommends trying to incorporate barley into existing recipes, using it as a substitute for rice or even on its own -- just like oatmeal.\n\n###\n\nAbout St. Michael\'s Hospital\n\nSt. Michael\'s Hospital provides compassionate care to all who enter its doors.

Manni suspected that data from normal-weight women obscured the results.\n\nNormal-weight women have less inflammation than heavier women, and are therefore less likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory omega-3s, he said.\n\nTo tease apart the effects, Manni\'s team, working alongside researchers from Emory University and Colorado State University, looked at the influence of prescription omega-3 supplementation on breast density in different weight women. Breast density is a well-established biomarker for breast cancer risk, and may be an independent risk factor, as well.\n\n""The higher the breast density, the more likely the woman will develop breast cancer,"" Manni said.\n\nThe study included 266 healthy postmenopausal women with high breast density detected by routine mammograms. The women either received no treatment, the antiestrogen drug Raloxifene, the prescription omega-3 drug Lovaza or a combination of the two drugs.\n\nAt the conclusion of the two-year study, the researchers found that increasing levels of omega-3 in the blood were associated with reduced breast density—but only in women with a body mass index above 29, bordering on obesity.\n\nAlthough Lovaza contains both of the fatty acids DHA -- 375 milligrams -- and EPA -- 465 milligrams, only DHA blood levels were associated with breast density reduction. The researchers plan to test the effect of DHA alone in obese subjects, potentially in combination with weight loss, in a future trial.\n\n""The finding supports the idea that omega-3s, and specifically DHA, are preferentially protective in obese postmenopausal women,"" Manni said. ""This represents an example of a personalized approach to breast cancer prevention.""\n\nThese findings may help to support future research looking at the direct effect of omega-3 supplementation on breast cancer incidence in obese women.\n\nManni added that, with obesity-related cancers on the rise, the findings could have implications beyond breast cancer.\n\nThe researchers also made a secondary discovery. Lovaza is an omega-3 drug FDA-approved for the treatment of severe high triglycerides at the dose of 4 milligrams daily. In the current study, the combination of Lovaza and a half recommended dose of Raloxifene at 30 milligrams, was superior to the individual treatments in reducing triglycerides and LDL -- “bad” -- cholesterol and increasing HDL -- “good” -- cholesterol.\n\nOther investigators on this project were Narinder Sandhu and Carina Signori, Department of Medicine; Susann E. Schetter, Department of Radiology; Jason Liao and Ana Calcagnotto, Department of Public Health Sciences; John P. Richie, Bogdan Prokopczyk and Neil Trushin, Department of Pharmacology; Cynthia DuBrock, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute; Christopher Hamilton and Laurence M.

Hartman, Emory University; and John McGinley and Henry J. Thompson, Colorado State University.Susan G. Komen for the Cure and Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute funded this research. GlaxoSmith Kline and Eli Lilly supplied Lovaza and Raloxifene, respectively.\n\nAbout Penn State College of MedicineLocated on the campus of Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, Pa., Penn State College of Medicine boasts a portfolio of nearly $82 million in funded research. Projects range from the development of artificial organs and advanced diagnostics to groundbreaking cancer treatments and understanding the fundamental causes of disease.

It totally ignores the fact that the findings overall were negative. The published study reports that the supplement had no impact on reducing high breast density, a biomarker for breast cancer.","This release describes the results of a study testing whether omega-3 fatty acids have a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of breast cancer in obese women by reducing the density of their breast tissue. Higher breast tissue density is recognized as a marker for increased breast cancer risk. The study involved a small group of women who received the omega-3 fatty acid, the omega-3 in tandem with a chemo-preventative drug Raloxifene, the drug alone, or no treatment at all.  According to the release, at the end of two years, women considered obese (their body mass index — BMI — was greater than 29) showed a reduction in breast tissue density, which the researchers argued reduced their cancer risk. However, this is misleading. This finding is from a small subgroup of obese women within the already-small study. The main finding of the study — which is never even mentioned in the news release — is that the supplement had no impact on reducing high breast density whether taken alone or in tandem with Raloxifene. The release also omitted projected costs and harms of the prescription-only supplement used in the study.

Without prompting, the liver breaks down and dispenses with all sorts of toxic compounds, including alcohol and acetaminophen. Anyone who is truly interested in removing poisons from the body should probably spend less time applying detoxifying pads and potions and more time protecting their liver.\n\n\n\nOne way to give your liver a lift is to avoid bombarding it with too many poisons in the first place. In other words, go easy on the tequila and the Tylenol. People who want even more protection can choose from a long list of supplements sold at drugstores, health food stores and grocery stores that purport to protect the liver. The go-to ingredient for liver protection is silymarin, an antioxidant compound found in milk thistle seeds. Almost all liver supplements contain silymarin, either by itself or in combination with other supposedly liver-healthy compounds.\n\n\n\nYou can buy 50 capsules of Nature Made Milk Thistle Extract for about $10. Each capsule contains 98 milligrams of silymarin. Users are instructed to take one capsule two times daily with water before meals. Milk Thistle Liver Cleanse from Nature\'s Secret contains 40 milligrams of silymarin per tablet along with green beet powder, artichoke extract, dandelion extract and a long list of other ingredients. A bottle of 60 tablets costs about $20. Users are instructed to take one tablet twice a day. An 84-caplet bottle of Complete Liver Cleanse from Swanson Health costs about $25. Each caplet contains about 60 milligrams of silymarin along with dandelion, turmeric, artichoke leaf, a ""proprietary fiber blend"" and several other ingredients. The instructions call for taking three capsules in the morning and three at bedtime for two weeks.\n\n\n\nThe claims: The website for Nature Made Milk Thistle says that ""milk thistle is one of the most studied and documented herbs in use today. Scientific research validates its use in healthy liver function."" The label for Liver Cleanse says that the ""botanicals in this product help to enhance vitality and promote liver health by supporting the natural detoxification pathways of the liver."" The Complete Liver Cleanse website says that the product will ""remove toxins and rejuvenate your liver"" during a two-week cleanse.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line: In high doses, silymarin does seem to be good for the liver, says Dr. Leonard B. Seeff, a recently retired senior scientific officer for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. For instance, studies have shown that taking large amounts of the compound intravenously can help slow the virus that causes hepatitis C.\n\n\n\nBut he cautions that commercially available supplements are a completely different story from intravenous injections. ""We can\'t condemn [supplements] out of hand. They warrant careful study,"" he says. But for now, ""there\'s no evidence that any of these products work.""\n\n\n\nSilymarin is an extremely powerful antioxidant, explains Roy L. Hawke, clinical assistant professor of pharmacy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And since oxidation is an important factor in many liver problems — including alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver disease and hepatitis C — he says it\'s reasonable to expect that the compound could protect the liver from harm.\n\n\n\nBut there\'s a problem. When taken orally, silymarin breaks down extremely quickly. In a 2009 study published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, Hawke and colleagues gave oral silymarin supplements to 32 patients with hepatitis C. Subjects received up to 700 milligrams of silymarin every eight hours for seven days, about 10 times more silymarin than they would get from the recommended dose of Nature Made Milk Thistle Extract. Even at these ""heroic"" doses, as Hawke called them, the blood levels fell far short of levels achieved during intravenous studies. Also, the treatment didn\'t seem to have any effect on the liver function, as measured by levels of liver enzymes and viral genetic material in the blood.\n\n\n\nFor people who still want to try a liver supplement, Hawke recommends choosing a pure milk thistle product. In his opinion, artichoke leaf, dandelion and other supplemental bells and whistles don\'t add any proven benefits and might actually block any benefits of silymarin. ""When you add things to milk thistle, you change it in ways that can\'t be predicted,"" he says.\n\n\n\nUntil more is known about the long-term safety, anyone trying a milk thistle supplement should still follow the directions on the bottle and not try to match the huge doses used in studies, he adds. To lower the risk of drug interactions, he tells all of his patients to stop taking any liver supplements before taking a prescription medication for liver disease.\n\n\n\nSeeff sees another reason to stick with pure milk thistle products: Every extra ingredient in a supplement increases the risk of contamination. Though there\'s no clear proof that any supplement can really help the liver, he says, there are many documented cases of herbal remedies causing significant liver damage. ""The view held by many that these products are safe is patently untrue,"" he adds.\n\n\n\nCurious about a consumer health product? Send an e-mail to health@latimes.com.

REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nTests in mice genetically engineered to have a condition similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy showed the drug could improve how the heart works, Joseph Beavoa of the University of Washington and colleagues at the University of North Carolina found.\n\nIt is not clear just how the drug is helping the mice, they reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, but they said it may be worth trying it as a treatment for muscular dystrophy.\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy affects an estimated one in 3,500 males, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive and fatal genetic disorder of muscle degeneration. Patients with DMD lack expression of the protein dystrophin as a result of mutations in the X-linked dystrophin gene,” the researchers wrote.\n\nBecause of the involvement of the X chromosome, boys are far more likely to be affected than girls, who have two copies of the X chromosome and, thus, are likely to have a “spare” copy of the healthy gene.\n\nMuscles all over the body break down as the patient grows up, the heart included. Many patients die of heart failure and most patients with the condition die before age 40.\n\nViagra, known generically as sildenafil, is sold by Pfizer Inc for erectile dysfunction and under the brand name Revatio to treat a heart condition called pulmonary hypertension. It is in a class of drugs called PDE5 inhibitors that work in a variety of ways to increase blood flow.\n\nThe team, working with funds from the NIH and non-profit groups, tested Viagra in mice that had heart damage similar to that seen in muscular dystrophy.\n\nIt slowed the damage and in some cases reversed it, they found.\n\n“Although PDE5 inhibitors will certainly not cure DMD, the current studies suggest that they could be used in combination with current or future therapies,” the researchers wrote.']","This was mouse research – something the bold headline didn’t explain.  So it started and ended badly, failing to challenge a researcher’s writing – ""the current studies suggest that (the drugs) could be used in combination with current or future therapies.""  In mice? Or men?","


 
Readers should care that this report just briefly summarizes one experiment using the active ingredient in Viagra to treat heart problems in mice that were genetically modified to have a condition similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy… without interviewing either the researchers or independent experts… and also failing to note that the drug is already being tested in people that have the actual disease.
We also note a relatively minor point, but still worth noting for anyone who wants to look up the source of the story’s claims. There’s an oft-quoted saying about publicity: ""I don’t care what the newspapers say about me as long as they spell my name right.""

They were presented at an academy meeting and published in the journal Neurology.\n\nMedicines backed by the strongest evidence include anti-seizure drugs (divalproex sodium, sodium valproate and topiramate), blood pressure drugs (metoprolol, propranolol and timolol) and, for menstrual-related migraines, a medicine called frovatriptan, the guidelines say. They also cite strong support for the herbal remedy butterbur and include a longer list of prescription and non-prescription therapies patients can consider.\n\nMore about migraines Migraines are not ordinary headaches. They cause throbbing pain, often on one side of the head, and can come with nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. Visual disturbances or other warning signs, called auras, may precede the headaches. Migraines are three times more common in women than men. In some susceptible people, stress, bright lights, lack of food or sleep, hormonal changes or other triggers may play roles.\n\n\n\nSource: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\n\nThese preventive treatments usually are used daily. The guidelines do not look at the options patients have once symptoms begin.\n\nNot everyone with migraines needs prevention medicine. But nearly 40% have headaches that are so frequent (at least once a week), severe or hard-to-treat that they qualify, Silberstein says. Studies find that just 3% to 13% use the treatments.\n\nWhy so few? One reason is that it\'s hard to persuade people to take medicines on days when they feel fine, says Elizabeth Loder, a neurologist at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston. Silberstein adds that some patients have not been properly diagnosed or made aware of their options. Still others try the treatments and decide they don\'t work or have unacceptable side effects.\n\n""You have a lot of gun-shy patients because of a lot of bad experiences,"" says Michael John Coleman, founder of the patient group MAGNUM, also known as the National Migraine Association. Many spend months or years taking medicines that don\'t work and make them miserable, he says.\n\nThat\'s what happened to Emily Guzan, 26, a lawyer from Pittsburgh who was diagnosed with migraine in 2008. She was given a prescription for Topamax (topiramate), and it ""was a real nightmare,"" she says. She kept having headaches bad enough to land her in an emergency room once a month and suffered nightmares, an altered sense of taste, an unwanted 30-pound weight loss and memory problems — all of which she attributes to the drug.\n\nShe tried some other medications, but for now, she\'s given up on all of them and says she\'s getting better results with diet, yoga and other lifestyle changes.\n\nFinding the right medication for the right patient can take a lot of trial and error and careful dosing, Silberstein says. But about 80% will get relief, he says — defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% — after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.\n\nEven hard-to-treat patients may eventually respond to something, Loder says, so she urges frustrated patients to keep trying.\n\n""The life toll that poorly controlled headaches take is really underappreciated,"" she says. ""You don\'t get back the time you lost at work or the time you lost with your children.""\n\nColeman, of Alexandria, Va., also urges fellow sufferers to keep working with their doctors: His own migraines took 40 years to control. ""This is not a cookie-cutter disease and there is no magic bullet, but there is hope.""']",This story about new migraine prevention guidelines didn’t mention the industry conflicts that pervade the writing committee that issued the recommendations.,"However, we were pleased to see that story raised some appropriately skeptical concerns about the potential harms of headache prevention drugs. We also applaud the story’s inclusion of an unconventional patient anecdote — someone who tried multiple medications, experienced no benefit, and ultimately opted for lifestyle changes to manage her symptoms. A discussion of costs, and a more thorough evaluation of the evidence underlying the medications discussed in the story, would have been welcome additions to the coverage.

Crossing the street and tying his shoes became challenges, and colleagues noticed he was limping at work.\n\nOn a recent morning, Mr. Burk reported to the Hospital for Joint Diseases, part of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, for hip-replacement surgery. His surgeon had promised him a better quality of life, and said both the operation and recovery would be quick.\n\nAbout an hour later Mr. Burk was out of surgery. By 4 p.m. that afternoon he was upstairs in a ward, walking on crutches down the hall and going up and down a small model staircase. At 6 p.m., he left the hospital and headed home with his wife to Northern New Jersey, where he had a bowl of chicken soup.\n\nMr. Burk, 54 years old, had what NYU Langone calls same-day hip-replacement surgery, which practitioners say offers faster recovery times and less postoperative pain. With traditional hip surgery, patients typically spend days recovering in the hospital and may need additional time in a rehabilitation center.\n\nHip replacement, formally known as total hip arthroplasty, is considered one of the most effective surgeries in medicine, enabling the vast majority of patients to walk again pain-free. More than 340,000 of the operations are performed in the U.S. a year and include a growing number of patients in their 40s and 50s who want to maintain an active lifestyle.\n\nMichael Burk talks with his surgeon Roy Davidovitch at NYU Langone’s Hospital for Joint Diseases in the morning before his anterior hip replacement.

In the traditional surgical method, known as the posterior approach, surgeons cut through muscle, tendons and tissues in the patient’s backside to get to the hip joint. The arthritic joint is removed and a prosthetic joint akin to a ball and socket is implanted, enabling the patient to move with greater ease.\n\nRoy Davidovitch, who operated on Mr. Burk, is one of a growing number of surgeons offering the same-day hip-replacement technique. Dr. Davidovitch, director of NYU Langone’s Hip Center, uses a so-called anterior approach. He makes a four-inch incision in front of the hip, close to the groin, before going in to install the new joint. The procedure is performed through what he calls a “natural interval,” or opening between muscles, thereby avoiding cutting through muscle and tendons as with the posterior approach.\n\nDr. Davidovitch has performed about 100 same-day hip replacements in the past year. There have been no complications and only one hospital readmission for several hours when a patient reacted to the anesthesia, he says.\n\nJoel Matta, an orthopedic surgeon at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., was an early adopter of the method in the U.S. and has performed more than 4,000 anterior hip replacements over the past 20 years. Dr. Matta, who helped train Dr. Davidovitch, designed a special operating table to help surgeons manipulate the patient’s legs and body to improve access to the surgical site.\n\nAs many as 26% of member surgeons performing hip replacements in the U.S. use the anterior method, according to a survey by the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons. The technique is considered harder to master partly because the surgeon has less room to maneuver around the joint than with the posterior approach. But some surgical experts say there isn’t sufficient data to assert the technique is superior to traditional methods.\n\nMr. Burk was walking up a small model staircase by 4 p.m. that afternoon. Photo: Ryan Jaslow/NYU Langone Medical Center\n\nJay Lieberman, president of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, says more studies are needed. “We don’t know which is the best approach,” says Dr. Lieberman, who is chairman of orthopedics at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n\nSome doctors question whether it is safe for patients to go home after hip surgery without spending a night being monitored in a hospital. “We should be careful,” says Vincent Pellegrini, orthopedics chair at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. “It is still a big operation.”\n\nSome research gives anterior hip replacement procedures a slight edge over the traditional technique. “Is it the cat’s meow? The answer is, somewhat,” says Jose Rodriguez, vice chairman of orthopedics at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, a part of Northwell Health, who has published studies comparing the different surgical approaches. “There is less muscle injury” and a patient’s early recovery is “definitely better,” says Dr. Rodriguez, who favors the anterior method in his own practice.\n\nAlthough more patients getting anterior surgery are able to perform physical tasks more quickly, those receiving traditional surgery catch up after about six weeks. At that point “there is no difference” in how patients fare, Dr. Rodriguez says.\n\nMost patients fully recover from hip replacement after about three to six months regardless of surgical approach, doctors say. By then, the bone has largely grown over the implant and it is safely affixed.\n\nA special surgical table, like this one at NYU Langone, is used for same-day hip replacement surgery. It lets surgeons position the leg so that they can make an incision from the front, a so-called anterior approach. Photo: NYU Langone\n\nAnterior hip replacement patients often need less pain medication after surgery, practitioners of the technique say, although this varies by the individual. Other surgeons disagree, saying pain levels depend on pain management, not surgical approach.\n\nBefore getting same-day hip-replacement surgery at NYU in January, Barbara Ross, of Suffern, N.Y., was in near-constant, severe pain, she says. The day after the procedure she took “one or two Vicodins,” a narcotic painkiller, and since then, “absolutely nothing,” she says. “I am 100% better than I have been in years.” Ms. Ross, 62, is back at work running her public relations firm.\n\nMultiple departments had to be on board when NYU launched its same-day hip-replacement program in 2015, including the chairman of orthopedics, Joseph Zuckerman. Dr. Zuckerman says he now wants to expand same-day hip replacement surgery to other approaches and other joints. The hospital has spent nearly $200,000 over the years on two special operating tables for the surgery.\n\nDr. Davidovitch says he needed a shorter-lasting anesthesia that would let patients get out of bed and walk the same afternoon. Mitchell Marshall, chief of anesthesiology for the Hospital for Joint Diseases, says his division was enthusiastic, but needed to make sure it could be done safely. The outcome: A spinal anesthetic that lasts 90 minutes, as opposed to the more than three-hour anesthesia standard for traditional hip surgery.\n\n“At first, there was a lot of anxiety,” recalls nurse manager Ella Blot. “But we would see [patients] going home and we’d say, amazing.” To Ms. Blot, a 23-year nursing veteran, “the world has changed. They used to stay here two weeks, then 10 days, seven days, suddenly four days, two days” after hip-replacement surgery.\n\nKeith Berend, senior partner at Joint Implant Surgeons in New Albany, Ohio, prefers the anterior approach. “It makes perfect sense that cutting no muscles will result in the fastest recovery,” he says. Still, other partners at the practice use another technique, called the lateral approach, in which the surgeon approaches the hip joint from the side. In all cases, patients at the facility go home the same day, he says.\n\nJeffrey Leeds, 59 years old, had same-day hip replacement surgery in November. He was back at work as a private-equity investor within days. Photo: Elizabeth Leeds\n\n“The experience of the surgeon, the efficiency of the team and the pain-management protocols” are the most crucial variables that make a same-day operation possible, Dr. Berend says.\n\nJeffrey Leeds, a 59-year-old private-equity investor in New York City, had same-day hip surgery at NYU in November. He says he was in so much pain before the operation that if he sat on the ground to play with his 2-year-old daughter, he couldn’t stand up.\n\nPain after the surgery was minimal, he says, and Tylenol was all he needed. Mr. Leeds was back at work within days: “My colleagues were hoping for a slower recovery,” he jokes.\n\nWrite to Lucette Lagnado at lucette.lagnado@wsj.com']","Despite many expert opinions and patient voices in this story, we were left wanting more from the coverage.","A patient profiled in the WSJ story — one of three overwhelmingly positive anecdotes.

Lots of sources, lots of reporting, and lots to praise in this story. But the story would have been lots better with a few more key facts and figures and a more balanced look at traditional surgery.
For example, the orthopedist member of our team wonders: Where did the story get the idea that traditional surgery involves three hours of anesthesia? That isn’t accurate. And while the story features three glowing anecdotes, we would’ve preferred to see more emphasis on the evidence that supports same-day surgery and the various approaches discussed. Finally, we think many readers will come away with the impression that a surgery that took a little bit longer to perform was somehow not as good. That’s unfortunate. The surgery is meant to last 20 years so it’s most important to get it right and assure a good long-term outcome. The story could have emphasized this fact more.

The PSA test is notoriously unreliable, but using it this way separates men who need a close watch from those who are so low-risk that they can skip testing for five years or more.\n\n-Screening women with no symptoms for ovarian cancer with a blood test and an ultrasound exam is harmful. It didn\'t prevent deaths and led to thousands of false alarms, unneeded surgeries and serious complications.\n\nThe last study is a warning to people who get screening tests that aren\'t recommended, or who question whether screening can ever hurt.\n\n""The answer is, it could hurt a lot,"" said Dr. Allen Lichter, chief executive of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The group published these and 4,000 other studies Wednesday, ahead of its annual meeting next month.\n\nCervical cancer is easy to prevent. It\'s very slow-growing and screening finds precancerous cells and allows early treatment. The new study was the first big one to examine a newer screening tool, HPV tests, with or without Pap smears in routine practice.\n\nFor a Pap test, cells scraped from the cervix, the gateway to the uterus, are checked under a microscope. But this can miss problems or raise false alarms.\n\nHPV tests detect the human papillomavirus, which causes most cases of cervical cancer. But HPV is ""the common cold"" of the nether regions — most sexually active young people have been exposed to it, said Debbie Saslow, the American Cancer Society\'s director of breast and gynecologic cancer. Most infections go away on their own; they\'re only a cancer risk when they last a year or more.\n\nYounger women tend to have short-term infections, so Pap tests are a better way to screen them. HPV tests are approved as an option along with Paps for women 30 and older, and the cancer society says that if a woman tests negative on both, she can wait three years to be screened again. Few take this advice, though.\n\n""Women still want their annual Pap and doctors still want to give them,"" and think it\'s rationing care to test less often, Saslow said.\n\nThe new study gives ""very, very solid support"" for screening less often, Lichter said.\n\nHormuzd Katki of the National Cancer Institute studied more than 330,000 women getting HPV and Pap tests through Kaiser Permanente Northern California for five years.\n\nOnly about three out of 100,000 women each year developed cervical cancer after negative HPV and Pap tests. HPV tests were twice as good as Paps for predicting risk. Adding a Pap after a negative HPV test did little to improve risk prediction.\n\nHowever, if an HPV test was positive, a Pap test helped confirm or rule out the need for follow-up.\n\nThe study didn\'t look at the downside of HPV testing — how many false alarms and needless procedures it triggered. HPV tests cost $80 to $100 compared to $20 to $40 for Paps.\n\nThe prostate study sought a better way to use PSA tests, which are troublesome because PSA can be high for many reasons besides cancer, and doctors don\'t know which cancers need treatment or whether screening saves lives. Most groups don\'t recommend PSA tests, but most men over 50 get them anyway.\n\nThe new study ""is not going to end the controversy, but it suggests a very interesting middle ground,"" Lichter said.\n\nResearchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York used stored blood samples that 12,000 Swedish men gave for a heart study decades ago, when most were 44 to 50 years old. They also had second samples from some of them six years later, and samples from other 60-year-old men.\n\nLooking 27 years later, researchers saw that 44 percent of cancer deaths occurred in men whose initial PSAs had been in the top 10 percent when they were 44 to 50 years old.\n\nConversely, scoring below the median meant very little cancer risk years later.\n\n""They\'re identifying a group of guys who don\'t need to be screened, or need to be screened less often,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, the cancer society\'s chief medical officer.\n\nThe results are ""provocative,"" but this type of study can\'t prove that screening prevents deaths, said Dr. Matthew R. Smith of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. Few of the Swedish men were treated for prostate cancer as most men are today, which can affect survival.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute, the Swedish Cancer Society and several foundations paid for the work, and one researcher holds patents for two PSA-related tests.\n\nBaseline PSA tests for men in their 40s can\'t be recommended yet, Brawley said. The cancer society says men should be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA tests starting at age 50, and sooner for blacks and those with family history of prostate cancer.\n\nThe government-funded ovarian cancer study involved nearly 80,000 women. Half were screened annually with an ultrasound for four years and a blood test for six years. The blood test looked for CA-125, a substance often elevated in ovarian cancer.\n\nAfter 13 years, there were no major differences in ovarian cancers found or deaths from the disease. Screening found only 212 cancers while giving 3,285 false alarms that led to 1,080 unneeded biopsy surgeries and 163 serious complications.\n\n""So many people say `how can cancer screening be harmful?\' This thing documents it,"" Brawley said.\n\nThe results don\'t apply to using these tests on women with symptoms of ovarian cancer or abnormal physical exams. That\'s still the best way to check for ovarian cancer in those cases.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Rarely do we see so much information gathered and presented in such a clear, compelling way, giving readers appropriate context to understand the evidence on various cancer screenings. </span></span>"," By using clear language, the story tells readers exactly what they need to know saying, for example, “Screening women with no symptoms for ovarian cancer with a blood test and an ultrasound exam is harmful” and “Cervical cancer is easy to prevent.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if everyone 50 or older were regularly screened, as many as 60% of deaths could be avoided.\n\nBut Dr. Michael Zalis, a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells the Health Blog that many people may avoid this procedure because the preparation, which requires patients to cleanse their colons with a laxative, is so unpleasant. In addition, some patients fear the instrument used in the procedure, or have concerns about the risks from anesthesia or of perforation of the bowel.\n\n“No one should be dying from colon cancer, which is almost completely preventable with screening; and if it were sufficiently easy more people would do it,” says Zalis, lead author of the study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nIn recent years, the use of computed tomographic colonography—known as CT or “virtual” colonoscopy—has eliminated the need for the most invasive part of the procedure. But though these virtual scans are performed externally, patients still have to take the laxatives so the scanning machines can read the empty colon.\n\nSo, the researchers developed a software program to electronically “cleanse” the bowel, Zalis says. Prior to a scan, researchers asked patients to adhere to a low-fiber diet for a few days and drink a special fluid to “tag” the colon’s contents. After performing the CT scan, the software electronically identified polyps.\n\nThe researchers screened 605 patients with the laxative-free CT scan and followed up with traditional colonoscopy to find out how successfully the virtual method detected precancerous polyps of six millimeters or more. The laxative-free scan accurately identified 91% of patients with polyps of 10 mm or larger -- those at highest risk of becoming cancerous -- but was less accurate for smaller lesions, the study says.\n\nDr. James Aisenberg, a gastroenterologist and clinical professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, agrees that, for some people, the laxative requirement can be a barrier to colorectal screening.\n\nHowever, like virtual colonoscopy in general, laxative-free CTC “will miss a subset of precancerous polyps and thus is unlikely to become the gold standard for colorectal-cancer prevention,” says Dr. Aisenberg, who wasn’t involved with the study.\n\nHowever, the laxative-free method “may become a useful alternative for persons who won't otherwise undergo screening, and is much better than no screening at all.”\n\nDr. Zalis and some of his co-investigators developed the software. The American Cancer Society, the National Institutes of Health and General Electric Co.’s health-care unit—which markets scanning devices and accessories—supported the researchers. Dr. Zalis says the company had no influence on the study.""]","Overall, this was an easy-to-follow summary.  But there was a clear difference between this and a ","This story about a new way of performing a virtual colonoscopy explains what it does, what it does not do and why it probably won’t become a replacement for old-fashioned “scope procedures.” The story could have taken some cues, though, from a competing story in the Boston Globe that talked about costs and offered an exploration of alternatives that was missing here.

But few of those suicide survivors get the follow-up care they need at a time when they are especially likely to attempt suicide again.\n\nNow, a study shows that a simple intervention conducted by staff in emergency departments can reduce the risk of future attempts. The intervention involves creating a safety plan for each patient and following up with phone calls after discharge.\n\n""It reduced the odds of suicidal behavior by half,"" says Barbara Stanley, a psychologist at Columbia University and the lead author of the study. ""That\'s a phenomenal difference.""\n\nThe study, which was published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, included 1,200 patients at five Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country. The findings offer a way for hospitals and clinics to help reduce the rising numbers of death by suicide across the country.\n\nYou Are Not Alone If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (en Español: 1-888-628-9454; deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting 741741.\n\n""When someone goes to the emergency room for a suicide attempt, they are at risk of another suicide attempt for the next three months,"" says Stanley. ""It\'s like a ticking time bomb.""\n\nThis is the first large-scale study of the Safety Planning Intervention, which Stanley and her group developed in 2008 and which has been adopted at hospitals and clinics around the country. It can be provided by a physician, a nurse or a social worker and requires very little training.\n\n""The interesting thing about the Safety Planning Intervention is that it is a relatively brief intervention and can be used in a lot of different [health care] settings,"" says Brian Ahmedani, director of behavioral health research at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who wasn\'t involved in the new study.\n\nMany health care systems are starting to think about ways to prevent suicide, he says. That\'s because, as his own work has shown, almost 83 percent of people who die by suicide make a health care visit in the year before their death. Yet only 50 percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness.\n\nThe intervention studied by Stanley and her group starts in the ER or a clinic, before the suicidal patient is released. First, a health care professional talks with the patient and tries to understand that person\'s warning signs for a suicide attempt.\n\n""If they\'ve grappled with being suicidal, they know what their warning signs are,"" says Stanley. For example, she says, someone might say, "" \'I find that I\'m staying in my room, not answering the phone, not answering texts, not answering emails.\' That could be a warning sign."" Others might have repeated thoughts that they\'re not worthy.\n\nThe next step is for the patient — with help from the clinician — to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation.\n\nFor most people, this intense state only lasts from a few minutes to a couple of hours, she says.\n\nThe coping strategy could be something as simple as playing video games, watching TV or talking to a loved one.\n\nIf people contemplating suicide can distract themselves with something they enjoy doing, they can bypass that narrow window during which suicidal thoughts can overpower them, notes Stanley. ""For suicidal people, the passage of time is their friend,"" she says.\n\nThe provider also tries to persuade patients to remove or distance themselves from their means of suicide. For example, if they own a gun, they should lock it away or give it to someone who can keep it away from them. ""If you make it really hard to use whatever means you were going to use, time passes and you give a chance for suicidal thoughts to subside,"" she says.\n\nSafety planning includes follow-up phone calls with the patient — the first call is made within 72 hours of being discharged from the ER. The provider asks the patient how the safety plan is being used and helps revise it if needed. The provider also makes sure the patient sees a mental health care provider for long-term care. A provider keeps calling until the patient has had a second appointment with a therapist or counselor.\n\nThat follow-up is key, says Julie Goldstein Grumet, a psychologist at the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.\n\n""People often fall off and they don\'t follow up on their referrals,"" she says. ""And the times during these transitions from acute care settings is one of the highest risk times of suicides.""\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, Stanley\'s team looked at five VA emergency departments across the country that used it and compared the outcomes with four VA emergency rooms that simply discharge patients after stabilizing them.\n\nAmong the nearly 1,200 people who received the intervention, half as many people had made suicide attempts (or had come very close) as those in the control group. In other words, the intervention had nearly halved the risk of suicide in the six months after discharge. Two-thirds of the people in the treatment group had used their safety plans, and they were also twice as likely to get follow-up mental health treatment when compared with the control group.\n\n""The study is incredibly important ... because it shows brief interventions work,"" says Goldstein Grumet.\n\nRick, a father in Missouri, says a safety plan may have saved his 12-year-old daughter\'s life. (NPR is leaving off his last name to protect his daughter\'s privacy.)\n\nIn September 2017, she came very close to taking her own life. When he found out about this from her school principal the next day, Rick rushed her to the ER at Mercy Hospital Jefferson. ""The whole process was overwhelming, because you have your 12-year-old who\'s wanting to end her life,"" Rick says. ""And she\'d not shared any of that with us.""\n\nThe hospital wasn\'t part of the new study but was also using a safety planning intervention as part of its efforts to prevent suicides.\n\n""The crisis counselor did such an amazing job of setting up a safety plan that my daughter felt comfortable with,"" he says.\n\nHe says his daughter didn\'t want to talk to him or her mother about her struggles, but she agreed to communicate with them in other ways. During times when she felt her urge to take her own life coming back, she agreed to watch TV with her mother or call or text her father.\n\nRick says she usually sends a specific emoji when she is having a bad day. And he responds by distracting her with something completely different.\n\nHe says she also agreed to use a crisis help line if things escalated.\n\n""It was something that she could follow through with,"" he says. ""It gave her some confidence and it gave me some confidence.""\n\nHe says the plan has helped his daughter get through her suicidal phase and even slowly open up to her parents.\n\n""That\'s what is so powerful about a safety plan,"" says Ahmedani. ""The patient is the author of their safety plan, but it\'s guided by a provider.""\n\nAs part of the 2012 National Strategy For Suicide Prevention, many health care providers have adopted the approaches to prevention outlined in the Zero Suicide Initiative, which includes safety planning based on previous evidence showing it works.\n\nWhile safety planning has begun to be used across the country, it ought to be adopted universally, says Goldstein Grumet.\n\n""It is a brief intervention that hospital workers, primary care staff, outpatient behavioral health, can all be trained in to utilize,"" she says.']",News stories must be careful to explain study limitations so that people come away understanding what a study ,"This article reports results of a study on the effectiveness of the Safety Planning Intervention (SPI), a simple intervention conducted by staff in emergency departments when a patient has been treated for an attempted suicide. The intervention involves creating a safety plan for each patient and following up with phone calls after discharge.
The story — and the study that it’s based on — both tout that SPI reduced the risk of short-term suicidal behavior in half. That’s a misleading way to frame the results. More precisely, 3.03% of the patients who received the SPI intervention engaged in suicidal behavior within six months of discharge, compared to 5.29% of those receiving usual care. This is a key example of why news stories should report the absolute risk reduction.

While patients have access to more quality treatment therapies than ever before, the disease is still regarded as an incurable condition that often leads to death for those affected.\n\nHowever, researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Division of Hematology and Oncology are leading and currently recruiting for a Phase II clinical trial that intends to provide newly diagonosed multiple myeloma patients an innovative treatment plan. The hope is that the therapies will eradicate the disease in a significant proportion of patients and measure disease response more accurately than ever before.\n\nThe clinical trial Monoclonal Antibody Sequential Therapy for Deep Remission in Multiple Myeloma, also known as MASTER, utilizes next generation sequencing technology to detect minimal residual disease down to a level of one cancer cell in 100,000 — or 100- to 1,000-fold more sensitive than traditional methods to evaluate response. With a goal of enrolling 82 patients, those in the trial will be treated with a combination of anti-myeloma agents and immunotherapy that have a proven record of eliminating minimal residual disease, including the drug carfilzomib and the monoclonal antibody daratumumab, agents that are currently only approved to treat patients whose disease has returned.\n\n“I believe for the first time that we have treatments that are effective enough to make it possible to eradicate multiple myeloma definitively in a substantial proportion of patients, along with having the technology to detect that the disease has been targeted and that treatment can be stopped,” said Luciano Costa, M.D., Ph.D., scientist at the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center, lead of the Hematologic-Malignancy Working Group, and principal investigator of the MASTER study. “That is what patients want, after all — a treatment that gives them the possibility of eliminating any trace of the myeloma without having to be on therapy for the rest of their lives. It is a bold move, but bold moves are what our patients deserve.""\n\nMultiple myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer in the U.S., impacting more than 25,000 people each year and disproportionatly affecting African-American men.\n\nThis is one of the first trials in multiple myeloma to use minimal residual disease as primary endpoint and the very first one to modify therapy based on achievement of minimal residual disease eradication.\n\nUp until now, existing therapies have been developed on trials that assigned treatment for a defined duration of time, irrespective of depth or speed of response, often followed by maintenance therapy for indefinite duration and with potentially adverse impact on risk of complications and cost. As it stands, patients with billions of cancer cells in their bodies and patients with true disease eradication will both appear to be in complete remission using current methods to measure disease response to therapy.\n\nMore than improving the results of the initial treatment, the MASTER study will treat patients for the necessary time to confirm elimination of minimal residual disease and then discontinue therapy. Patients will be monitored for relapse at the molecular level, before disease becomes again symptomatic.\n\nIn addition to UAB’s study leadership, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Duke University, Medical College of Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin, and Oregon Health and Science University are recruiting for the trial as well.\n\nThe MASTER trial is supported by Amgen and Janseen, both with drug and finaincial support.']","The release neglects to mention that even after this phase 2 trial has been completed, researchers won’t know if the experimental drug cocktail is better or worse than standard treatments, because it does not include any direct comparison.","This news release about a test of combination drug therapy in people newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma blood cancer slathers on hopes and promises, while neglecting caveats, potential harms and essential context. The release neglects to point out that even after this phase 2 trial has been completed, researchers won’t know if the experimental drug cocktail is better or worse than standard treatments, because it does not include any direct comparison. The release puffs up the threat of multiple myeloma, which accounts for less than 2 percent of cancer cases in the US. It does not explain that patients would be responsible for many of the costs of this treatment, in part because of overlaps with standard care. The release does report support from pharmaceutical companies that make two of the drugs to be used.

""Our study could have a profound impact in the developing world where access to radiography is limited.""\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in chest X-rays in the investigational arm resulted in an overall cost savings of $9,200, and length of stay in the Emergency Department was decreased by 26 minutes.\n\n""In the era of precision medicine, lung ultrasound may also be an ideal imaging option in children who are at higher risk for radiation-induced cancers or have received multiple radiographic or CT imaging studies,"" says Dr. Tsung.\n\nAs more and more handheld ultrasound machines come to market, these results suggest that lung ultrasound has the potential to become the preferred choice for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of lung ultrasound on antibiotic use and stewardship.\n\n###\n\nAbout the Mount Sinai Health System\n\nThe Mount Sinai Health System is an integrated health system committed to providing distinguished care, conducting transformative research, and advancing biomedical education. Structured around seven hospital campuses and a single medical school, the Health System has an extensive ambulatory network and a range of inpatient and outpatient services--from community-based facilities to tertiary and quaternary care.\n\nThe System includes approximately 6,100 primary and specialty care physicians; 12 joint-venture ambulatory surgery centers; more than 140 ambulatory practices throughout the five boroughs of New York City, Westchester, Long Island, and Florida; and 31 affiliated community health centers. Physicians are affiliated with the renowned Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which is ranked among the highest in the nation in National Institutes of Health funding per investigator. The Mount Sinai Hospital is ranked as one of the nation\'s top 10 hospitals in Geriatrics, Cardiology/Heart Surgery, and Gastroenterology, and is in the top 25 in five other specialties in the 2014-2015 ""Best Hospitals"" issue of U.S. News & World Report. Mount Sinai\'s Kravis Children\'s Hospital also is ranked in seven out of ten pediatric specialties by U.S. News & World Report. The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai is ranked 11th nationally for Ophthalmology, while Mount Sinai Beth Israel is ranked regionally.']","Substituting lung ultrasound for chest X-ray in children looks advantageous in this release, but the lack of data on diagnostic accuracy is concerning.","This Mount Sinai news release describes a small study aimed at testing whether chest ultrasounds are as effective at diagnosing pneumonia in children as chest X-rays, the current diagnostic method of choice. Patients were randomized into either a test group, which received a chest ultrasound and a possible follow-up chest X-ray, versus a control group which received first a chest X-ray and then a chest ultrasound. The release does a good job of explaining the study results, and the potential cost savings here and in lesser-developed countries. Weaknesses are no mention of an investigator’s consulting relationship to an ultrasound company and lack of discussion of study limitations.

""I think the most important part of this breakthrough is the bigger percentage of people who responded.""\n\nThe study, which is published in the Aug. 26 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, was funded by drug makers Plexxikon and Roche Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAbout nine years ago, scientists discovered that the tumors of about half of patients with melanoma have a mutation in a gene called BRAF.\n\nThe gene appears to help drive the runaway cell division that is a hallmark of cancer. ""It\'s always on. It\'s always signaling to the nucleus [of the tumor cells] that it\'s time to divide,"" Chapman explained.\n\nThat finding opened the door to potential targeted, molecular therapies for melanoma, which has been sorely lacking in effective treatments.\n\nPLX4032 is the first potent inhibitor of BRAF that has made it to the clinical trial stage, Chapman said.\n\nIn the trial, 55 patients received escalating doses of the drug. Ten of 16 patients who had the BRAF gene mutation had a partial response to the drug, meaning the tumor shrank by at least 30 percent, while one had a complete response, with the tumor disappearing altogether.\n\nAmong 32 patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma in the second phase of the study, 24 had a partial response and two had a complete response.\n\n""It worked: 81 percent had a partial response -- which has never been seen. I don\'t know of any solid tumors that have a response rate that high,"" said Chapman. ""What\'s different here is that we\'ve discovered a molecule that is responsible for driving the melanoma cell. It turns out that the melanoma really cares if we block the gene BRAF. It matters. It\'s addicted to this pathway.""\n\nThere are some important caveats, however. It\'s not known at this time if the drug can improve overall survival, and a sizable proportion of participants developed resistance to the drug, the researchers say.\n\nThe findings join other recent reports of potential treatments for melanoma in what appears to be an exciting time for the field. Progress in this field has essentially been stalled for decades, experts say.\n\nRecently, scientists reported that another experimental drug, ipilimumab, prolonged median survival in patients with metastatic melanoma from 6.4 months to 10 months.\n\n""[Existing therapy] is not good for melanoma, so this is really a new opportunity that I think may have some importance to people,"" Pentland said.\n\nHowever, she stressed that the best defense against melanoma is to get your skin examined regularly by a professional who knows what to look for.\n\n""Our most successful treatment is to get [the lesion] early, get it before it\'s thick, get it before it spreads,"" she said.\n\nMore information\n\nThere\'s more on metastatic melanoma at the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Of the three competing stories we reviewed on this topic, this HealthDay piece did the best job of clearly laying out the limitations of the new research.

Now health officials are warning doctors that preventing the disease will take more than just writing a prescription.\n\nThe pill, called Truvada, is already on the market for treating HIV infections. But the landmark study, involving 2,500 men who have sex with men, showed that taking Truvada faithfully can reduce the risk of infection by as much as 92 percent.\n\nThat touched off a lot of celebrating. It's the first time anybody's shown that taking a pill can prevent HIV – and it was the first new weapon against HIV unveiled in many years.\n\nTo make sure it works, though, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says doctors need to do a number of things:\n\nPrescribe Truvada only for men at high risk of getting infected – that is, only for men who have sex with men, those who have multiple sex partners, and those who live in areas where there's a lot of HIV circulating.\n\nTest patients before prescribing it to make sure they're not already infected. That'll help avoid creating viruses resistant to the drug when patients miss doses. For the same reason, patients should get an HIV test periodically while on the drug.\n\nCounsel patients on Truvada to use condoms faithfully, because the drug isn't a sure bet against the virus.\n\nAbove all, tell patients they must take the drug every day – not just when they've had risky sex.\n\nThe study makes that last point very clear. Overall, men who took Truvada had a 44 percent lower risk of HIV infection. But those who said they took the drug at least 9 out of every 10 day had a 73 percent lower risk.\n\nThat doesn't tell the whole story. When researchers tested the blood of patients for traces of Truvada, they found many who claimed to have taken the pill regularly weren't telling the truth. Among those whose tests showed they really did take it every day, the risk of HIV infection was 92 percent lower than those not on the drug.\n\nThere's one other thing, the CDC says. Make sure patients understand that warding off HIV isn't cheap. Each pill currently costs around $36, which adds up to more than $13,000 a year.

Rather, they said that for certain patients who may not be eligible for more standard surgical approaches, the therapy has potential as an alternative means for offering an improved quality of life for a longer period of time.\n\n""\'Promising\' is the perfect way to describe our findings,"" said study lead author Dr. David Woodrum, an interventional radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ""But whether or not this minimally invasive approach would ultimately become a primary method of treatment in the future will depend on the long-term results of this trial, which is still under way. At this point I would say that cryoablation has the most applicability as a kind of last-ditch treatment for patients who are not good surgical candidates for a variety of reasons.""\n\nWoodrum and his colleagues are scheduled to discuss their findings Sunday in New Orleans at the annual meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology. Funding for their work was provided by Galil Medical, a medical device manufacturer based in Arden Hills, Minn.\n\nBecause this study was presented at a medical meeting, the conclusions should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute points out that while cryoablation (also known as cryosurgery) is a well-known practice, researchers are still in the process of assessing its long-term benefits.\n\nThe procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist on patients coping with metastasized lung tumors, the researchers noted. Using CT-imaging equipment, the physician inserts a small needle-like instrument directly into the tumor to deliver the freezing power (at temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius) of liquid nitrogen to cancer cells, while sparing healthy surrounding tissue.\n\nTo date, the team behind the new study has used the procedure to tackle a total of 36 tumors in 22 American and French patients --13 men and nine women -- whose average age was 60. Fifteen patients had just one tumor, while the rest had two or more. None of the patients was deemed eligible for standard surgical interventions.\n\nThe targeted tumors were less than 3.5 centimeters (about 1.4 inches), which Woodrum described as being ""small to medium in size.""\n\nThe procedure was performed under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation, and lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to nearly three hours. Typically, patients were able to return home the following day.\n\nThe result: Among the 15 patients seen roughly three months post-procedure, tumor control was found to be 100 percent, although six patients were found to have developed new lung tumors in the interim.\n\nAmong five patients seen six months after the procedure, tumor control continued to be 100 percent.\n\nThe authors noted that side effects were minimal, typically involving air or fluid around the lungs after the procedure, and in all cases were resolved quickly.\n\nThe team concluded that cryoablation appears to be both safe and effective, at least in the short-term. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment\'s impact over the long haul.\n\n""It would be overreaching to say that we\'re curing cancer with this,"" Woodrum said. ""But this is one of many therapy options that is looking to turn cancer into a chronic fight, and to give patients for whom the choices are limited a chance at a good quality of life with minimal treatment complications.""\n\nFor his part, Dr. David Carbone, a professor and director of the James Thoracic Center at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that the findings regarding cryoablation are ""not incredibly novel,"" given that the procedure has been around for years.\n\n""And I would say that there are multiple different technologies for doing this kind of very localized approach,"" he added. He mentioned stereotactic radiosurgery -- which targets the tumor with high-power X-rays -- as another way to go.\n\n""While I\'ve done cryoablation myself in the past, it\'s not what I typically do,"" Carbone noted. ""Stereotactic is noninvasive and doesn\'t require general anesthesia, so that\'s what I\'d tend to do, although certainly what approach is ideal will depend on a particular patient\'s situation and symptoms. But there\'s no situation in which cryoablation would be the only theoretical option.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about cryoablation, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']","If the independent expert you interview states that the findings are “not incredibly novel,” then why is this newsworthy?","The story actually came very close to being a quite complete story.  But it made silly, clumsy mistakes in wording – all easily fixed.  But since they weren’t fixed, the story, as published, was frustratingly incomplete.  Read the full review to learn more.

While some people improve with customized diets that avoid certain foods that trigger symptoms, this approach doesn’t help everyone and some emerging research suggests that the condition may also be influenced by processes in the brain.\n\nFor the current analysis, researchers examined data from 53 trials that compared the effects of antidepressants or psychotherapy, either alone or in combination, versus placebo treatments or “usual management” in people with IBS.\n\nRates of “no relief” were highest with placebo treatments. People were 34 percent less likely to have no relief from antidepressants and 31 percent less likely to get no relief from psychotherapy, the study found.\n\n“One component of IBS is increased sensitivity to the functions of the bowels; simply summarized, this means either the nerves taking messages from the bowel to the brain are more sensitive or that the brain is more attentive or reacts in a more emotional manner to the normal messages arising in the bowel, or both,” said Dr. Michael Camilleri, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn’t involved in the current study.\n\n“Since there are really no medications to reduce the nerve sensitivity, some doctors give medications that modulate the function of the brain in the hope that this approach will reduce the ability to sense or emotionally react to the signals or messages arriving from the bowels,” Camilleri said by email.\n\nPsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and somatisation - physical symptoms thought to have psychological origins - are common among people with IBS, researchers note in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.\n\nAlthough the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note.\n\nOne limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note. Another drawback is that these studies weren’t designed to prove how antidepressants or psychotherapy might directly improve IBS symptoms.\n\nStill, a psychological evaluation may make sense for IBS patients because it’s possible their symptoms might be a byproduct of untreated depression, said Dr. Agnieszka Kulak-Bejda, a psychiatry researcher at the Medical University of Białystok in Poland who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\nAntidepressants may work better for certain types of IBS, and the study findings also suggest that the type of medication may matter, Kulak-Bejda said by email.\n\nA family of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants were more effective at relieving global symptoms of IBS, the analysis found. But another family of medicines known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was better than a placebo for easing symptoms like pain and bloating and improving quality of life.\n\n“The decision to use antidepressants as a form of therapy should be taken individually,” Kulak-Bejda said. “The decision should be made after considering all the pros and cons.”\n\nLead author Dr. Alexander Ford of the University of Leeds in the U.K. didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nSOURCE: go.nature.com/2QXSV2K The American Journal of Gastroenterology, online September 3, 2018.']",The article does a good job of addressing the limitations of the research and incorporating input from independent experts.,"The story focuses on a recently published journal article that evaluates the available research on whether antidepressants or psychotherapy may reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Chan School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from a large, ongoing, national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women\'s health.\n\n""The results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high-fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life. High consumption of foods rich in fiber such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains in early life may help to reduce breast cancer incidence,"" lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist at Harvard, told CBS News.\n\nThe findings showed that breast cancer risk was 12 to 19 percent lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in their youth, depending on how much more they ate. Eating more fiber during adolescence was linked to a 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer overall, and a 24 percent lower risk of breast cancer before menopause.\n\nFarvid said the findings show that each additional 10 grams per day increase in fiber intake during adolescence reduced the risk of breast cancer by 14 percent.\n\n""Having the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily would decrease the risk by 30 percent and potentially even greater with higher fiber intake,"" Farvid said. ""Women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later.""\n\nEating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial, the researchers said.\n\nHealthy high-fiber food choices include apples, pears, raspberries, artichokes, green peas, broccoli, split peas, lentils, beans, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice, bran flakes, and oatmeal.\n\nWhy would these foods have such an impact?\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Duke University Medical Center\'s Dr. Kimberly Blackwell said there\'s longstanding evidence that dietary fiber may cut down on circulating estrogen levels through changes in the gut microbiome.\n\nShe said that recently more evidence has come to light suggesting a relationship between dietary fiber and breast cancer risk, and that eating more fiber would be a simple way to reduce risk.\n\nOne weakness she pointed out in the study is that the women were asked to recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their 30s and 40s. Nevertheless, Blackwell said, ""It is reasonable for pediatricians to encourage a high-fiber diet and include decreasing breast cancer risk as one of the potential benefits.""\n\nDr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York, told CBS News, ""It lends support to the fact that we need to encourage people to start healthy habits earlier on.""\n\nDr. Deanna Attai, assistant clinical professor of surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles, said that while it\'s an observational study, not a clinical intervention, its larger point about diet and health is important.\n\n""The sexy headline is eat this and you\'ll have a lower risk of breast cancer, but I\'d shift the focus to, eat more fiber because it\'s better for you and you\'ll be a healthier person and you\'re less likely to be obese and have chronic inflammation and other things that will reduce your risk for heart disease and cancer along the way,"" said Attai.\n\nShe added, ""The message is a good one as far as increasing fiber, but it also has to be put in perspective. This is just one mechanism by which we can reduce risk and it does warrant further study.""']","Though it shares some shortcomings of a competing NPR story, this piece elevates itself slightly with the use of thoughtful independent sources.","This story focuses on a recent study from the journal Pediatrics, which found that women who ate more dietary fiber during adolescence and young adulthood had a lower risk of developing breast cancer. The story does a nice job of addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the study — as does a competing story we reviewed from NPR. However, as with the NPR story, this story would have been even better if it had explained that the 16% lower risk of cancer was a relative risk reduction, and that the absolute difference was a mere 0.2 percentage point. Moreover, the story would have been improved by the use of more appropriate language in the headline — this type of study can’t tell us whether fiber “may help cut breast cancer risk,” and the story should’ve reflected that uncertainty in its headline description.

Rayman, a professor of nutritional medicine at the University of Surrey in Guildford, England. But an association is only that; it doesn\'t mean one thing causes another.\n\n""So we looked for whether selenium actually causes cholesterol to rise, and we definitively found that there wasn\'t an adverse effect,"" Rayman said. ""In fact, we can safely and confidently say that, if anything, selenium had a slightly beneficial effect.""\n\nHowever, the safety of selenium has not been studied, and the authors said the findings weren\'t significant enough to recommend supplementation of the trace mineral. They also noted that the results can\'t necessarily be applied to Americans, because of differences in the food supply and diets of each country.\n\nFor the study, published in the May 17 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, the authors focused on about 500 healthy British men and women aged 60 to 74 between 2000 and 2001.\n\nBlood tests determined blood selenium, good cholesterol and bad cholesterol levels at the start of the study. For six months, some participants were assigned to take daily selenium yeast supplements in either low, intermediate or high doses, while others were given a dummy pill for the duration.\n\nNoting that blood selenium levels were relatively low across the board at the study\'s launch, the authors found that selenium levels did rise as a result of supplementation, while those taking selenium also experienced a slight drop in both bad cholesterol (LDL) and overall cholesterol levels. Good cholesterol (HDL) levels rose a bit solely among those assigned to the highest selenium dosage. None of the patients experienced any serious side effects as a result of selenium supplementation.\n\nRayman and her associates concluded that selenium supplementation does not appear to have a negative impact on blood cholesterol levels overall, and may in fact be ""modestly beneficial."" High cholesterol levels can increase the risk of heart attack.\n\nHowever, she cautioned that in general such supplementation has a minor impact and is not advisable as an effective means to combat high cholesterol, particularly for people who already have high blood selenium levels.\n\nShe added that the team\'s observations were based exclusively on an analysis of British residents, and that the findings may not necessarily apply in North America.\n\n""In the U.K., people\'s baseline selenium levels in the blood are considerably lower than they are in the U.S.,"" she noted. ""There are various reasons for that, including the fact that in the U.S. you have a wheat belt that means there is quite a high amount of selenium in the bread staple, which is not the case in the U.K.""\n\n""So, we can\'t extrapolate our findings to the U.S.,"" Rayman said. ""And so I would caution against anybody in the U.S. increasing their selenium intake based on what we found, because we also know there\'s an increased risk for type 2 diabetes when you increase selenium intake if you are already at a high level of blood selenium levels.""\n\nDr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that efforts to gauge the potential health impact of selenium have not yet demonstrated any clear benefit attributable to the trace mineral.\n\n""Overall, the evidence is inadequate to establish a protective role of selenium in cardiovascular disease or to recommend selenium supplementation to improve cardiovascular health,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nThere\'s more on selenium at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""> Overall, a good job.  Just not quite as complete as a competing <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3940"" target=""_blank"">Reuters story</a> on the same study. </span>","This story about selenium’s effects on cholesterol points out some key limitations in a new study.

When consumed by women before and during early pregnancy, this B vitamin plays a critical role in preventing severe brain and spinal cord defects. Thanks to mandatory fortification, the number of babies born in the U.S. with neural tube defects has dropped by roughly 35 percent — or about 1,300 babies a year — since the 1990s.\n\n""The story of folic acid is one of the great public health stories of — ever,"" says Dr. R.J. Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nBut there\'s one notable exception to this success story — Hispanic women — and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas.\n\nUnder current FDA rules, tortillas, corn chips and other foods made with corn masa flour can\'t be fortified with folic acid. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid.\n\nAccording to the March of Dimes, about 3,000 pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by neural tube defects each year. The rates are highest among Hispanics: Latina women are roughly 20 percent more likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect compared to non-Latina white women.\n\nThe exact cause of this discrepancy isn\'t known. Researchers say there may be genetic factors that predispose the children of some Hispanic women to neural tube defects. But they suspect diet is also a factor: ""Part of the reason was that these groups just weren\'t consuming the same level of wheat flour products. Instead, they were consuming corn masa flour products, because that was the staple grain in that diet,"" says Cynthia Pellegrini, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the March of Dimes.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Verónica Zaragovia for NPR Verónica Zaragovia for NPR\n\nResearch has shown that women who consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily have a significantly reduced risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects — including spina bifida, which can involve paralysis, and anencephaly, in which large parts of the brain are missing. The catch: Folic acid is only protective if consumed in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.\n\n""Most women, by the time they know they\'re pregnant, they\'ve already passed that critical window,"" says Dean Appling, a biochemistry professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ""If they had a problem with folic acid, it would be too late at that point to prevent the birth defect.""\n\nMandating fortification helps ensure that women are getting enough folic acid even before they know they need it. And studies suggest that fortifying corn masa with folic acid could prevent an additional 40 to 120 cases of neural tube defects among babies born to Hispanic mothers each year.\n\nSo why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? It all has to do with nixtamalization, the process by which tough corn kernels are softened by soaking in an alkaline solution, usually of slaked lime. The process, which hails from ancient Mesoamerica — what\'s now Mexico and Central America — dates back thousands of years. It renders the corn more pliable for grinding into masa flour and gives the masa its distinctive aroma and flavor.\n\nBut the FDA worries that this alkaline treatment could also ""affect the stability of added folic acid,"" the agency told The Salt in a statement. ""The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety.""\n\nThe March of Dimes and others first petitioned the FDA to allow added folic acid in corn flour masa in 2012. As part of its review, the FDA asked the petitioning groups to study whether folic acid would stay stable in corn masa flour.\n\nThe petitioners filed the results of that study in October. Michael Dunn, the Brigham Young University food scientist who led the study, cannot comment on the test results while they\'re under FDA review, but he has previously called them encouraging. As The Seattle Times has reported, Dunn\'s early results suggested no loss of folic acid in fortified masa after three months of storage.\n\nThe March of Dimes\' Pellegrini says she believes the FDA will respond to the results of Dunn\'s study later this month. But the FDA might have more questions related to the study before making a final ruling.']",This story gives readers most of what they need to know about a proposal to fortify corn flour with folic acid as a means of preventing birth defects.,"In this story, the FDA is weighing a request to add folic acid to corn flour in order to possibly prevent neural tube defects during pregnancy. Hispanic women are at higher risk of giving birth to babies with these issues. Corn flour is often consumed more than white or wheat flours in some diets. Folic acid is already added to white and wheat flours. The story does a good job of explaining the logic of adding folic acid to corn flour and what benefits it might yield. A bit more attention to the costs of such a program and the alternatives to it (e.g. vitamin pills) would have been welcome.

The study discovered the specific triggers activating the development of fibrosis which accelerates heart failure. Blocking the triggers through the use of a specific kind of bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n""This is something that nobody has ever seen before,"" says Marek Michalak, co-principal investigator and a distinguished professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta\'s Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. ""Cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart. Inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death. The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable.""\n\n""It offers hope to those who are living with heart failure,"" adds Luis Agellon, co-principal investigator and a professor at McGill University\'s School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition. ""Prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to function, even if at a reduced capacity. Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals.""\n\nFibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation there are currently 1.3 million Canadians living with heart disease or heart failure--a condition that severely limits physical activity because the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood that the body needs. About 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure will die within the first year.\n\nCardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar--all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk.\n\n""It\'s almost like building a scar,"" says Michalak. ""It\'s exactly the same type of biological activity but it\'s happening in the heart tissue. It destroys the ability of the heart to function normally.""\n\nThe team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans. They also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring.\n\n""We don\'t yet have a full understanding--nobody does--of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells,"" explains Michalak. ""So, another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level. How can this bile acid affect the heart in such a dramatic way?""\n\nOnce that occurs, the team hopes to work with cardiologists to quickly move the research into clinical trials, involving chemotherapy and heart transplant patients.\n\n""If cardiac fibrosis can be stopped, then that could substantially improve the outcome for people at risk,"" says Agellon. ""This would be a significant advance in the fight against heart disease.""\n\n###\n\nThis research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\n\n""Inhibition of the Unfolded Protein Response Mechanism Prevents Cardiac Fibrosis,"" PLOS ONE, published online July 21, 2016.']","The release over-reaches in its description of benefits — at least to humans. Transgenic mice, however, found some benefit.","This release falls short in providing the reader with useful takeaway information about an important and interesting study published in PLOS ONE. The study involved  the use of bile acids to prevent cardiac fibrosis in mice. The use of hyperbole, beginning with the title, the lack of adequate information about the study design, limitations and results, along with a suggestion that the treatment is even close to use in humans, is unfortunate.
The study is important in that it adds to the existing knowledge about fibrosis in the heart and possible ways to prevent its occurrence. The release does little to demonstrate that fact in transparent ways.

Intrarosa is the first FDA approved product containing the active ingredient prasterone, which is also known as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).\n\nDuring menopause, levels of estrogen decline in vaginal tissues, which may cause a condition known as VVA, leading to symptoms such as pain during sexual intercourse.\n\n""Pain during sexual intercourse is one of the most frequent symptoms of VVA reported by postmenopausal women,"" said Audrey Gassman, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products (DBRUP) in the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). ""Intrarosa provides an additional treatment option for women seeking relief of dyspareunia caused by VVA.""\n\nEfficacy of Intrarosa, a once-daily vaginal insert, was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trials of 406 healthy postmenopausal women, 40 to 80 years of age, who identified moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse as their most bothersome symptom of VVA. Women were randomly assigned to receive Intrarosa or a placebo vaginal insert. Intrarosa, when compared to placebo, was shown to reduce the severity of pain experienced during sexual intercourse.\n\nThe safety of Intrarosa was established in four 12-week placebo-controlled trials and one 52-week open-label trial. The most common adverse reactions were vaginal discharge and abnormal Pap smear.\n\nAlthough DHEA is included in some dietary supplements, the efficacy and safety of those products have not been established for diagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating or preventing any disease.\n\nIntrarosa is marketed by Quebec-based Endoceutics Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###\n\nInquiries Media: Andrea Fischer 301-796-0393 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA\n\nRelated Information']",The research on the trial of a drug for alleviating pain in postmenopausal women during sex was conducted and written by the manufacturer. That’s not mentioned in the release.,"The US Food and Drug Administration just approved Intrarosa, a once-daily vaginal insert used to treat women experiencing pain during sexual intercourse. The news release states that the drug’s efficacy was confirmed in two 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trials of around 400 postmenopausal women. “Intrarosa, when compared to placebo, was shown to reduce the severity of pain experienced during sexual intercourse,” it says.
That was about the extent of the discussion in addressing benefits and quality of evidence, as there are no quantitative data given, and no mention of the study’s design and limitations. With such lack of detail, we also don’t know how concerned we should be with the drug’s adverse effects, which could include “abnormal” pap smears.
If the news release refers to studies that the FDA used to evaluate the drug’s efficacy, it would be helpful if the FDA included the journal name and date of publication of the trials that informed the approval. And then the news release should clearly break down the results of those studies — complete with quantitative data — for journalists and the public.

742,story_reviews_01405,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3162/,2010-09-19 04:00:00,New Drugs Stir Debate on Rules of Clinical Trials,"[""Even if it became clear that the chemotherapy could not hold back the tumors advancing into his lungs, liver and, most painfully, his spine, he would not be allowed to switch, lest it muddy the trial’s results.\n\n“I’m very sorry,” Dr. Bartosz Chmielowski, the U.C.L.A. oncologist treating both cousins, told Mr. Ryan’s mother, Jan. He sounded so miserable that afternoon that Mrs. Ryan, distraught, remembers pausing to feel sorry for the doctor.\n\nControlled trials have for decades been considered essential for proving a drug’s value before it can go to market. But the continuing trial of the melanoma drug, PLX4032, has ignited an anguished debate among oncologists about whether a controlled trial that measures a drug’s impact on extending life is still the best method for evaluating hundreds of genetically targeted cancer drugs being developed.\n\nDefenders of controlled trials say they are crucial in determining whether a drug really does extend life more than competing treatments. Without the hard proof the trials can provide, doctors are left to prescribe unsubstantiated hope — and an overstretched health care system is left to pay for it. In melanoma, in particular, no drug that looked promising in early trials had ever turned out to prolong lives.\n\nPLX4032 shrinks tumors in the right patients, for a limited time. But would those who took it live longer? No one knew for sure.\n\n“I think we have to prove it,” said Dr. Paul B. Chapman, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who is leading the trial. “I think we have to show that we’re actually helping people in the long run.”\n\nBut critics of the trials argue that the new science behind the drugs has eclipsed the old rules — and ethics — of testing them. They say that in some cases, drugs under development, PLX4032 among them, may be so much more effective than their predecessors that putting half the potential beneficiaries into a control group, and delaying access to the drug to thousands of other patients, causes needless suffering.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“With chemotherapy, you’re subjecting patients to a toxic treatment, and the response rates are much lower, so it’s important to answer ‘Are you really helping the patient?’ ” said Dr. Charles L. Sawyers, chairman of human oncology at Sloan-Kettering. “But with these drugs that have minimal side effects and dramatic response rates, where we understand the biology, I wonder, why do we have to be so rigorous? This could be one of those defining cases that says, ‘Look, our system has to change.’ ”\n\nDr. Richard Pazdur, director of the cancer drug office at the Food and Drug Administration, said in a recent interview that the new wave of drugs in development — especially for intractable cancers like melanoma — might require individual evaluation. “This is an unprecedented situation that will, hopefully, be increasingly common, and it may require a regulatory flexibility and an open public discussion,” he said.\n\nAnd doctors say that for them, the new wave of cancer drugs is intensifying the conflict between their responsibility to their patients and their commitment to gathering scientific knowledge for generations of the critically ill.\n\nOf course, no single pair of patients can fairly represent the outcomes of a trial whose results are not yet known. Rather, the story of Thomas McLaughlin and Brandon Ryan is one of entwined paths that suddenly diverged, with a roll of the dice.\n\nAt times beseeching and belligerent, Mr. McLaughlin argued his cousin’s case to get the new drug with anyone he could find at U.C.L.A. “Hey, put him on it, he needs it,” he pleaded. And then: “Who the hell is making these decisions?”\n\nPhoto\n\nHe believed he should trade places on the trial with Mr. Ryan, who was pursuing his contractor’s license and had just bought a four-bedroom home in Bakersfield. “Brandon has everything going for him,” he told his Aunt Jan.\n\nBut Mr. Ryan told his mother he was glad that Mr. McLaughlin, who has a young son and daughter, was the one getting the promising drug. “Tommy has the kids,” he said. “They need him around.”\n\nPath to a Second Trial\n\nThe debate over the controlled testing of PLX4032 began in June 2009, around the time Mr. McLaughlin awakened with what felt like an explosion under his right armpit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe drug, manufactured by Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, was designed for melanoma patients whose tumors carry a particular mutation, and the company reported that month that nearly all 32 such patients in the drug’s first clinical trial, called Phase 1, had seen their tumors shrink.\n\nThe reprieve was all too brief: most saw their tumors begin to grow again within the year. Still, The New England Journal of Medicine called the drug “a major breakthrough” for people with advanced melanoma, whose median survival is eight months after diagnosis. A second, or Phase 2, trial, aiming to validate the results in more patients, was already in the works. And in meetings that summer, several oncologists urged Roche to seek accelerated approval from the F.D.A. The agency allows a manufacturer to sell a drug based on early promise so long as it proceeds with the traditional controlled trial comparing it with the standard treatment.\n\nBut with patients already begging doctors for the drug, it seemed unlikely that anyone would join a trial with only a 50-50 chance of getting PLX4032 once it was already on the market. Unless the trial was conducted before approval, it seemed, there would be no chance to get definitive data on its effectiveness.\n\nSome melanoma specialists familiar with the drug would have traded the data for faster access to the drug. “I know all that I need to know based on the results we already have,” said Dr. Keith Flaherty of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the early clinical testing. “My use of this drug is not going to be informed by testing it against a drug we all hate and would rather never give a dose of again in our lives.”\n\nThe standard chemotherapy used in melanoma, dacarbazine, slowed tumor growth in 15 percent of patients for an average of two months. By contrast, PLX4032 had halted tumor growth in 81 percent of patients for an average of eight.\n\nIt was conceivable that when the cancer started up again, it would progress much faster in patients who had taken the new drug, wiping out any extra time they might have gained. But even if so, many doctors believed that if the drug provided relief by shrinking tumors — like the one Mr. McLaughlin soon learned was pressing against a nerve in his arm — that would improve their patients’ lives.\n\nThe trial, moreover, would cost $100 million and delay the possibility of F.D.A. approval by at least two years. To some doctors, it seemed a waste of time and resources that would be better used for trials testing what everyone most cared about: how to prolong the remissions.\n\nThere was reason to believe that combining PLX4032 with other drugs — some from competitors — would make it more effective. But researchers had to rely on Roche for permission until the drug was available for sale, and the company had not been forthcoming.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Chapman of Sloan-Kettering came up with a new tack: an unconventional bid to speed the drug’s approval, rooted in the observation that patients weeks or days from death could get out of bed and off oxygen when given PLX4032, sometimes for months. The doctors working with the drug referred to this as the Lazarus effect; it was unheard of with dacarbazine.\n\nA trial that cataloged PLX4032’s effect on the well-being of the sickest patients, Dr. Chapman argued, would probably yield fast, tangible results. For him, it represented a chance to give patients symptomatic relief, even if the drug turned out not to prolong life.\n\n“Even without a survival benefit, maybe we could show that it helps people,” he urged. “If you could get Aunt Sadie to the wedding and off of oxygen, that would be great.”\n\nBut company officials feared that might lead to approval for only a narrow group of the sickest patients. The surest way to get the F.D.A’s endorsement for a broader market was a controlled trial. And with its competitors rushing to get similar drugs to market, the findings of such a trial might give Roche an advantage in marketing its version as the only one proven to prolong survival.\n\nOn Sept. 1 last year, the company submitted its plan to the F.D.A. for the traditional, randomized, controlled trial of PLX4032. It would involve 680 patients, half of them in a control group. Dr. Chapman would be the lead investigator for more than 100 sites in the United States, Europe and Australia. Because of the different ways the drugs were dispensed — one by mouth and one by infusions — doctors and patients, it was decided, would both know who got which drug.\n\nThe following week was when Mr. Ryan learned that his cousin might have a health problem. He called Mr. McLaughlin from a job site in Colorado, to tell him about his new Dodge Ram, a truck he knew Mr. McLaughlin had long coveted.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe invited Mr. McLaughlin to come stay with him: there was plenty of welding work, and he could help break in the truck. But Mr. McLaughlin, who had no health insurance, had finally visited a doctor about the pain under his arm. It was melanoma, and he would need surgery to remove some lymph nodes.\n\n“Wow,” Mr. Ryan said, suddenly silent. “You have cancer?”\n\nTwo Men’s Struggles\n\nMr. McLaughlin’s surgery, it seemed, had come too late. In the weeks following, small tumors popped up across his body, including one on his collarbone and one on his triceps.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Mr. Ryan discovered a swollen node under his own right armpit in October, his mother was not taking any chances. She begged him to go to the emergency room in Colorado. Even so, when the verdict was melanoma, both families were shocked.\n\nWas it genes? Their mothers, after all, were sisters. But there was no history of cancer in the family.\n\nEnvironment? The boys had fought, played and competed with each other since childhood: who could hold his breath the longest, do the highest cannonball dive, suck down a Slurpee fastest, win their grandfather’s approval? They had ranged across California on iron-working jobs, eating the same food, drinking the same large quantities of beer, promising, in a rare moment of seriousness, that each would bury the other with his hardhat when the moment came. Coincidence?\n\nCompared with most cancers, melanoma strikes a disproportionate number of young people; it is the sixth most common cancer in the United States.\n\nThere was no way to know.\n\nLast Thanksgiving, Mr. McLaughlin greeted Mr. Ryan with the usual bear hug. “Looks like we’re doing this together,” he said.\n\nNot ones for excessively talking things over, they left it at that.\n\nYet both cousins, like the other family members, believed then that Mr. Ryan stood a far better chance of surviving the disease than his cousin. His cancer was rated Stage 3, with no evidence yet that it had spread to distant parts of his body. Mr. McLaughlin, at Stage 4, had a tumor ominously near his liver. And Mr. Ryan had health insurance, while Mr. McLaughlin had none.\n\nIt was the mutated gene that the U.C.L.A doctor found in Mr. McLaughlin’s cancer cells in December that turned his luck around. Called B-RAF, it goes awry in half of the 68,000 Americans who develop melanoma each year, for reasons not well understood, signaling cells to grow uncontrollably.\n\nThe mutation meant that he would be eligible for PLX4032’s new trial, so the cost of the drug and doctors’ visits would be paid by Roche. And it turned out he would get the pills even before the controlled study began, on a small test of the drug’s interaction with common drugs like caffeine and cough syrup. Judging by the response of patients to PLX4032 in the first trial, Mr. McLaughlin was almost certain to respond. But the medication, the doctors at U.C.L.A warned him, might cause a rash and fatigue and would probably make his skin extremely sensitive to the sun.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“They told me to get a job where I could be inside all the time,” Mr. McLaughlin told Mr. Ryan with a grin; perhaps no one else could better understand how ridiculous it seemed for someone who had spent his whole life outdoors.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But because he had few symptoms, it hardly seemed to matter. After surgery to remove his cancerous lymph nodes and radiation, he was preparing to return to work.\n\n“Dude, I had ALL of my lymph nodes out,” Mr. Ryan boasted to his cousin over a Mexican-style Christmas dinner at their grandmother’s home in Santa Maria, not passing up an opportunity at one-upmanship. “How many did you have out again, 11?”\n\nMr. McLaughlin, fingering the tumor that felt like a knot under his arm, might not have been in top form that evening. But he mustered a scoffing reply: “So you had all of them taken out and only four had tumors?”\n\nThe following week, he took his first pills.\n\nBut even as the tumor on Mr. McLaughlin’s collarbone began to melt away, a faint spot on Mr. Ryan’s lung began to grow.\n\nA Life-or-Death Debate\n\nThe discontent among some oncologists over the design of the PLX4032 trial spilled over at a scientific meeting sponsored by the Melanoma Research Alliance in late February.\n\nThe ethical review boards at dozens of prestigious cancer research institutions had signed off on the trial, and the leading melanoma oncologists had embraced it: after all, it was the only way to get the most promising drug available for their patients.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut with the trial now under way, a few attending the Las Vegas meeting had already had to tell patients they had been assigned to the trial’s chemotherapy control group. And some had begun to question whether an ethical code that calls for doctors to be genuinely uncertain about which of a trial’s treatments will be more effective had been breached when it came to PLX4032 versus dacarbazine.\n\nAfter Dr. Chapman presented the recent data from the drug’s promising first trial to a packed room, Dr. Neal Rosen, a friend and Sloan-Kettering colleague, stood up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Excuse me,” Dr. Rosen said with unusual formality. “But if it was your life on the line, Doctor, would you take dacarbazine?”\n\nThe room was silent.\n\n“My goal,” Dr. Chapman shot back, “is to find out as quickly as possible in as few patients as possible whether this works. If we never know, then we’re never going to be able to build on anything.”\n\nOne of the melanoma field’s senior clinicians, Dr. Chapman had lived through trial after trial of drugs that failed to live up to early promise. Almost every oncologist knew, too, of a case nearly 20 years earlier when bone marrow transplants appeared so effective that breast cancer patients demanded their immediate approval, only to learn through a controlled trial that the transplants were less effective than chemotherapy and in some cases caused death.\n\n“Making patients’ tumors go away is gratifying,” Dr. Chapman told critics. “But that’s not the business I’m in. I’m in the business of making people live longer. That’s what I want to do.”\n\nSeveral of the most veteran melanoma doctors agreed with him. But others argued that oncologists had an ethical obligation to push both the F.D.A. and Roche to make the drug more immediately available.\n\nSome of the strongest criticism came from laboratory researchers who study the biology of the disease and see the drug as fundamentally different from its predecessors. The previous red herrings, they argued, never had such a high response rate. Few other drugs had shrunk tumors in as high a percentage of patients with melanoma or any other solid tumor as PLX4032 had in its first human trial.\n\n“Many of my colleagues who are outstanding clinical investigators have been able to convince themselves that this is a fair thing to do,” Dr. David E. Fisher, a leading melanoma biologist at Massachusetts General, said of the controlled trial. “My personal view is it’s nuts. I don’t know anyone who hasn’t shuddered at the concept that we can’t let patients on the control arm cross over because we need them to die earlier to prove this point.”\n\nIn the meantime, some doctors were searching for other trials that could help patients worsening in the chemotherapy group of the Roche trial, even at the risk of undermining its results. Several lobbied to get such patients slots on a new trial of a PLX4032 competitor, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“It’s much easier to tell patients, ‘We’ll try this for six weeks; if it’s working, great, if not, we’ll shift you right away to the other trial,” said Dr. Jeffrey A. Sosman of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville. “That’s how I’m going to be able to live with the randomization.”\n\nThe reason to prevent patients in the chemotherapy group from subsequently getting PLX4032 was to ensure a clean comparison. But who could prevent them from trying treatments that might well help them live longer? At least one melanoma patient left Sloan-Kettering’s care to join the Glaxo trial at New York University.\n\nIn April, Mr. McLaughlin donned a bandanna, a sun hat, a long-sleeved shirt and pants and went to a job building fences on a nearby ranch. The pills, he had vowed, would not prevent him from working outside.\n\nMr. Ryan’s health, by contrast, was declining. He returned from work only to sleep. Often, when his mother called, he was too tired to come to the phone. “Sleeping, Mom,” he would text her. Or “You have no idea what this feels like, Mom.” Or just, “I hurt.”\n\nHis doctor in Bakersfield moved up a scheduled scan.\n\nAt the same time, a debate grew heated over Roche’s decision to withhold PLX4032 from many patients not eligible for the trial because they had already been treated with chemotherapy.\n\nThe F.D.A. regularly approves such programs, known as “compassionate use,” for promising experimental drugs. But Roche feared a prospective trial candidate might undergo chemotherapy just to qualify for compassionate use and get PLX4032 with no strings attached.\n\nIn an emotional moment, Dr. Donald Lawrence of Massachusetts General Hospital e-mailed colleagues about Roche’s decision last spring, under the subject line “moral outrage.”\n\nPhoto\n\n“Just had yet another conversation with a [patient] with a B-RAF mutation who will die in the next month or so because he can’t get PLX4032,” he wrote. “I feel we need to muster the support of our patients and lobby both Roche and the F.D.A. Compromising the Phase III trial is not justification for withholding an effective drug from dying patients.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Dr. Michael Atkins, director of the cancer clinical trials office at Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center in Boston, urged him to consider what he thought was the greater good: “Even though it is painful, I think completing a clean Phase III trial and determining if there truly is a survival benefit for PLX would have major value for the field and future patients.”\n\nA Bitter Blow\n\nOn the morning of May 12, Mr. Ryan and his mother drove to U.C.L.A. The cancer had spread throughout his body. Yet that weekend, the family was filled with hope. Dr. Chmielowski had found the same gene mutation that Mr. McLaughlin had in one of Mr. Ryan’s tumors. He was finally eligible for the trial.\n\nBut the computer made its assignment the following Tuesday, making sure that he would not be getting his cousin’s “superpills.”\n\nMr. Ryan’s mother picked up the call while her son was undergoing radiation for the tumor on his spine. He was on oxygen.\n\n“I’m sorry,” Dr. Chmielowski repeated as she cried into the phone.\n\nThere must be someone higher up to whom she could talk, she said.\n\nThere was not, he told her. It was completely random. No one could change it.\n\n“Who else has this drug?” Mrs. Ryan demanded. “We will go wherever we have to go.”\n\nThere was nowhere to go, the doctor explained. Once Mr. Ryan had been randomly assigned to the control group at one place, the other hospitals testing the melanoma drug would not give it to him.

Obeying the trial’s protocol meant withholding the drug from patients like Mr. Ryan, and that, Dr. Chmielowski would later explain, “is awful.”\n\nHe told Mrs. Ryan, if the chemotherapy could stabilize her son for just a month or so, there were two new trials opening that might help him.\n\n“What gives them the right to play God?” Mrs. Ryan exploded at home later that night. “It doesn’t make sense to say, ‘We want you for a statistic’ instead of giving them a chance at life.”\n\nMr. Ryan started his infusion the next day.

Mr. Ryan missed his mark by several feet and the bolt landed on the other side, shattering the windshield of another contractor’s truck.\n\n“I’m like, ‘You just tagged that guy’s freakin’ truck,’ ” Mr. McLaughlin recounted for the other family members in the hospital room. On his side of the wall, Mr. Ryan had picked up a stray golf ball. “And then the guy walks out and Brandon goes, ‘Looks like those golfers hit your windshield.’ ”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his hospital bed, Mr. Ryan was beginning to smile.\n\n“And the guy gets in the truck,” Mr. McLaughlin finished, “and takes off for the golf course.”\n\nTwo weeks later, at his cousin’s funeral in mid-June, Mr. McLaughlin placed Mr. Ryan’s hardhat in his coffin and helped carry it to the grave.\n\nMr. McLaughlin has now been taking PLX4032 for nine months.

Yes.  Overall impression?  Strong. ,"A powerfully written account of how two cancer patients’ lives track the development of a promising cancer drug, this story does readers a great service by explaining the intricacies and ethical quandries of the clinical trial process. It does not serve them as well, though, in presenting clearly the evidence behind the drug in question: PLX4032. The reporter talked to at least 12 sources, many more than most stories we review, and went to lengths to explain that PLX4032 has generated a lot of hopeful talk but not a lot of proof. Still, by painiting such vivid portraits of the two main characters and inviting readers to truly fall in love with them, the story encourages readers to feel in the end that the patient who dies without taking the drug — without experiencing what the story repeatedly calls ""the Lazarus effect"" — has been victimized by an unjust and antiquated scientific process.

The genetic disorder is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. The disease can lead to scarring on muscles, including the heart. As scarring on the heart worsens, it affects the organ\'s ability to function and can be fatal.\n\nIn February, Sizemore became the first patient ever to get an infusion of stem cells into his heart in the hopes of stopping or even reversing some of the scarring related to the disease.\n\nDr. John Jefferies, director of advanced heart failure and cardiomyopathy at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, is treating Sizemore. He said a person suffering from Duchenne usually lives into his or her early 30s because of scarring on the heart.\n\n""We’re going in and trying to reverse the scar tissue and potentially even mitigate the new development of scar tissue,"" Jefferies told ABC News. ""If we can preserve his cardiac function he has a fantastic outlook.""\n\nJefferies explained that the process works by allowing the stem cells to enter the heart, thus encouraging the heart to heal itself.\n\nThe stem cells ""create a healthy environment"" in the heart and help the tissue ""go from abnormal state to normal state,"" Jefferies noted.\n\nJefferies said if the medication works on patients like Sizemore, it could then be tested on millions of other Americans who have scarring on their heart due to the disease or past heart attacks.\n\n""It is very exciting especially because of the impact it has on other kids and how it paves the way so that others can get the treatment and how this will change people’s lives and extend them,"" Sizemore said.\n\nThe teenager said he also has renewed optimism for his own health.\n\n""It’s made me more hopeful,"" Sizemore said. ""Especially when I think of how amazing medical treatments and technology is and how far it’s gotten...especially since I was diagnosed 12 years ago.""\n\nSizemore will return to Cincinnati in a few months so doctors can scan his heart and see if the scar tissue has been affected by the infusion.']",This story fails to counter rosy statements by a physician and a patient with realistic assessments of the potential benefits and pitfalls of an unproven procedure for a fatal disease with no known cure.,"This is a story about one young man receiving an experimental infusion of stem cells into his heart, to help with tissue scarring due to muscular dystrophy. Despite booming research around potential stem cell treatments for a wide range of conditions, the list of diseases for which stem cell therapy has been shown to be effective remains very short, according to the International Society for Stem Cell Research. Yet media outlets often put an optimistic spin on unproven stem cell therapies, as we’ve seen in our examinations of stories on heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, and multiple sclerosis.
Showcasing a few preliminary cases with encouraging outcomes can exaggerate the potential benefits of a treatment and raise false hopes for patients. This story, based on a single case with an unknown outcome, fits this pattern. It fails to counter rosy statements by a physician and a patient with realistic assessments of the potential benefits and pitfalls of an unproven procedure for a fatal disease with no known cure. The story also lacks clinical details that would help readers get a true picture of the nature of the treatment, as well as a discussion of costs.

Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients\' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition.\n\nThe research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment, known as therapeutic hypothermia, for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth. For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael\'s Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age.\n\nThe research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs.\n\nThe study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care.\n\nBefore therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability).\n\nIn this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability). Also, the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk. Even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for, cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment.\n\nProfessor Marianne Thoresen said: ""Even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia, our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood. Cooling treatment also reduces the number and severity of cerebral palsy and increases the number of patients who survive normally.""\n\n###\n\nThe research was funded by Sparks UK; University of Bristol\'s Alumni Foundation; The Laerdal Foundation for Acute Medicine, Norway; University of Oslo, and a private donation.\n\nPaper:\n\n\'Reduced infancy and childhood epilepsy following hypothermia-treated neonatal encephalopathy\' by Xun Liu, Sally Jary, Frances Cowan and Marianne Thoresen in Epilepsia']",Therapeutic hypothermia for newborns deprived of oxygen at birth is a new but fairly well adopted practice. We’re not sure how this observational study sets this research apart.,"The news release focuses on a recent journal article that describes findings from a long-term study about the effects of “therapeutic hypothermia” on newborn infants who have been deprived of oxygen at birth. Specifically, the release focuses on the finding that lowering the body temperature of infants after perinatal asphyxia reduces the rate — and severity — of epilepsy in those patients as they get older. The release does not, however, do much to place the work in context. There is a great deal of research available in this area, and the release would have been much stronger if it had made more clear what sets this work apart.

That means that if women do take hormones, Bachmann told Reuters Health, it should be the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period of time.\n\nAnd not every woman needs treatment, notes Bachmann, who was not involved in the study. Women with severe or frequent hot flashes or whose hot flashes keep them up at night, should consider treatment, she said.\n\nWomen typically suffer between 30 and 150 hot flashes a month, said Dr. Rafael Bolanos-Diaz, professor of health economics at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru, who co-authored the study.\n\nWomen who took hormones had an average of 24 fewer hot flashes per month, while those who took soy had 12 per month fewer. The study did not look at whether eating soy in food has the same effect on hot flashes as supplements, Bolanos-Diaz said.\n\nThe researchers looked at 19 studies on how a treatment, either hormones or soy, compared to a placebo. They compared the average number of hot flashes in 760 women who had treatment with 770 who did not.\n\nThe study was published in Menopause: The Journal of the North American Menopause Society.\n\nSoy hasn’t been studied as much as hormone replacement to treat hot flashes, and doctors don’t know exactly how it works. It’s thought to have similar effects to estrogen on the brain, bones, and blood vessels, Bolanos-Diaz told Reuters Health by email.\n\nSoy supplements also have side effects: Nausea, bloating, and constipation, according to the NIH. A month’s supply costs about $12, while a month of hormone tablets runs between $40 and $60.\n\n“For some women, hormone therapy is the best option, for some soy is best, and for some, it’s just watchful waiting until the hot flashes subside,” Bachmann said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/hBua85 Menopause: The Journal of The North American Menopause Society, online March 3, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was a solid summary, delivered in only 423 words, and addressing our criteria in almost all cases. </span>","One of the only suggestions we would make is that the story could have quantified potential harms.  It didn’t quantify harms of estrogen (about which there is a great deal of evidence) nor of soy (for which there is a scant evidence base).

The study summarized in this release relied on questionnaires about pain and quality of life in 901 people over age 65 who have used medical marijuana for 6 months for a variety of conditions (about two-thirds for either nonspecific or cancer-related pain).
The news release uses unjustified language and relative numbers to suggest the study shows that medical marijuana is “safe and efficacious” for a variety of conditions which afflict the elderly. But it doesn’t point out major limitations and significant conflicts of interest to the reader. Furthermore, the misleading headline implies that marijuana is safer and more effective than opioids (even though this was not part of the study).  Finally, the last paragraph provocatively hints that marijuana might help reduce opioid dependence.

He is vice president for health care outcomes and policy at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y. Edge was co-chair of the panel that developed the new guidelines.\n\nOne radiation treatment expert welcomed the updated recommendations.\n\n""The guideline is timely,"" said Dr. Janna Andrews, an attending physician in radiation medicine at Norwell Health Cancer Institute, in Lake Success, N.Y. ""The field of post-mastectomy radiation is changing. It\'s always up for discussion now as to who needs [post-mastectomy radiation therapy].""\n\nThe new guidelines help clarify what used to be a gray area, Andrews explained. ""In the past, if a woman had a small tumor, less than 5 centimeters, and not more than three or four positive lymph nodes, many doctors would say she does not need [post-mastectomy radiation therapy],"" she said.\n\nThe guidelines don\'t offer a single formula for which patients need radiation therapy, Edge noted. But they do focus on the group of women for whom there is the most debate about the value of radiation.\n\n""There is a great deal of controversy about whether women with one, two or three lymph nodes [with cancer] have sufficient risk to warrant radiation,"" he said. ""For women with four or more lymph nodes involved, everyone would recommend radiation.""\n\nThe guidelines also strongly support input from all specialists who treat breast cancer in making the decision about radiation treatment. That typically includes the surgeon, radiation physician and an oncologist.\n\nDoctors need to weigh the risks and benefits, Edge added. Side effects can include redness of the skin, swelling and skin breakdown severe enough to compromise future breast reconstruction, he explained.\n\nEdge said that doctors need to consider patients individually. For instance, he explained, \'\'a woman 65 who has microscopic involvement in a single lymph node and an estrogen-receptor positive cancer would be very different from a 38-year-old who has three lymph nodes involved and so-called triple-negative breast cancer."" The younger woman, he said, would typically be advised to get radiation.\n\nThe older woman, because her risk is lower, should have a discussion with her doctor to decide if the benefit outweighs the risk, Edge noted.\n\nAndrews said that one take-home message for patients is to expect the surgeon to have consulted with the radiation oncologist and others on her team. If a woman\'s doctor tells her she does not need radiation after a mastectomy, the woman should be told why and she should ask if the radiation oncologist weighed in on the decision.\n\nEdge was a panel representative from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which created the guidelines along with the American Society for Radiation Oncology and the Society of Surgical Oncology.\n\nAll three groups published the guidelines online this week in their respective journals: the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Practical Radiation Oncology and the Annals of Surgical Oncology.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about radiation in breast cancer treatment, visit BreastCancer.org.']","The story also needed a discussion around costs of radiation therapy, which can be pricey.","National Cancer Institute
The story addresses new guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society for Radiation Oncology and the Society of Surgical Oncology, which say that that some breast cancer patients who would have been unlikely to receive radiation therapy in the past may benefit from radiation treatment. Specifically, the guidance (and the story) focuses on cases in which the patient has had a mastectomy, had small tumors, and in which few lymph nodes are involved.
To fully appreciate these new guidelines, patients and healthcare providers need some basic information that they can use to evaluate the costs and benefits of radiation therapy: How much does it reduce risk of cancer recurrence? How much would it cost? How strong is the evidence behind these guidelines? To varying degrees, the story falls short on these fronts.

Source: Marilyn Ritholz, a senior psychologist at Joslin Diabetes Center TYPE 1 DIABETES AFFECTS EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE TYPE 1 DIABETES AFFECTS EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE Type 1 diabetes is not one of those medical conditions for which you can just pop a pill and then forget about it. It forces you to think about every bite you put in your mouth, every activity you do, says Andrew Drexler, director of the Gonda Diabetes Center at UCLA. ""It\'s always there. You can never get away from it."" There are almost 24 million estimated cases of diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. Almost 10% of diagnosed cases are type 1. Experts believe the disease involves an autoimmune process that destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone needed to convert sugar, starches and other food into energy. ""We know there\'s a genetic component, but not everybody with that genetic component gets type 1,"" Drexler says. Type 1 is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. The most serious short-term problem is hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, which can cause wooziness and disorientation. If it strikes while someone\'s driving, for instance, he\'s at risk for an accident. If blood sugar dips severely low, coma and death can occur. Untreated hyperglycemia, when blood sugar runs too high, can lead to long-term problems over the years, including kidney disease, blindness and limb amputation. A diagnosis can have a significant effect on mental health, says Duke endocrinologist Susan Spratt. ""Patients go through the stages of grief,"" Spratt says. ""They mourn the life they had before diabetes, a life when they could eat, exercise and sleep spontaneously,"" Spratt says. The key to managing the disease: Check blood sugar often and use insulin and other medicines to keep blood sugars steady, Drexler says. Are we close to finding a cure? ""We likely won\'t see any major breakthroughs soon, in the next 10 years,"" Drexler says. But Spratt says patients should remain positive. ""We have to give our patients hope that the medical community is working on a cure. Type 1 diabetes is treatable. You can live a full life and grow up, have a family and be anything you want to be."" --By Mary Brophy Marcus, USA TODAY ORLANDO \x97 Scientists are getting closer to offering an ""artificial pancreas"" to children and adults with type 1 diabetes that will help better control the swings of blood glucose that come with the disease. Researchers working on artificial pancreas technology announced at this weekend\'s 70th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association that the latest tests of the technology show it can be used in real-life scenarios with success, including after eating a large meal and drinking a glass of white wine. ""The rubber is finally starting to hit the road. We\'re seeing more and more studies telling us it can be done and it can be done safely,"" says Aaron Kowalski, research director of the Artificial Pancreas Project for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Kowalski says they believe the technology could be available within the next few years. Artificial pancreas technology has three components: •A continuous glucose monitor, attached by a slender wire to the body, that measures blood glucose levels and the direction they are trending through the day, as opposed to pricking the finger and using test strips to get a single, snapshot blood sugar reading. •An insulin pump, also attached to the body, that doses insulin continuously at a low level and can be adjusted. •A sophisticated computer program that can help the two devices ""talk"" to each other and automate the process. The first two technologies are already available. Researchers with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation have been testing the multi-component system in a range of in-clinic situations. Earlier this year, in a study in TheLancet, they showed that the artificial pancreas technology could better control blood glucose levels during sleep and reduce the chance of hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar, in children with type 1. In this weekend\'s presentation, researchers reported that the benefits remained when the system was tested in 12 adults, ages 18 to 65, who ate a large meal and drank a glass of white wine before bedtime. ""It was quite a large meal — a meal like you\'d eat out at a restaurant with a glass of wine. It included over 100 grams of carbohydrates,"" says lead researcher Roman Hovorka, principal research associate at the University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories. In the study, 70% of the time, participants were within their target blood glucose range, up from 47% when they didn\'t use the technology. Even with this technology, you\'re still working backward, says endocrinologist Robert Rizza, executive dean of research at the Mayo Clinic. ""It takes time for that insulin to be absorbed. Despite that fact, it\'s been working very well and helps avoid very high and very low blood sugars."" Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Not only is there no mention that the makers of the drug paid for the trials and hired writers to produce the article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, the lone independent expert quoted actually receives consulting and speaking fees from one of the drug makers.
Also, the story mentions three patients, but not one who had less than spectacular results. Including one of the many patients who did not see their eczema and itching completely disappear would have provided a more balanced view of the trial results.

The best thing about your coffee habit might be that it extends your life by reducing your risk of death from heart disease, diabetes or even cancer.\n\nTwo large studies published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that the more coffee a person drank, the lower his or her risk of early death. The results were largely consistent among more than 700,000 study participants from a variety of racial, ethnic and cultural backgrounds.\n\nAnd get this: The inverse relationship between coffee consumption and death held up even for people who drank decaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious research had already offered strong hints that coffee isn’t bad for you, and might actually be good for you. But those studies generally involved fewer people, most of whom were of European descent.\n\nA team from the National Cancer Institute, USC and the University of Hawaii sought to correct that by examining coffee-drinking habits in 185,855 Americans who were participating in the Multiethnic Cohort Study, which has been tracking volunteers since 1993. On average, each volunteer was followed for 16.2 years.\n\nCompared with the 16% of people who didn’t drink coffee at all, those who downed two or more cups each day were about 18% less likely to have died during the study period. In addition, those who drank just one to six cups of coffee per week were 12% less likely to die. Both of these figures were calculated after taking into account known risk factors for early death, such as smoking (which is often paired with coffee drinking), diet and body mass index.\n\nWhen the researchers examined whites, blacks, Latinos, Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians separately, they “found no indication that the associations varied by race/ethnicity,” according to their report. The link between coffee and longevity was statistically significant in all groups except for the Native Hawaiians. The researchers said this was probably because there weren’t enough of them in the study to rule out the possibility that the link was just a fluke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study authors also compared coffee drinking with each of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. (which combined to account for 81% of the 58,397 deaths that occurred during the study period). The more coffee one drank, the less likely he or she was to die of heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke, diabetes or kidney disease. Coffee apparently had no effect on the risk of dying of influenza or pneumonia, Alzheimer’s disease, accidents or suicide.\n\nUntil now, there hasn’t been much data to go on regarding coffee and health risks in people who aren’t white. Without it, researchers couldn’t say whether the inverse association observed in people of European descent would apply to people of other backgrounds as well.\n\nNow they can see that it does. Not only is this useful information to coffee drinkers, it also suggests that there’s a biological explanation for the link. (More on that later.)\n\nA second study mined data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study to see whether there was a link between coffee and early death among 521,330 people from 10 countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom). These volunteers were tracked for an average of 16.4 years.\n\nOnce again, the researchers (most of whom were from Europe) found that the top 25% of coffee drinkers in each nation were less likely to die during the study period than their countrymen who shunned coffee altogether. After accounting for smoking, diet and other factors, the authors calculated that the risk of early death was 12% lower in men and 7% lower in women.\n\nAs with the American study, the European team “found no evidence” that coffee was linked to better health only for people in certain countries.\n\nBoth studies found similar results for people who drank decaffeinated coffee as for people who drank the real thing.\n\nThough the two studies involved hundreds of thousands of people, they weren’t designed to show that drinking more coffee caused people to live longer; that would require a randomized trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there are reasons to think that compounds in coffee would reduce the risk of premature death, according to an editorial that accompanies the studies.\n\nFor instance, the polyphenols found in coffee act as antioxidants, helping cells cope with the damaging effects of molecules called free radicals. In addition, genes related to caffeine metabolism also influence things like blood pressure and cholesterol.\n\nBoth groups of researchers also noted that previous studies have linked coffee drinking to improvements in the body’s liver function, sensitivity to insulin and inflammation.\n\nThe editorial concluded that it was still “premature” to recommend coffee as a way to “reduce mortality or prevent chronic disease.” But the results should alleviate any fears that there’s something dangerous about drinking up to five cups of coffee each day, the authors added.\n\nConsidering that an estimated 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed somewhere in the world each day, that’s something to celebrate with an espresso, a latte, a cappuccino or a regular cuppa joe.\n\nkaren.kaplan@latimes.com\n\nFollow me on Twitter @LATkarenkaplan and “like” Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.\n\nMORE IN SCIENCE\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo combat teen smoking, health experts recommend R ratings for movies that depict tobacco use\n\nPolicy change in Jakarta accidentally teaches drivers the value of carpool lanes\n\nDoes my sense of smell make me look fat? In mice, the answer seems to be yes']","If the studies “weren’t designed to show that drinking more coffee caused people to live longer,” why suggest that drinking more coffee may “extend your life”?","This Los Angeles Times story was one of many news outlets to report on a pair of large epidemiological studies on coffee-drinking and mortality. And like many of those other stories, this piece seems to assume that coffee really is healthy, although that is not proven by these or any other observational (association) studies. We think the helpful notes of caution included in the story may get drowned out by the optimistic framing of the headline and lead paragraph. Describing coffee as “good for you” suggests to readers that coffee causes health benefits — not something that these studies were designed to evaluate.
We also explored the problems with news coverage about this study in a blog post.

The results will be presented in a poster presentation titled Lung EpiCheck ™ - Results of the Training and Test Sets of a Methylation-Based Blood Test for Early Detection of Lung Cancer at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, to take place on September 22-26, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nIn the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls.\n\nIn particular, in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma group (n=162), the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85% of lung cancer patients, Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70% of patients. With a correct identification of 59% of stage I patients, 77% of stage II, 76% of stage III and 83% of stage IV patients.\n\nIn the small cell lung cancer group (n=13), Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly 92% of the patients, with a sensitivity of 100% in the limited stage, and 86% at the extensive stage.\n\n""Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease, and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages,"" stated Prof. Mina Gaga, the President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and a lead investigator in the study. ""Clearly, we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide. At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. This will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer.""\n\n""We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,"" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. ""Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort. Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population. Early detection of lung cancer can be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease, and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price.""\n\nAbout Lung EpiCheck\n\nThe Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. The technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in DNA methylation patterns, a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body. Dying tumor cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, where cancer-specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage. The Lung EpiCheck blood test detects changes in DNA methylation in 6 markers in cfDNA associated with lung cancer.\n\nAbout Lung Cancer\n\nLung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types. It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease – mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.\n\nAbout Nucleix\n\nNucleix Ltd. develops, manufactures and markets innovative, non-invasive, molecular cancer diagnostic tests. Its highly sensitive and specific tests are based on identification of subtle changes in methylation patterns. Nucleix\'s technology is based on a combination of a new biochemical assay in conjunction with sophisticated algorithms. The Company\'s pipeline includes CE Mark Bladder EpiCheck, for the non-invasive detection of bladder cancer based on a urine test; Lung EpiCheck, a screening diagnostic blood test for early detection of lung cancer; Liver EpiCheck, a blood test for liver cancer detection in patients with cirrhosis; and Pan Cancer EpiCheck, a molecular diagnostic tool for early detection of multiple cancer types in blood samples, all based on Nucleix\'s proprietary and innovative epigenetic platforms. Investors in the Company include OrbiMed and other leading investors.

However, that’s not the population that the researchers studied and reported on — the study results came from individuals known to have (or not have) cancer. The test’s ability to correctly identify cancer in a seemingly healthy population whose cancer status is unknown is an entirely different matter — and one that must be assessed in subsequent studies to determine how useful the test may or may not be for screening.
Other concerns include the lack of cost information and no mention of the harms from possible false positives or negatives.  While the release seems more targeted to potential investors than the general public we still encourage releases to include relevant information on benefits, potential harms and clear descriptions of the evidence.

Data on this drug are slated to be reviewed this summer by an FDA advisory panel. The FDA is not obligated to follow the advice of its expert panels, but it usually does.\n\nPhentermine quickly suppresses appetite, while the controlled-release topiramate decreases appetite and increases satiety throughout the day. “When the hunger comes back, the topiramate kicks in,” says study author Suzanne Oparil, MD, a professor of medicine, physiology, and biophysics and director of the vascular biology and hypertension program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Topiramate also has blood pressure-lowering effects, she says. Oparil is a consultant for Qnexa manufacturer Vivus.\n\nThe new analysis of three separate studies included more than 4,500 people. Researchers compared several doses of the new pill with placebo among severely obese adults, as well as overweight, nonobese people who had other health problems related to their weight, such as high blood pressure or metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors that increase risk for diabetes and heart disease.\n\nOverall, people who took the combination pill lost more weight than their counterparts who were given a placebo. The higher the dose, the more substantial the weight loss, and the more likely it was to be maintained over time, the study shows.\n\nAt six months, people who took the full dose of Qnexa once daily lost nearly 10% of their body weight; by one year, it was up to 10.4%. Those who took the medium dose of the pill lost 8% of their body weight at six months and 8.2% by one year. The people who took the lowest dose of the drug dropped about 5.1% of body weight at six months, and, on average, gained some back by one year.']","An overall fairly complete story that fell a bit short on explaining the blood pressure benefit, and quantifying harms.

775,story_reviews_01258,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3487/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,Injecting Migraine Pain Away,"['Injections of botulinum toxin, best known as a wrinkle treatment, are now being used increasingly to prevent chronic migraine sufferers. Scientific data are mixed, but two large recent studies show Botox can reduce the number of headache days in chronic sufferers.\n\nMigraine headache is a debilitating neurological condition that manifests itself as an intense throbbing pain on one or both sides of the head, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, a New York nonprofit. Some 14 million people experience migraine attacks nearly every day, and attacks typically last from four to 72 hours, according to the foundation. The causes of migraines aren\'t fully understood, and oral medications—while helpful for some—leave others still suffering, doctors say.\n\nBotulinum toxin is a bacterial protein that scientists say blocks chemicals responsible for muscle contractions and pain. Botox—a form of the toxin sold by Allergan Inc. of Irvine, Calif.—was approved this fall as a migraine treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It is approved to treat chronic migraine sufferers, defined as people who suffer from headaches on 15 or more days per month with headaches lasting four hours a day or longer.\n\nTim Foley\n\nAllergan, whose Botox drug is the only botulinum toxin FDA-approved to treat migraines, recommends an injection regime of 31 shots a session in seven separate locations on the head, neck and shoulders. Costs per session range from $1,000 to $1,500 or more, and are sometimes covered by insurance. The shots should be repeated every three months, Allergan says.\n\n""What I tell my patients is that Botox is probably the most well-studied therapy for chronic migraine, and has the best evidence"" of efficacy, says Sheena K. Aurora, director of the Swedish Pain and Headache Center in Seattle and a principal investigator on two recent Allergan-funded studies. Chronic migraine sufferers are a poorly studied patient group, she adds, because their condition is so hard to treat that most pharmaceutical companies exclude them from migraine studies altogether.\n\nOther physicians, such as Joel Saper, director of the Michigan Headache & Neurological Institute in Ann Arbor, who has participated in an Allergan-funded study, are more cautious. Botox ""does not help everybody,"" Dr. Saper says. ""It may not even help most everyone. But it does in my personal anecdotal experience help some people.""\n\nIf patients are overusing other medications due to chronic headache pain, he adds, it is important to discontinue those medications before beginning Botox because the medication overuse can actually make the headaches worse. Other physicians say Botox treatments will help patients discontinue medication overuse on their own.\n\nThe best evidence so far for Botox\'s use for migraines comes from two Allergan-funded studies on a combined total of 1,384 patients at 122 study sites across North America and Europe. Compared with injections of salt water, the studies—published online in March in the journal Cephalagia—found that Botox injections reduced the number of days with headaches. In the second study, for example, those treated with Botox had the number of headache days in a 28-day period drop to 11 from 20. Those getting the salt-water treatment saw headache days drop to 13 from 20.\n\nBut even those studies had mixed results, with the first study not showing a reduction in the number of headache episodes compared with placebo. Headache episodes are different from headache days because some people have single episodes that last for days, says Mitchell Brin, Allergan\'s senior vice president, global drug development and an author on both papers. Headache days is a better, more sensitive measure of effectiveness, he adds.\n\nThe study subjects included only very severe chronic migraine sufferers. Doctors can legally use Botox to treat people who with less severe migraine history if they like, but ""there is no good evidence"" that it will work, says Dr. Brin. Earlier trials looked at patients who experienced fewer than 15 migraine days a month and didn\'t find a significant treatment effect, he adds.\n\nIt is also legal for doctors to use other forms of botulinum toxin to treat migraines. Other injections may work, scientists say, but ""it\'s absolutely clear that the data exists for Botox and not the other drugs,"" says David Simpson, a professor of neurology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and a consultant to Allergan and several other makers of botulinum toxin.\n\nSide effects from botulinium toxins can include temporary weakness in face muscles, where eyes may not close fully or eyelids droop. In very rare cases, botulinum toxins can weaken muscles throughout the body—causing a lack of bladder control, trouble speaking, swallowing and breathing. Those side effects—while potentially fatal—are very unlikely at the doses used for migraine treatment, Dr. Simpson says.\n\nWrite to Laura Johannes at aches@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Starting with the “Injecting migraine pain away” headline and continuing through a string of inputs from people on the Botox payroll, this story may have left readers with an unbalanced picture. </span>","A therapy for headache once given up for dead has achieved a surprising reincarnation—and a growing niche in the medical marketplace.  But does it deserve its newfound reputation as an effective treatment? The answer is “probably not.” But a Wall Sreet. Journal article never makes that clear. It oversold the efficacy of the treatment, soft-pedaled potential side-effects, and didn’t adequately emphasize that the results of this treatment are somewhat marginal.
Clinical trials in the past showed that injections of Botulinum toxin A—i.e., Botox—were ineffective in the management of tension headaches, daily headaches and episodic migraines.  An editorial in a prominent headache journal in 2006 suggested these studies marked the “end of the road” for Botox in the management of headache. (See Evers and Olesen, 2006)
But two recent clinical trials indicate that Botox injections may be somewhat effective in the prevention of chronic migraines, defined as headaches lasting at least four hours per day for at least 15 days per month.
Based on these clinical trials, the FDA recently decided to approve the marketing of Botox for this indication.  (See Aurora et al., 2010; Diener et al., 2010). However, the jury is still out on the long-term viability of this prevention strategy. Some prominent headache researchers opposed the regulatory approval of Botox for chronic migraines, pointing out that the modest advantage of Botox over dummy injections might be explained by study issues and placebo effects. (See Olesen and Tfelt-Hansen, 2010)
Newly approved therapies for difficult pain conditions often reach clinical practice without adequate evidence regarding their risks and benefits. Such is the case with Botox. This poses a challenge for patients and journalists alike.
How much weight should they give to company-sponsored studies? How seriously should they take the views of experts who have a financial relationship with the company? How should they interpret therapies that have never been compared to other standard treatments? And how much credence should they give to a treatment that only has about a 10% advantage over placebo injections? (See Olesen and Tfelt-Hansen, 2010)
On the surface, an article in the Wall Street Journal navigated this tricky area competently. It provided a skeletal description of the two trials. The journalist clearly identified the evidence from the two studies as conflicting. The article presented both enthusiastic and skeptical views of the effectiveness of Botox.
But the article veered too close to the viewpoint of Botox proponents. It quoted a researcher who is also a senior vice-president of the company that developed this injection therapy—as well as experts who have financial relationships with this company.  It didn’t adequately describe some of the potential flaws in the two clinical trials.
And it didn’t specify the need for further independent research to document that this treatment actually provides a clinically significant treatment advantage—and not just a statistically significant advantage over injections of a salt solution.

However, this approach also affects fat tissue and can lead to excessive weight gain, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.\n\nResearchers at the University of Edinburgh\'s British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science studied another steroid called corticosterone, which is also naturally produced by the body. Until now, there has been little research into its activity.\n\nIn a mouse study, the team showed that the effects of corticosterone on fat cells were reduced compared with cortisol. They found the effects were reduced because fat cells have a pump that removes corticosterone - but not cortisol - from the fat cells.\n\nThe researchers tested the therapy in a small group of patients with Addison\'s disease. The team found that corticosterone was as effective as cortisol, but had reduced effects on fat cells compared with cortisol.\n\nProfessor Brian Walker, Head of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""These findings suggest that corticosterone could provide a safer alternative to traditional cortisol replacement therapy for conditions such as Addison\'s disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia.""\n\nThe researchers say that, with further research, these findings may one-day lead to improved therapies for other conditions that respond to steroid treatment, including asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nDr Mark Nixon, of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""The discovery of this selective corticosterone pump in fat cells could lead to a completely new approach in our search for safer steroid medications.""\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, was funded by Wellcome, the British Heart Foundation, the Medical Research Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.\n\n###']",A few more cautions that the results from mice and small human trials are still preliminary were in order.,"Adrenal gland disorders such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia are controlled by steroid treatments, usually cortisol, which can lead to weight gain, high blood pressure and diabetes. Researchers here are testing another of the body’s steroids, corticosterone, and find in basic studies that it may avoid some of those symptoms. This release does a nice job of explaining the outcomes of these studies and comparing them to typical outcomes of cortisol use. But it is less adept at reminding readers that the research to date is far shy of the clinical studies needed to determine the efficacy of this new treatment.

At that time, the group, which represents about 60,000 pediatricians nationwide, concluded that there was no clear evidence for or against circumcising newborns. The group affirmed that position in 2005.\n\nSince then, the popularity of circumcision in the United States has declined. Only about 56 percent of newborn males are circumcised.\n\nThe academy\'s task force spent seven years combing through the latest research, analyzing more than a thousand studies. Their conclusion?\n\nFor starters, Blank says, circumcision helps baby boys pretty much immediately.\n\n""The health benefits of male circumcision include a drop in the risk of urinary tract infection in the first year of life by up to 90 percent,"" she says.\n\nBut there\'s a much bigger reason to do it, Blank said. Circumcised males are far less likely to get infected with a long list of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n""It drops the risk of heterosexual HIV acquisition by about 60 percent. It drops the risk of human papillomavirus [HPV], herpes virus and other infectious genital ulcers,"" she says.\n\nIt also reduces the chances that men will spread HPV to their wives and girlfriends, protecting them from getting cervical cancer.\n\n""We\'ve reviewed the data and, you know, we have gone through them with a fine-tooth comb, and the data are pretty convincing,"" she says.\n\nCritics, however, were not convinced. They liken the procedure to female genital mutilation.\n\n""We have no right as parents or as physicians or adults to strap them down and chop off a normal part of their body. To do that is a human rights violation and an ethical travesty,"" says Georgeanne Chapin of the anti-circumcision group Intact America.\n\nChapin and other critics argue that the scientific evidence is questionable. For one thing, the studies about HIV have only been done in Africa, where AIDS is much more common among heterosexuals.\n\n""They\'re cherry-picking their evidence,"" she says. ""They act as though there\'s this huge body of literature. It\'s all the same couple of studies that have been regurgitated and reprogrammed. Over the past 150 years, all kinds of medical benefits have been proposed as resulting from cutting off the foreskin, and they have all been disproven.""\n\nCritics also question the safety of the procedure, saying too many boys are damaged for life by botched circumcisions.\n\nBut many experts say the academy is making the right call. They dismiss any comparison to female genital mutilation as grossly misleading and say male circumcision is about as safe as any procedure could be.\n\nSome think the academy\'s position is long overdue, and that the group should have gone even further and more forcefully recommended circumcision.\n\n""I think that all healthy newborn babies should be circumcised,"" says Edgar Schoen, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco. ""I feel about newborn circumcision the way I do about immunization: It\'s a potent preventive health procedure that gives you a health advantage.""\n\nFor its part, the pediatricians group hopes the new recommendations will encourage more parents to circumcise their sons — and more insurance plans to pay for it. As Shots reported last week, a lot of state Medicaid programs have stopped covering circumcision.\n\n""Those families who choose circumcision should have access to circumcision. Cost should not be a barrier,"" Blank says.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been promising for years now to issue the government\'s first guidelines about circumcision. But the CDC keeps delaying it and still has not said when that will happen.']",A reasonable report on a new policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics.,"This story adequately addressed most of our criteria; exceptions were actual costs and better discussion of potential harms.

The results, published in the Journal of Addiction Research & Therapy, show that 66 per cent of respondents reported an improvement in respiratory symptoms, 29 per cent reported no change and 5 per cent reported worsening.\n\nSenior author Professor Peter Hajek from QMUL said: ""There is no doubt that e-cigarettes are much safer than conventional cigarettes, but smokers are still led to believe that they\'re dangerous. This misinformation includes a misreported study on rats that claimed that vaping may increase vulnerability to infections. These new findings from human vapers show that this is not the case.\n\n""The study needs to be interpreted with caution because it is based on self-reported data, and further studies using objective measures are needed. However, the present results provide sufficient information to suggest that vaping does not increase infection rates and may in fact lead to a decrease in infections.""\n\nSome previous cell and animal studies have been interpreted as suggesting that vaping may increase vulnerability to infection, but these studies did not use realistic exposure levels. Human trials have reported no significant adverse respiratory effects associated with e-cigarette use for up to 1.5 years and a follow-up study of smokers with asthma who switched to vaping found significant improvements.\n\nThe researchers say that it is not surprising that the survey respondents noticed improvements in their respiratory health. This is because smoking increases susceptibility to respiratory infections and stopping smoking can be expected to have a positive effect. In addition to this, vaping may also provide some antimicrobial protection through the e-liquid ingredient propylene glycol, though further evidence is needed to confirm this.\n\nThe main limitation of the study is that the reports are subjective. Future studies should assess respiratory symptoms objectively and on unselected samples of vapers. Despite the limitations, the researchers say that the study provides a reasonable reassurance that vaping does not promote respiratory infections and may in fact reduce them.\n\n###\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nJoel Winston\n\nPublic Relations Manager (School of Medicine and Dentistry)\n\nQueen Mary University of London\n\nj.winston@qmul.ac.uk\n\nTel: +44 (0)20 7882 7943 / +44 (0)7970 096 188\n\nNotes to the editor\n\n* Research paper: \'Changes in the Frequency of Airway Infections in Smokers who Switched to Vaping: Results of an Online Survey\'.

The news release cautions readers about limitations of the survey, which was published in the Journal of Addiction Research & Therapy, though we don’t think it goes far enough in describing those drawbacks. We disagree with its assertion that the survey provides “a reasonable reassurance that vaping does not promote respiratory infections.”
A survey does not equate to scientific evidence that vaping is safe, as the news release suggests. A self reported survey of conventional cigarette smokers might help make a comparison, but it still wouldn’t be a controlled trial with verified findings. There’s no data on the extent of reported improvements, which means vaping could still contribute to lung infections, just not to the extent of regular cigarettes. The news release also should have mentioned that one author of the report has done work for several e-cigarette makers.

Smartphone device could screen for infertility,"['What would happen if screening for male infertility was just about as easy as taking a pregnancy test in your home bathroom?\n\nThat’s the question researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital tried to answer when they went about developing a smartphone-based test that men could use to test their semen in the comfort of their homes.\n\nThe test delivered impressive results, identifying abnormal semen samples with approximately 98 percent accuracy according to the researchers, who published their findings Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nInfertility affects up to 12 percent of the male population worldwide. Though it’s as common as female infertility, it often goes unrecognized due to factors like cultural stigma, the high cost and time required for testing, and access to laboratory facilities.\n\nAs things stand now, men have to provide samples “in these specific rooms in hospitals under so much stress and embarrassment,” the study’s principal investigator, Hadi Shafiee, PhD, told CBS News.\n\nHis team’s new approach aims to change that with a simple and inexpensive at-home test option.\n\nThe smartphone-based test involves several distinct parts: one, a disposable device on which to place the sample, including a disposable microchip that handles the sample; two, an optical attachment that connects to a smartphone; three, an app that guides the user through each step of testing. The researchers say the optical attachment could be created by 3D-printing, and the device would only cost about $5.\n\nThe testing kit also includes a tiny weight scale that connects wirelessly to the testing app and measures the total number of sperm swimming in the sample.\n\nThe March 22, 2017 cover of the journal Science Translational Medicine depicts a smartphone-based test for male infertility. Gilank Bara Verdana / Ravastra Design Studio, Science Translational Medicine\n\nThe researchers tested the device on 350 clinical semen specimens in Massachusetts, including both trained and untrained users in their trial.\n\n“The accuracy of this approach was very similar to that of computer-assisted laboratory analysis, even when it was performed by untrained users with no clinical background,” they wrote in the study.\n\nThe app is similar to a fitness tracker, in a sense, in that it stores any history of previous semen samples as well. The app’s user experience is hard to forget: users can see vivid moving images of their sperm right on the screen.\n\nThough the system is in the prototyping stage, it could eventually shake up the world of fertility testing by allowing men to evaluate their sperm in their own homes and helping health centers with fewer resources offer easy, cheap testing.\n\nIn addition, the developers say it could also potentially be used by men who have had a vasectomy to monitor their progress at home following surgery. Currently, they’re required to make office visits to a urologist for several months to ensure that the operation was successful.\n\nShafiee’s team plans to continue refining the test and then file for approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Several other home-based tests are already on the market, but Boston researchers say their version can analyze additional aspects of the sample, checking how well the sperm move (known as motility) as well as their concentration.\n\nMale infertility has a range of root causes, from low or abnormal sperm production to blockages to illness.']",The story focuses on the many unvetted possibilities of this device; it could “shake up the world of fertility testing” and it “could also potentially be used by men who have had a vasectomy to monitor their progress.”,"This story from CBS News teases readers with the promise of an at-home sperm test that may be as easy as a pregnancy test, yet readers aren’t given the basic information they need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the research on the device.

That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, however, experts wrote that using CT scans to gauge bone density could lead to some people being incorrectly diagnosed, particularly if people at low risk are tested.\n\nIn this study, the average age was about 59 years old - six years younger than the age at which the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel, recommends all women begin being screened for osteoporosis. The disease affects over 12 million Americans over 50.\n\nThe panel also suggests younger women at an increased risk for bone fractures should be screened, but there’s no recommendation for men of any age.\n\nDespite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. CT scans, however, are considered overused - with more than 80 million performed in the U.S. during 2011.\n\n‘INCIDENTALOPOROSIS?’\n\nFor the new study, the researchers analyzed test results from 1,867 patients, who had both types of scans performed within six months of each other over a 10-year period, to see if their CT scans showed osteoporosis as well as the DXAs.\n\nOverall, about 23 percent of the people were diagnosed with osteoporosis, about 45 percent were diagnosed with some bone-weakening and about 32 percent were healthy based on their DXAs.\n\nThe researchers then found that their ability to accurately diagnose those same patients with osteoporosis from a CT scan depended on what threshold for bone density they used.\n\nDr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit “incidentaloporosis” - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses “discovered” while doctors were looking for something else.\n\nAt the lower threshold, the researchers found 9 percent of those diagnosed with osteoporosis were misdiagnosed.\n\nPickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.\n\n“Obviously it’s something we need to worry about, but if you apply it to a population that’s suitable for diagnosis you wouldn’t run that risk,” he said.\n\nCT v. DXA\n\nMajumdar, a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta in Canada, said CT scans are better tests, but stomach scans don’t include the hip - like a DXA would.\n\nA DXA can cost a couple hundred dollars, while a CT scan can cost about $500. Both involve radiation.\n\nDr. Beatrice Hull, from the Center for Osteoporosis and Bone Health at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, told Reuters Health that she’d want her patients to have a DXA scan even with a diagnosis from a CT scan.\n\n“I don’t think at this point this one test is going to prevent further testing. I think it will identify patients who are at a higher risk and need more testing,” said Hull, who wasn’t involved with the new research.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/Zwi3u5 Annals of Internal Medicine, online April 15, 2013.']","Good details in reporting on the study, and valuable additional context and perspectives.","This story rose above simply rehash-reporting of what the study found and added important perspectives to help readers understand the possibilities but the limitations of looking at CT scans for signs of osteoporosis.

The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us.\n\nAging remains a surprisingly mysterious process. A wealth of past scientific research has shown that many bodily and cellular processes change in undesirable ways as we grow older. But science has not been able to establish definitively whether such changes result primarily from the passage of time — in which case they are inevitable for anyone with birthdays — or result at least in part from lifestyle, meaning that they are mutable.\n\nThis conundrum is particularly true in terms of inactivity. Older people tend to be quite sedentary nowadays, and being sedentary affects health, making it difficult to separate the effects of not moving from those of getting older.\n\nIn the new study, which was published this week in The Journal of Physiology, scientists at King’s College London and the University of Birmingham in England decided to use a different approach.\n\nThey removed inactivity as a factor in their study of aging by looking at the health of older people who move quite a bit.\n\n“We wanted to understand what happens to the functioning of our bodies as we get older if we take the best-case scenario,” said Stephen Harridge, senior author of the study and director of the Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King’s College London.\n\nTo accomplish that goal, the scientists recruited 85 men and 41 women aged between 55 and 79 who bicycle regularly. The volunteers were all serious recreational riders but not competitive athletes. The men had to be able to ride at least 62 miles in six and a half hours and the women 37 miles in five and a half hours, benchmarks typical of a high degree of fitness in older people.\n\nThe scientists then ran each volunteer through a large array of physical and cognitive tests. The scientists determined each cyclist’s endurance capacity, muscular mass and strength, pedaling power, metabolic health, balance, memory function, bone density and reflexes. They also had the volunteers complete the so-called Timed Up and Go test, during which someone stands up from a chair without using his or her arms, briskly walks about 10 feet, turns, walks back and sits down again.\n\nThe researchers compared the results of cyclists in the study against each other and also against standard benchmarks of supposedly normal aging. If a particular test’s numbers were similar among the cyclists of all ages, the researchers considered, then that measure would seem to be more dependent on activity than on age.\n\nAs it turned out, the cyclists did not show their age. On almost all measures, their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age. As a group, even the oldest cyclists had younger people’s levels of balance, reflexes, metabolic health and memory ability.\n\nAnd their Timed Up and Go results were exemplary. Many older people require at least 7 seconds to complete the task, with those requiring 9 or 10 seconds considered to be on the cusp of frailty, Dr. Harridge said. But even the oldest cyclists in this study averaged barely 5 seconds for the walk, which is “well within the norm reported for healthy young adults,” the study authors write.\n\nSome aspects of aging did, however, prove to be ineluctable. The oldest cyclists had less muscular power and mass than those in their 50s and early 60s and considerably lower overall aerobic capacities. Age does seem to reduce our endurance and strength to some extent, Dr. Harridge said, even if we exercise.\n\nBut even so, both of those measures were higher among the oldest cyclists than would be considered average among people aged 70 or above.\n\nAll in all, the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active.\n\n“If you gave this dataset to a clinician and asked him to predict the age” of one of the cyclists based on his or her test results, Dr. Harridge said, “it would be impossible.” On paper, they all look young.\n\nOf course, this study is based on a single snapshot of an unusual group of older adults, Dr. Harridge said. He and his colleagues plan to retest their volunteers in five and 10 years, which will provide better information about the ongoing effects of exercise on aging.\n\nBut even in advance of those results, said Dr. Harridge, himself almost 50 and an avid cyclist, this study shows that “being physically active makes your body function on the inside more like a young person’s.”']",The research reported on here isn’t strong enough to back up the story’s provocative claims.,"This story questions whether our understanding of aging on a basic science level may be wrong, based on a single small study of only 125 cycling enthusiasts. There is novelty in the decision to study active seniors exclusively and certain tests showed less of a decline in function than one would otherwise expect. But the story’s central claim that “many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us” appears hype. No expert is quoted outside of the study’s own authors to support that claim.

In fact, 7.4 million women ages 15 to 44 have used infertility services in their lifetimes.\n\nPamela’s doctors said her fallopian tubes were blocked and that her only options to get pregnant would be with surgery or in vitro fertilization (IVF)— options Pamela did not want to try.\n\n“I hate needles, and I didn’t want to go through all the emotions and the hormone shots,” said Pamela, who added that her health insurance would have paid for three IVF cycles.\n\nAdhesions— which are comprised of internal scar tissue that forms after surgery, infection or trauma— can cause fallopian tubes to become blocked. And if the mucus that lines the tubes is too thick, this can also contribute to blockage. When one or both tubes are blocked, the egg cannot travel to the uterus and the sperm cannot reach the egg.\n\n“After they told me that I would have to do IVF, I started looking for natural ways to solve infertility,” Soto said.\n\nBy doing a quick Google search, Pamela and her husband, John Henry Soto, found Clear Passage, a physical therapy clinic in Gainesville, Fla., that treats certain causes of female infertility like blocked fallopian tubes, endometriosis and hormonal dysfunction.\n\nClear Passage therapists use their hands to soften and massage away adhesions blocking the tubes.\n\n""We feel and we check all the organs in the abdomen and the pelvis, and wherever we feel that tissues or organs won\'t move in a certain direction with our hands, we’ll stretch them [in that direction], and we’ll hold that stretch until the tissues and adhesions start to deform and give way,"" Belinda Wurn, a physical therapist and co-developer of the Clear Passage treatment, told FoxNews.com.\n\nPhysical therapists administer the deep massage-like therapy over five days and 20 hours total.\n\n“It was an uncomfortable pressure,” Pamela said. “I wouldn\'t describe it as a massage at all. It was like physical therapy— it didn\'t hurt, but it wasn\'t a good feeling either.""\n\nIn a retrospective study of 1,392 infertile women, published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, the treatment showed a 60 percent success rate in opening at least one fallopian tube and a 57 percent pregnancy rate for women whose tubes have opened.\n\n""We have enough data on enough patients to where we feel were statistically significant in opening blocked tubes, treating endometriosis and treating elevated follicle stimulating hormone,"" Dr. Richard King, a gynecologist and the medical director for Clear Passage Physical Therapy, told FoxNews.com.\n\nEight months after Pamela received therapy at Clear Passage, she discovered she was pregnant. She wrapped her positive pregnancy test in a box and surprised her husband with the news on Father’s Day.\n\n""I can’t even imagine not having (our daughter) Brianna in our lives right now. She’s just brought so much joy to our lives,"" John Henry Soto told FoxNews.com\n\nIn case the Sotos want to try for a second child, King says their therapy has shown long-lasting results.\n\n“We found that this treatment probably lasts a long period of time because we’ve had a lot of patients with blocked fallopian tubes that we’ve done this 20-hour protocol to that have had more than one child,” King said.\n\nAlthough the founders tout the therapy’s success, some fertility experts have expressed skepticism over their findings.\n\n“When you’re talking about a retrospective report, you’re saying, ‘OK, we treated these people, and these are our results.’ And that’s interesting, and their results were good in some sections, but it\'s not scientific in the sense of a prospective, randomized, controlled study,” Dr. Joel Batzofin, a fertility specialist at New York Fertility Services, a part of ARC fertility, told FoxNews.com. “They [the patients] were not stratified by disease type, by age, by duration of infertility, by body weight, smokers versus non-smokers, ever pregnant versus never pregnant, male factors— these are all things that have a profound bearing on results.”\n\nAlthough Batzofin pointed out the importance of further study, he said the therapy may a be useful option for some patients.\n\n“There are women that produce mucus of a thick viscus quality, and it sticks and lodges in there. The fallopian tube at the uterine end is very narrow and it gets blocked in there, so it’s quite easy to imagine that a course of physical therapy is going to soften this up, dislodge it and clear the passage,” Batzofin said.\n\nBatzofin added that compared to surgery or IVF, the side effects are minimal.\n\n“I don’t think that it’s going to be harmful,” he said. “But one has to be careful about raising false expectations.”\n\nThe Clear Passage therapy costs around $6,000, and some insurance plans may cover it.\n\nFor more information, visit ClearPassage.com.']",This story did a reasonable job of reporting on a study about the use of massage to treat infertility. It would’ve been stronger had it pointed out the study’s high dropout rate.,"This story reports on a retrospective study looking at a form of massage therapy that is designed to treat infertility, with the claim that it is an alternative to surgery or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) in dealing with blocked fallopian tubes. The theory is that massage may help remove adhesions— scar tissue that forms after surgery, infection or trauma and can block fallopian tubes, preventing pregnancy. This concept may have appeal for women who wish to avoid invasive treatment. The story earns points for including a valuable comment from an infertility expert, who rightfully points to some of the many limitations in the study used to back the claim that massage therapy is effective for tubal infertility. However, its quantification of benefits, which doesn’t factor in the high number of women who were never contacted for follow-up on their results, will likely leave readers with an inflated sense of the effectiveness of this approach.

Brennan, MD, study author and Chief Medical Officer, CVS Health. ""Our research shows that home infusion care is a promising model that is both cost- and clinically-effective and is overwhelmingly preferred by patients when intravenous therapy is required.""\n\nResearchers conducted a systematic review of existing peer-reviewed research evaluating infusion care for several conditions, including cystic fibrosis, antibiotics following orthopedic surgery and several cancers requiring infused chemotherapies. Researchers compared measures of quality, safety, clinical outcomes, quality of life and costs of home infusion services to those provided in medical settings. The research showed that patients receiving intravenous therapy at home had as good or better clinical outcomes as those patients who received the same therapy in a traditional health care setting. In addition, patients overwhelmingly preferred receiving their infusion therapies at home, reporting fewer disruptions in personal schedules and responsibilities. The costs associated with home infusion were also consistently lower than services provided in a health care facility, with savings ranging between $1,928 and $2,974 per course of treatment.\n\n""At CVS Health, we provide important home infusion services to patients through Coram, which is just one of the ways we are expanding our clinical delivery model and helping to move important health services to lower cost sites of care,"" added Alan Lotvin, MD, Executive Vice President, CVS Specialty. ""In fact, our patients report high satisfaction with our Coram home infusion services, citing convenience and comfort as key elements that improved their overall experience.""\n\n\n\nHome infusion services are a rapidly growing delivery model in the health care system with rising rates of chronic and acute conditions that require intravenous therapy. Despite this, clinical outcomes and quality of care have not previously been systematically evaluated. While many commercial health plans provide comprehensive coverage for home infusion services, Medicare has limited reimbursement for this type of care, and Congress is discussing how to implement a comprehensive home infusion benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nCoram, a service provided by CVS Health, provides vital infusion care and support to tens of thousands of Americans each month with a range of conditions including immune deficiencies, rheumatoid arthritis and serious infections requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy. Care is administered by experienced infusion nurses and pharmacists, and in addition, patients receive additional disease management education and support throughout their treatment.\n\nThe CVS Health Research Institute is focused on contributing to the body of scientific knowledge related to pharmacy and health care through research collaborations with external academic institutions, participation in federally-funded research, analysis and sharing of CVS Health data sources and coordination of pilot programs and initiatives. CVS Health Research Institute findings support a continuous quality improvement environment, which encourages product innovation and development to benefit CVS Health patients, clients and their members.\n\nAbout CVS Health\n\nCVS Health (NYSE: CVS) is a pharmacy innovation company helping people on their path to better health.

Home infusion appears safe and clinically effective while saving money in the studies reviewed, but the release does not address limits in the review. We aren’t given any numbers to back up the claims that clinical outcomes were equal and that patients preferred the home setting. The release notes that CVS has a home infusion business–Coram–so at least they make this transparent. We applaud CVS for attempting to quantify the cost savings and other potential benefits of the service — and the claim that there are advantages are likely valid — but some context/background from other, independent studies would be helpful. Besides the lack of quantification, the release doesn’t delve into the potential risks from using the home infusion service.

By the third week, he said, both he and friends he asked for reactions were seeing results. “I even busted out the old ‘before’ and ‘after’ pictures,” he said. “It was a noticeable difference.”\n\nBut Latisse does not appear to be a silver bullet for hair loss. Instead, it appears to work in much the same way as Rogaine or Propecia: All three can strengthen and darken hair that grows from a dying follicle, but none can bring a dead one back to life. The result is an enhanced, refortified hairline rather than a brand new head of hair.\n\nPhoto\n\nAside from hair transplants, which can cost about $10,000 each and do not always look natural, the only current hope for complete replacement is hair cloning, the act of producing entirely new hair from the DNA of an existing one, which researchers have been attempting, unsuccessfully, for years.\n\nA pair of researchers last year claimed to grow new hair by combining plucked hair with a wound-healing powder made by ACell, a regenerative-medicine company in Columbia, Md. Though the claim was met with some skepticism by other clinicians, the idea that ACell’s powder, which has been approved by the government, could facilitate new hair growth has breathed new life into the race to clone hair.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Robert M. Bernstein, clinical professor of dermatology at Columbia University, is now one of several researchers experimenting with the product.\n\n“It’s just a question of time now” before hair cloning becomes a reality, Dr. Bernstein said. “We keep on moving back that time, but I think there’s absolutely no doubt that it’s going to be done.”\n\nHe believes hair cloning will be commercially available within 10 years. This may sound like a long time to wait, but “it’s important to remember that baldness is unlike other conditions where you can progress past the point of being helped,” Dr. Bernstein said. “Once we have a cure for hair loss, everyone will be able to benefit.”\n\nPhoto\n\nIt has been been 14 years since the F.D.A. approved a new hair-loss remedy (Propecia, in 1997), so it is understandable that anticipation for a new one might be running high. One advantage of Latisse is that it needs to be applied only once a day (Rogaine needs to be applied twice; Propecia is taken once daily), and does not seem to cause reactions in people who are allergic to minoxidil.\n\nIt is, however, expensive: a month’s supply of Latisse can cost up to $150, and that is in amounts appropriate for use merely on the eyelashes. Rogaine, which is also available over the counter now, costs about $25 a month, and a month’s supply of Propecia runs about $75. (Even Mr. Paduda has now switched to Propecia, citing cost.)\n\nThe potential for Latisse is not lost on Allergan. The company initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in August to determine whether bimatoprost can be used as a treatment in men and women suffering from hair loss (alopecia).\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The present study was aimed to investigate whether such changes can be reversed by daily melatonin ingestion.\n\nThe older we get, the more likely our circadian rhythms are disrupted. For example, blood pressure (BP), not only tends to increase but as well become more irregular. Luckily, as we show in our research, melatonin helps to ameliorate both trends.\n\n63 senior respondents of a mean age of 80 were studied during 3 consecutive weeks. First week control data were collected for 7 successive days. Over the next 2 weeks, the seniors were administered a low dose of melatonin (1.5 mg) each day by night at 10:30 p.m. On the third week data were monitored again.\n\nMelatonin significantly reduced BP. The hypotensive effect was dependent on time. The maximum systolic BP lowering effect of melatonin falls between 3:00 and 8:00 in the morning, the time of the highest risk of heart attacks and strokes. Nighttime and morning BP decreased more profoundly on average -8/3.5 mm Hg for SBP/DBP, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the higher the mean systolic BP was during the first week, the more it dropped on the second week of melatonin administration. Melatonin also decreased the overall variability in BP.\n\nMelatonin ws effective in synchronizing disrupted circadian rhythms of BP, heart rate and body temperature, making these circadian rhythms smoother and less irregular. None of these effects was found in 34 placebo treated seniors, thus ruling out the possibility that rhythms could be improved just because of regular schedule and presence of medical personal who took measurements.\n\nIn conclusion, melatonin can be of great value for aged people suffering from hypertension as an adjuvant substance complementing basic medication as it is able to stabilize circadian BP, heart rate profiles and their phase relationships. The improvement of circadian pacemaker functions may also provide a new strategy in the treatment of hypertension.\n\n###\n\nDenis G. Gubin, Gennady D. Gubin, Ludmila I.

We’re concerned that the release doesn’t point out the serious complications that can arise when taking melatonin with other drugs, particularly since the elderly are the most likely to be on multiple medications, including drugs for high blood pressure.

The results are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nWhile most breast cancer is diagnosed at later ages, about 6% of women learn that they're ill before age 40 - when they are still of childbearing age. Breast cancer treatments that have shown the best results for for disease free survival include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or both. For younger women still hoping for children, these treatments can cause devastating short-term or long-term loss of menstrual periods, and loss of fertility. While many women choose to preserve the option of having children by storing eggs before cancer treatment, the process can be costly and difficult.\n\nItalian researchers conducted a phase three study that included 281 women with breast cancer, aged 18 to 45 years and who had not experienced menopause. Patients were randomly selected to be treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and triptorelin, a drug, called a GnRH analogue, that prevents the ovaries from releasing eggs. The researchers followed the women for one year after they had finished chemotherapy.\n\nAmong the women who had not received triptorelin, the rate of early menopause was 25.9%. Among the women who had received triptorelin, the rate of early menoapuse was 8.9%, which is 17% lower.\n\nAn accompanying editorial by Dr. Hope S. Rugo and Dr. Mitchell P. Rosen of the University of California-San Francisco says that trptorelin therapy should not be recommended as a standard treatment and should be approached with caution in women with hormone-sensitive disease. They also stress that women resuming their menstrual cycles does not mean the same thing as women preserving their fertility. They conclude that using assisted reproductive technology – such as storing eggs before chemo, is “the most effective option for fertility preservation.”""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Brief – too brief to explain what a Phase 3 study means, to discuss costs, harms, and other competing research that was clearly discussed in a journal editorial. </span>","This brief article focuses on a treatment that attempts to preserve fertility for  young (under 40) breast cancer survivors.  It does a good job of describing the potential benefits but leaves gaps in explaining some of the potential limitations and side effects, in particular the failure to mention the potential adverse affects on disease outcome.

Now, a new study suggests a program of education and exercise may provide relief.\n\nHelping patients think differently about pain and encouraging them to move in ways they previously feared appears to ease pain and improve function, researchers say.\n\n""People with chronic neck and/or back pain should be educated about their pain, [and] should be reassured,"" said lead researcher Anneleen Malfliet.\n\nThey should ""learn to put pain into the right perspective, should remain active or increase their activity levels gradually, and should avoid fear of moving,"" said Malfliet, of Vrije University Brussels in Belgium.\n\nPhysical therapists and doctors can guide patients in this process, she added.\n\n""They should also avoid the use of scary, unreassuring labels or diagnoses,"" and not limit movement in therapy, she said.\n\nTo test the experimental approach, Malfliet and her colleagues randomly assigned 22 men and 38 women to the program. They assigned another 25 men and 35 women to standard care -- exercise, and back and neck education.\n\n""The experimental therapy, focusing on functionality, not using pain as a reliable symptom, and not as a guideline to adapt movements or activities, leads to better treatment outcomes,"" Malfliet said.\n\nThe program led to a significant and clinically important reduction of pain, she said.\n\nPatients in the program reported 50 percent less pain after the treatment. They also reported paying less attention to pain.\n\nIn general, they also had less disability, a reduced fear of moving, and improvement in mental and physical outlook, according to the study authors.\n\n""These positive effects were found until the last follow-up measurement at one year after treatment,"" Malfliet said.\n\nThe program involves ""pain neuroscience education with cognition-targeted motor control training,"" she said.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nPain neuroscience education aims to change patients\' beliefs about pain, to increase their knowledge of pain and to decrease its threat, Malfliet said.\n\nBesides focusing on the makeup of the spine, the program stressed lifting techniques and stretching. Participants also learned the value of strength, endurance and fitness training.\n\nMany back patients are afraid certain movements will cause them pain, so they avoid them. The new exercises are designed to help overcome that fear, Malfliet said.\n\nThe regimen included the best known exercises for back pain and general exercises, she said. It also included group classes, online activities and personalized training sessions.\n\n""Be active, and move without fear of pain or reinjury,"" Malfliet said. ""Your level of activity or way of moving before the chronic pain began should be used as a guideline target.""\n\nWhereas back pain studies involving exercise and drugs have shown changes to the brain\'s gray matter, the program in this study found no brain changes, Malfliet said.\n\nDr. Kiran Patel is director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nPatel said the dual mental and exercise approach is used to treat phantom pain in patients after a limb amputation. It\'s rarely used for back pain, she said.\n\nBut this study suggests these methods also can help reduce spinal pain, she said.\n\n""The program, however, is quite time-intensive and is not covered by insurance,"" Patel said.\n\n""Although it\'s promising, we really have to see the benefit long-term to justify the cost,"" she added.\n\nThe report was published online April 16 in JAMA Neurology.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on lower back pain, visit the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.']",The story doesn’t really explain the differences between the standard and experimental therapies in the small trial.,"This article, based on findings of a small study of people with chronic back pain in Belgium reported in the journal JAMA Neurology, tells readers that if they can only “think differently” and stop “fearing” their pain, such attitude changes combined with “cognition-targeted motor control training” does significantly more than standard physical therapy and back pain “education” to reduce the pain and increase ability to function.
The problem is that the story doesn’t really explain the differences between the standard and experimental therapies, the latter of which is composed of a sort of physical “desensitization” to feared physical movements; and fails to offer any details about the base level of the subjects’ pain, how pain was measured, or why the researchers looked for (and didn’t find) brain changes in the study group.
We were glad the article included an outside expert, who makes clear that the experimental intervention is time intensive, costly, not covered by insurance and  — although “promising” — still unproven with respect to long-term benefit compared to standard therapies. That provided some much needed information for the reader.

But tears are most frequently caused by degeneration of the tendon due to age, rather than injury from sports or trauma. Studies show that tears can be managed without surgery in half of patients, mainly through physical therapy, pain medications, and avoiding activities that cause pain.\n\nBut one\'s strength tends not to improve without surgery to reattach tendons to the ball of the shoulder joint. So, the question for many patients who want to have full use of their shoulder is less whether to have surgery than when and how. In a recent review in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers noted that patients and doctors struggle with when to stop nonoperative treatment in favor of surgery, but that repairing a tear earlier rather than later may result in better patient outcomes, earlier return to work and lower costs.\n\nThe Price of Delay\n\n""Many patients who have a tear figure they can take six months and live with it, but left alone the tear will progress and you can get to the point where it is irreparable,"" says David Altchek, a surgeon at New York\'s Hospital for Special Surgery. Dr. Altchek says repairing torn rotator cuffs earlier with a new technique that uses a double row of sutures to fix tendons to bone, rather than a single row, is improving healing rates in his studies.\n\nWhile some tears may never worsen or need surgery, says Ken Yamaguchi, an orthopedic surgeon at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, ""the older somebody is when they get a repair, the less likely it is for the repair to heal.""\n\nThe good news is that surgery results in reduced pain and improved function in 80% to 95% of patients. And open surgery with big incisions is being replaced by new, less-invasive techniques known as mini-open and arthroscopic repair, which involve less pain and blood loss, shorter hospital stays and a generally easier rehabilitation period, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.\n\nAsk Your Doctor\n\nThe academy, which recently updated its guidelines for rotator-cuff repair, doesn\'t recommend for or against a specific technique for surgery. Dr. Yamaguchi, vice chairman of a working group that developed the guidelines, says there isn\'t enough high-quality evidence to recommend any specific technique, a conclusion also reached by the Annals of Internal Medicine researchers. He advises that patients confer with surgeons about their options.\n\nThe most common procedure is mini-open repair, which uses a smaller incision than traditional open repair. To remove any bone spurs, a surgeon uses arthroscopic, pencil-size instruments to magnify and illuminate the structures inside the joint. Once that is completed, the surgeon repairs the rotator cuff through the small incision. But some surgeons are now performing the entire operation using the small camera-guided instruments, in what\'s known as an all-arthroscopic procedure.\n\nThere are possible complications with all surgical procedures, of course. An Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons review of about 40 published studies showed that as many as 2% of patients have nerve injuries, while 1% may get an infection at the surgical site. About 6% may have a tendon re-tear, though that doesn\'t mean a repeat surgery will be needed or that pain and poor function will result.\n\nLengthy Recovery\n\nAnd as with any surgery, postoperative recovery depends largely on how well patients adhere to their physical-therapy regimens. Initially, that means being extra careful: A repair needs to be protected until the tendon heals strongly to the bone. Patients may be advised to use a sling for the first four to six weeks after surgery and to limit active use of the arm. Therapy usually starts with passive-motion exercises, then range-of-motion exercises continue during the next six to 12 weeks. It can take as long as six months after surgery to return to a functional range of motion and adequate strength.\n\nEric Taylor, a 62-year-old documentary filmmaker who plays sports like tennis with his right arm, says he was surprised when he began developing pain in his left shoulder. He tried to ease it by doing yoga, but after six months with no relief, he scheduled an MRI. It confirmed that a bone spur digging into a tendon had caused a tear in the left rotator cuff.\n\nHe scheduled surgery with Dr. Altchek at the Hospital for Special Surgery last June, but wishes he had acted sooner. Because he waited so long, he says, his surgery required three incisions instead of one. He was surprised at how much work was involved in rehabilitation but has been diligent about his recovery and physical therapy.\n\nBack to playing tennis now, Mr. Taylor says, ""When it comes to our own bodies, as baby boomers we\'ve always been active, and we are going to stay active any way we can.""\n\nMs. Landro is an assistant managing editor for The Wall Street Journal and writes the paper\'s Informed Patient column. She can be reached at next@wsj.com.']",Good writing and strong contextual information could not prevent this story from presenting a very misleading view of the evidence base for shoulder surgery.,"The Wall Street Journal took a medical review of surgical techniques that trumpeted it was “inconclusive” and wrote a story making it sound as if sugery is the best answer for rotator-cuff tears.

Until recently, only two treatments had been shown to prolong survival.\n\nAbiraterone has emerged as a potential third new treatment for prostate cancer following approval earlier this year of Jevtana, a chemotherapy agent, and Provenge, a cancer vaccine (above).\n\nResearchers reported Monday that the drug abiraterone, being developed by Johnson & Johnson, extended survival by an average of 3.9 months among men with cancer that has spread beyond the prostate and for whom other treatments have failed. Among men, prostate cancer is the second-leading cancer killer, behind only lung cancer.\n\nJohnson & Johnson plans to file for new-drug approval in the U.S. and Europe by year-end, raising prospects that the drug could be on the market next year. The drug, a pill, works by blocking production of hormones that fuel prostate tumors.\n\nThe abiraterone study, presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Milan, follows approval earlier this year of two other therapies—Jevtana, a chemotherapy agent from Sanofi-Aventis SA, and Provenge, a cancer vaccine developed by Dendreon Inc., which marshals the immune system to fight the disease.\n\n""When you have drugs that act in different ways and each is giving some measurable benefit, that is significant progress in a field where new agents have come along very rarely in the past,"" says Steve K. Clinton, director of prostate and genitourinary oncology at Ohio State University\'s James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Columbus. Dr. Clinton wasn\'t involved in the current study and doesn\'t have consulting relationships with the companies.\n\nStill, the overall improvement is modest for each therapy. Jevtana increased survival by an average of 2.4 months compared with standard chemotherapy. Provenge added an average of 4.1 months of life. Researchers say the results are impressive nevertheless because the studies involved patients whose tumors progressed after treatment with several different therapies.\n\n""These drugs are first tested in dying patients with no other therapy options and with months to live,"" says Johann de Bono, a researcher at the Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden Hospital in London. The hope, as with treatments for many cancers, is that they will lead to much longer survival when studied in patients with early-stage disease.\n\nJevtana Sanofi-Aventis U.S\n\nThe abiraterone study involved 1,195 patients from 13 countries whose disease was considered ""castration resistant,"" meaning it had progressed despite surgery or drugs to shut down production of the androgen hormone testosterone. The patients had also failed chemotherapy.\n\nThe 797 patients randomly assigned to abiraterone plus the steroid prednisone lived on average 14.8 months compared with 10.9 months for those treated with the steroid plus a placebo. The trial was stopped early after an interim data check determined the drug\'s benefit, enabling those on placebo to convert to the treatment.\n\nAbiraterone patients were more likely than those on placebo to experience side effects such as an increase in blood pressure and retention of fluids. But they didn\'t lose their hair or have an increased risk of infection—problems associated with conventional chemotherapy.\n\nAndrogen hormones, particularly testosterone, fuel prostate tumors. Conventional hormone therapy blocks androgens produced by the testes. Abiraterone appears to target androgens also produced elsewhere, even by the tumors themselves, said Dr. de Bono, who presented the study in Milan. ""These tumors are their own androgen factories.""\n\nAssuming abiraterone wins regulatory approval, oncologists will have to work out how it fits with the other new remedies. ""What we really need that we don\'t have at the moment is the wisdom to know which one to use at what time and in what order,"" Dr. Clinton says.\n\nCost could be a factor. The three-treatment Provenge regimen has been controversial partly because of the $93,000 cost. Dendreon has said treatment costs are comparable with chemotherapy if total costs of care are taken into account.\n\nChadi Nabhan, division director of hemotology/oncology at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, Park Ridge, Ill., and an investigator on Provenge studies, says he doesn\'t see the treatments as rivals. It is possible that by giving one treatment after the other, doctors will be able to extend life beyond what\'s possible with one strategy alone, he said.\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">Strong points: This story includes absolute survival numbers and other key information that can help readers put the findings in perspective. </span>","


 
The results were announced at a medical meeting, which usually means the data has not been through the level of peer review used by leading medical journals and that key information may have been withheld pending journal publication. Also the trial was halted early, which may increase the odds that the results were a fluke and that if the trial had continued as intended the final results might be different than the interim numbers presented.The early trial stoppage was mentioned, but not the possible significance of that.

Still, little is known about its cause. Breast milk is meant to exclusively supply all the nutritional needs of infants and current recommendations include exclusively breastfeeding for the first six months of life to optimize growth, development and health.\n\nEfrat L. Amitay, Ph.D., M.P.H., and Lital Keinan-Boker, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., of the University of Haifa, Israel, reviewed the evidence in 18 studies on the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia.\n\nIn a review of all 18 studies, the authors found breastfeeding for six months or longer was associated with a 19 percent lower risk compared with no breastfeeding or breastfeeding for a shorter period of time. A separate analysis of 15 studies found that ever being breastfed compared with never being breastfed was associated with an 11 percent lower risk of childhood leukemia.\n\nThe authors suggest several biological mechanisms of breast milk may explain their results, including that breast milk contains many immunologically active components and anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms that influence the development of an infant’s immune system.\n\n“Because the primary goal of public health is prevention of morbidity, health care professionals should be taught the potential health benefits of breastfeeding and given tools to assist mothers with breastfeeding, whether themselves or with referrals to others who can help. The many potential preventive health benefits of breastfeeding should also be communicated openly to the general public, not only to mothers, so breastfeeding can be more socially accepted and facilitated. In addition, more high-quality studies are needed to clarify the biological mechanisms underlying this association between breastfeeding and lower childhood leukemia morbidity,” the study concludes.\n\n(JAMA Pediatr.

This news release summarizes a published report on data from 18 separate studies worldwide that, when analyzed together, suggest breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of developing childhood or adolescent leukemia. But that’s basically the only message conveyed by the news release, which is otherwise devoid of important context, including — most importantly — on the limitations of the observational design used by all of studies in the analysis. The release’s incomplete, one-sided presentation will most likely lead to a flurry of overblown media coverage that could have negative repercussions for the many women who cannot or choose not to breastfeed.

They do not appear in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThe studies suggest that fewer physicians are recommending annual mammograms for women in their 40s, fewer patients in that age group are getting screened and that tumors found through routine mammography are more likely to be detected in early stages of cancer.\n\nThe studies examined the impact of the controversial guidelines issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal advisory board.\n\nWho decides about mammograms? Inside the task force\n\nIn November 2009, the group stated that yearly mammograms should not be automatic at age 40 and that physicians should discuss their risks and benefits with their patients. It recommended routine mammography screenings every two years for women ages 50 to 74.\n\n""The benefit in 40- to 49-year-old women is pretty small,"" said Dr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the task force, about annual mammograms. ""There is a real, but rather modest benefit. There are also risks, and they are greater in younger women than older women.""\n\nMammograms are less effective in detecting growths in younger women, whose breasts may be denser. The screening gets better with older women because breast tissues change over time.\n\nAs a result, some women experience false positives, anxiety and unnecessary biopsies because of mammograms, according to data. Roughly 15% of women in their 40s detect breast cancer through mammography.\n\nShould I get a mammogram?\n\n""The benefit is modest enough it needs to be an individual decision,"" Moyer said about mammograms for women in their 40s.\n\nThis contradicted advice from cancer groups such as the American Cancer Society and Susan G. Komen for the Cure, which told women 40 and older to get screened every year. It sparked immediate outcry from such groups and cancer survivors, who say routine mammograms for women younger than 50 can save lives.\n\nOnce-dropping U.S. breast cancer rates now stable\n\nSuspicious growths caught in regular-screening mammograms are more likely to be in early stages and therefore more treatable, said Dr. Donna Plecha, division chief of mammography at University Hospitals at Case Medical Center in Ohio.\n\nShe reviewed records of 524 biopsies (samples of suspicious growths in breasts) from women in their 40s during 2008 to 2009 at her hospital.\n\nOf the 359 biopsies from screening mammography patients, 15% had cancer. These cancers were more treatable because they were caught in earlier stages, Plecha said.\n\nAlthough 85% of those biopsies turned out to be noncancerous, some ""may show us the patient is at higher risk of breast cancer,"" she said.\n\n""I haven\'t met many patients who don\'t appreciate us being thorough, to trying to find the cancers at an early stage,"" Plecha said. ""I would still recommend screening mammograms starting at age of 40,"" because cancers caught earlier would be more curable.\n\nBreast cancer ID\'d more accurately by docs who see more scans\n\nPlecha\'s findings were not surprising to Moyer. It\'s obvious that annual screenings would catch cancers before they progress, she said.\n\nThe study presumes that catching earlier stages for women between the ages of 40-49 would translate into fewer breast cancer deaths.\n\n""The data that we have suggests that 1 in a thousand will benefit from mammograms in the 40-49 age,"" she said. ""There are whole lots of assumptions that are not supported by the data they presented.""\n\nThe task force did not say don\'t get mammograms, Moyer said.\n\n""It might make women not want to get the test,"" she said. ""This is a decision that should belong to the woman with appropriate info on hand.""\n\nIn another study, Dr. Lara Hardesty, section chief of breast imaging at the University of Colorado Hospital, examined survey results from fewer than 50 internists, gynecologists, family practitioners and nurse midwives.\n\nShe found that fewer clinicians were recommending annual mammograms after the task force\'s guidelines were issued.\n\nBefore the guidelines, 56% recommended yearly mammograms for women in the 40- to 49-year-old range. After the guidelines, that rate decreased to 20%, and 56% of the clinicians reported they were discussing the risks and benefits of screening with patients. That decrease, Hardesty said, ""is a statistically significant difference,"" but it also showed more doctors were discussing mammograms with patients.\n\nHardesty also found that there were 205 fewer mammograms among women in their 40s after the guidelines were issued. Among patients 50 and older, mammograms increased slightly from 4,479 patients to 4,498.\n\nIt was unclear why mammograms in the 40s decreased while older women\'s mammograms increased slightly.\n\nHardesty offered this hypothesis: Older women are used to having annual mammograms because they\'ve done it for years. Meanwhile, younger women may feel as though they don\'t have to get this screening.\n\nAlthough the task force concluded that the net benefit of mammography in the 40s is small, Hardesty said: ""If you\'re the one person we find your cancer, it\'s the world to you.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">We could split hairs about the overall balance in the piece, but generally this was a good job – far better than the competing <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3877"" target=""_blank"">Denver Post story</a> on the same studies.

Doctors often give Lucentis less frequently, but even if that regimen produces good results, patients must still get checkups every month to make sure their vision is not deteriorating.\n\nRegeneron’s drug, which is called VEGF Trap-Eye, “gives us the opportunity to not have to see them monthly,” said Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Boston, an investigator in one of the trials and a consultant to Regeneron. That would be “very meaningful to patients and their families,” he said.\n\nRegeneron and its partner, Bayer, said they planned to apply for approval of the drug in the first half of 2011.\n\nThe two similar trials involved a total of 2,457 patients who were randomly chosen to receive either Lucentis every four weeks or VEGF Trap-Eye either every four weeks or every eight weeks. In the eight-week arm, the first three doses were given every four weeks.\n\nAfter a year, roughly 95 percent of the patients in all the arms of the trial maintained their vision, meaning their ability to read an eye chart declined by no more than 15 letters, or three lines.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye was also “noninferior” to Lucentis in terms of the average change in vision after one year. Lucentis recipients had a mean gain of 8.1 letters and 9.4 letters in the two trials. Those getting Regeneron’s drug every eight weeks had gains of 7.9 letters and 8.9 letters.\n\nRegeneron said the two drugs were equally safe.\n\nBoth VEGF Trap-Eye and Lucentis block a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor that causes blood vessels to grow and leak into the eye.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When used in the eye, Avastin costs about $50 a dose, compared with about $2,000 for Lucentis. Still, even with such low-priced competition, Lucentis has sales exceeding $2 billion globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Advanced Cell Technology, of Marlborough, Mass., said it would test its stem cell therapy on 12 adults with severe vision loss caused by Stargardt’s, an inherited disease.\n\nThe company has turned human embryonic stem cells into retinal pigment epithelial cells, which will be surgically implanted into the eye. The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease.\n\nHuman embryonic stem cells are controversial because their creation usually entails the destruction of human embryos, although Advanced Cell Technology is working on a technique to avoid that.\n\nEmbryonic cells can also form tumors if injected into the body. Dr. Robert Lanza, chief scientist at Advanced Cell, said the company had to prove to the F.D.A. that its retinal cells contained virtually no residual embryonic stem cells. It took a year for the company to get clearance for the trial from the F.D.A.\n\nIt is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Still, even starting the trial could be a boost to Advanced Cell, which often makes headlines but has struggled to raise money. Its shares closed at 5 cents on Friday.\n\nDr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible. Also, he said, there is less chance of rejection of the implanted cells because the eye is shielded somewhat from the body’s immune system.\n\nThere is no treatment for Stargardt’s, which affects more than 25,000 people in the United States.

That previous finding was “very good news in the field,” said Dr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, who treats lung cancer patients and reviewed the results for Reuters Health.\n\nThis latest study, published in the journal Lung Cancer, looked at death rates in a different, smaller population of heavy smokers, and estimated that those who received up to two CT scans would have between a 36 and 64 percent lower risk of dying, compared to those who went unscreened.\n\nThe data are “consistent” with earlier studies but there are still many issues to resolve regarding lung cancer screening, Johnson said.\n\nFor one, scientists haven’t yet worked out how often to screen people, and when to start. It is not clear when or how guidelines for lung cancer screening could be drawn up, and until they are, insurers including government programs such as Medicare are unlikely to pay the average $300 cost of a scan.\n\nFurthermore, an April study showed that 21 percent of a patient’s initial lung CT scans show suspicious lesions that turn out not to be cancer, but lead to needless invasive follow-up procedures and radiation exposure, as well as stress and anxiety for patients and their families.\n\nThe high so-called “false positive” rate is an issue, said Dr. James Hanley of McGill University, who also reviewed the findings for Reuters Health, but many mammograms also find lesions that turn out to be benign. And for lung cancer, doctors know there is a high false-positive rate and have a set protocol to follow in order to determine which lesions are dangerous, added Johnson.\n\nLung cancer kills 1.2 million people a year globally and it will kill 157,000 people in the United States alone this year, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nTobacco use accounts for some 85 percent of lung cancer cases in the U.S., and one estimate puts a smoker’s lifetime absolute risk of developing lung cancer between 12 percent and 17 percent. Five-year survival rates for lung cancer are low.\n\nIn recent years, CT scans, in particular, have been promoted by some hospitals and advocacy groups for lung cancer screening, even though studies had not yet shown definitively whether such screening saves lives.\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Claudia Henschke, currently based at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Arizona State University, caused a stir when she published a study concluding that 80 percent of lung-cancer deaths could be prevented through widespread use of spiral CT.\n\nHer ideas were controversial to start with, especially when other researchers found her work had been paid for by a tobacco company.\n\nIn the current study, funded in part by manufacturers of CT scanners (along with government and other sources), Henschke and her colleagues compared outcomes for nearly 8,000 smokers and former smokers who volunteered to undergo CT scans to outcomes in two sets of people with smoking histories who were not scanned.\n\nThe three groups of people had some important differences, such as in average age and how long and heavily they had smoked, so the researchers had to use mathematical tools to try to eliminate the influence of those differences, said Hanley. For instance, to compare death rates, the researchers tracked how many people died among those who were screened, then pulled out all the people with similar underlying characteristics in the other two groups and looked at their death rates, Hanley explained.\n\nA total of 64 people died in the screened population, the authors report — but applying the death rate among people with the same underlying characteristics in one of the unscreened populations, they estimated that the number of deaths would have been 100. This translates into a 36 percent lower risk of dying among the screened population.\n\nApplying the same methods to the other unscreened population, the authors estimated that screening was associated with a 64 percent lower risk of dying.\n\nOverall, research is suggesting that CT scans of people at risk of lung cancer might make a dent in cancer mortality, and it’s possible that more frequent screening might make an even bigger dent, Hanley noted. “If screening is going to work, you’ve got to keep at it.”\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/quv83r Lung Cancer, online December 17, 2010.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The meat of the story was well done, making up for the headline, lead sentence and concluding section that were a bit raw around the edges. </span>","



We were on high alert when reviewing this story about CT screening and lung cancer deaths, because of questions about the methods used in the study and the advocacy history of the lead researcher. The headline, lead sentence and concluding section… the most important sections of the story… tilt toward meek acceptance of the study claims. However, readers who take in the whole story are treated to a solid examination of many of the questions this study raises. The top and bottom of the story should have more closely reflected the meat of the report. Also, the story emphasizes the apparently large (36 to 64 percent) relative reductions in death rates without giving equal billing to the absolute reductions of less than one percent or the hundreds of smokers that would have to be screened in order to prevent one lung cancer death.

885,story_reviews_01003,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/4313/,2011-09-12 11:00:00,The Healthy Skeptic: Products make testosterone claims,"['Age is just a number. But for men, that number says a lot about what’s going on in their bodies. Starting at about age 30, men start producing less testosterone, the hormone that helps spark sex drive, build muscle and stoke energy, ambition and aggression. In short, it helps men feel manly.\n\nFor all of the talk about “male menopause,” the loss of testosterone isn’t anything like the hormonal nose dive that women go through. Instead of essentially disappearing all at once, testosterone levels usually decline by about 1% every year (although they can drop more dramatically, especially if a man becomes ill).\n\nMen diagnosed with unusually low levels of testosterone are sometimes treated with prescription testosterone injections, patches or creams. Men who want to regain the levels of their younger days without a prescription may be interested in a different route: over-the-counter products that promise to boost testosterone naturally.\n\nTestoJack 100, a supplement from NOW Foods, contains a blend of herbs, including Eleutherococcus senticosus, Tribulus terrestris and Eurycoma longifolia, along with zinc, magnesium and vitamin B-6, among other ingredients. Users are instructed to take two capsules once or twice a day. It’s available at many health-food stores, and you can expect to pay roughly $20 to $30 for a bottle of 60 capsules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHGH Up, a widely available supplement from Applied Nutriceuticals, contains, among other ingredients, the herbs Chlorophytum borivillanium, Mucuna pruriens and Huperzia serrata, along with green tea, magnesium and a vitamin B complex. Users are instructed to take five capsules every day on an empty stomach — three in the morning and two in the afternoon. A bottle of 150 capsules costs about $60.\n\nThe claims\n\nThe NOW website says TestoJack “supports male reproductive function and healthy testosterone levels.” The tribulus in the product is said to be especially helpful for “virility.” Despite the suggestive name of the product, NOW doesn’t claim that TestoJack actually increases testosterone, says Neil Levin, the company’s nutrition education manager. “It supports healthy testosterone levels,” he says.\n\nAccording to the label, HGH Up “promotes radical increases in growth hormone and testosterone production.” The website says that it can provide “the physiological benefits comparable to that of fully hormonal products while minimizing potential side effects.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough the product is marketed mainly to weightlifters and bodybuilders, it has a growing following among older men looking for rejuvenation, says Don Orrell, president of Applied Nutriceuticals. “For an older man who has low testosterone, there is absolutely no downside to taking this,” he says.\n\nOrrell notes that the way in which the product boosts testosterone is a bit of a mystery — “that’s the magic pixie dust part,” he says — but he has no doubt that it works. “The anecdotal evidence is overwhelming,” he adds.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nDr. John Morley, a testosterone expert and director of geriatrics at St. Louis University, says that there’s not a lot of scientific evidence for any supplement that claims to boost or “promote” testosterone. And for him, that’s a real problem.\n\n“These sorts of products have been around forever,” he says. “As far as I know, none of them have been proven to work in a carefully controlled trial.”\n\nSome of the individual ingredients in these products have been tested, with less-than-impressive results. In a 2007 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, Australian researchers found that giving rugby players daily doses of Tribulus terrestris for five weeks had no effect on their testosterone levels.\n\nChlorophytum, one of the ingredients in HGH Up, has long been used as a supposed aphrodisiac for men. A search of the medical literature uncovers a single study suggesting that it may have “testosterone-like” effects, including enhanced sex drive and stronger erections, but the study was conducted on rats, not humans.\n\nMorley often prescribes testosterone for men who have a significant deficit of the hormone, a condition called hypogonadism. The prevalence of this condition is controversial — it depends on how one measures testosterone and defines normal levels — but Morley estimates that 30% to 40% of middle-aged men don’t have enough testosterone to feel their best, sexually and otherwise. Even among these men, about one-third don’t respond to testosterone treatment. In other words, testosterone is hardly a sure-fire remedy against the ravages of aging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver-the-counter testosterone products may carry hidden dangers. A 2008 study in Clinical Cancer Research found that two men taking a supplement called Teston-6 developed unusually aggressive, fast-growing prostate cancer. Lab tests showed that the product contained hormones (including testosterone) that weren’t on the label, a common issue with nonprescription products. The manufacturer quickly pulled it from the market.\n\n“The problem with these sorts of supplements is that they don’t have to meet the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration,” says Dolores Lamb, a coauthor of the Teston-6 study and professor of urology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nA man who thinks he’s short on testosterone shouldn’t be looking in a health food store for answers, Morley says. “He needs to go to a doctor to get checked out.”\n\nCurious about a consumer health product?

It mostly affects boys and earned its name because, under a microscope, one arm of the X chromosome seems nearly broken, with part hanging by a thread.\n\nThe gene for fragile X was discovered in 1991. Work since then has found that fragile X patients seem to experience an overload of unchecked synaptic noise — synapses being the junctions between brain neurons. The Novartis drug and others like it are intended to lower the volume of this noise so memory formation and high-level thinking can take place, allowing children to develop normally.\n\nThe Novartis trial, which began in 2008 in Europe with data analysis completed this year, was too brief to observe effects on basic intelligence. Instead, researchers measured a range of aberrant behaviors like hyperactivity, repetitive motions, social withdrawal and inappropriate speech. They gave one set of patients the drug and another a placebo, and after a few weeks switched treatments, with both doctors and patients unaware of which pill was which.\n\nThe results of the trial were something of a jumble until Novartis scientists noticed that patients who had a particular, undisclosed biological trait improved far more than others. “The bottom line is that we showed clear improvements in behavior,” Dr. Fishman said.\n\nTold of the results, two parents of a fragile X patient were euphoric.\n\n“This is what we have been working for and hoping for since our son was diagnosed with fragile X 17 years ago,” said Katie Clapp, president and co-founder of the Fraxa Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to financing fragile X research. “This may be the key to solving the mystery of autism and other developmental disorders.”\n\nGeraldine Dawson, chief science officer at Autism Speaks, the world’s largest autism advocacy organization, said that a growing body of research suggests that the many genetic causes of autism all seem to affect synapses, suggesting that a treatment for one form of the disease might help others.\n\nPhoto\n\n“The exciting thing about these results is that it is our hope that these same medications may have similar positive benefits for people with autism who don’t have fragile X syndrome,” Dr. Dawson said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBetween 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases result from fragile X syndrome or some other known genetic defect. While fragile X is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation, Down syndrome — which also causes retardation — is more common but is not inherited.\n\nThe Novartis trial results were not published or peer reviewed, and for commercial reasons Dr. Fishman refused to divulge many details. Dr. Luca Santarelli, head of neuroscience at Roche, confirmed that Roche is in the midst of testing a similar medicine in fragile X patients at four sites in the United States.\n\n“So far we like what we see,” Dr. Santarelli said in his only characterization of their study.\n\nOne reason for the euphoria surrounding the Novartis trial is that it was seen as an especially difficult test of the drug’s effects. For ethical reasons, Novartis tested the drug only in adults. But the company and outside researchers believe that such compounds may prove most effective in young children, whose brains are far more likely to respond rapidly when barriers to learning are removed.\n\n“This is perhaps the most promising therapeutic discovery ever for a gene-based behavioral disease,” said Dr. Edward M. Scolnick, former research chief at Merck and now director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nDr. Scolnick has not seen the results of the Novartis trial, but was told of them and concluded that if the drugs work in fragile X, “there’s nothing to say that they won’t work in some cases of broader autism-spectrum disorders.”\n\nAn Unlikely Beginning\n\nThe roots for the Novartis results began in 1982 when Stephen T. Warren, then a graduate student in genetics at Michigan State University, was looking for a job and something to research. A friend told him about fragile X and, with the same reflection he might use to pick a novel for a long flight, he decided that he wanted to find the gene that caused it.\n\n“I had no idea how hard this would be,” Dr. Warren said. Nine years later, Dr. Warren, then at Emory University, was part of an international team that won a fierce competition by isolating the gene. The discovery was front-page news around the world, and experts predicted that widespread fetal testing and therapies were in the offing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And even with those, much remains mysterious.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFragile X is caused by a genetic stutter in which a portion of the gene gets repeated like a scratched album. With each subsequent generation, the number of repeats tends to rise. So if a mother has 10 repeats, her child might have 11 or 12. For reasons that are not well understood, however, this process of repeat amplification can suddenly go haywire. So mothers who have 55 or more repeats tend to have children with hundreds.\n\nIn anyone with 200 or more repeats, the body shuts off the gene. Since genes are used to make proteins, this genetic silencing means the encoded protein is never made. The absence of this protein in cells causes the wide-ranging effects of fragile X syndrome. Those with 55 to 200 repeats are considered carriers, and recent research shows they can have severe neurological declines late in life that mimic Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.\n\nMany geneticists would have moved on to other research topics after finding a disorder’s underlying gene. But Dr. Warren met affected children and their parents. Instead of family pictures, Dr. Warren’s desk displays a framed photo of a fragile X chromosome.\n\n“I could not imagine telling someone like Katie Clapp that we were not going to pursue this research anymore,” he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo he kept on. Years of work by him and others found that the protein missing in those with fragile X normally seems to act as a sort of traffic cop at brain synapses, helping to stop or slow brain signaling at crucial intervals. It does this by sopping up the genetic instructions needed to produce proteins that encourage brain signaling. Regulating this flow of electronic pulses across the brain is crucial for the brain’s ability to learn and mature.\n\nDr. Warren was puzzling over how to recreate that synaptic traffic cop when, because of a scheduling conflict, he showed up in 2001 at the wrong scientific conference and happened to sit next to Mark F. Bear, a neuroscience professor at M.I.T. who had just given a presentation about compounds that seemed to work in synapses to speed the creation of proteins — including the one missing in fragile X patients.\n\nThe two got to talking and decided to collaborate. They found that if Dr. Bear reverse-engineered his compounds, they seemed to slow brain transmissions. Instead of a traffic cop, the brain would get speed bumps. Not ideal, but perhaps adequate in lowering the synaptic noise enough to encourage learning and the moderation of the kind of synaptic traffic jams that in fragile X children can lead to seizures.\n\nSure enough, mice, fish and fruit flies that through genetic engineering were made to have fragile X seemed to become normal when given Dr. Bear’s compound. The Novartis compound is a member of the same drug family.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We have been promising for a long time that unlocking the molecular basis for hereditary diseases would lead to dramatic therapeutic advances, and that promise is finally coming true,” said Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, in discussing the science leading up to the trial. “But it has not been easy.”\n\nA Search for Treatment\n\nA hundred years ago, Katie Clapp would have died giving birth to Andy, her child with fragile X.\n\n“Andy’s head was too big to get out without a C-section, he would have killed me, and that would have taken care of the fragile X gene,” she said.\n\nBut Ms. Clapp and Andy did survive. And despite going to some of the best hospitals in the country, four years would pass before Andy’s condition was properly diagnosed.\n\nWhen a doctor finally thought to do a fragile X test, Ms. Clapp and her husband, Dr. Michael Tranfaglia — both Harvard graduates with post-graduate degrees — researched the disease and came to two conclusions: fragile X was potentially treatable; and only about five researchers in the world were working toward a cure.\n\n“And I thought, what if all five walk across the street at the same time and get hit by a Mack truck?” Ms. Clapp said. “That is not going to get us there.”\n\nSo the two started the Fraxa Research Foundation. Remarkably, their efforts seem to be paying off and may finally offer hope not only to those who with fragile X but to carriers like Andy’s sister, Laura.\n\n“I’ve always known my kids have a chance of having it,” Laura, 18, said in a recent visit to the family’s house. “But I’m not going to have kids for at least 10 years anyway, and they’ll have a cure for by then.”\n\nShe paused, looked at her mother and said: “You’ve got 10 years.”""]","We can’t believe that the New York Times based this big splash story on something ""disclosed in an interview"" with a pharma exec – from a small, unpublished trial.  And then quoted experts who also haven’t seen the data.  Disturbing. ","This report from the New York Times is a win for almost everyone. The paper gets a big scoop and a drug company gets a nice dose of front-page publicity for its experimental drug. Who loses? Anyone who think it’s important to carefully assess what happens in medical research so that good decisions can be made about treatment (i.e. the rest of us). 
We can understand why Novartis would choose to selectively disclose the results of an important study to a reporter and then have him collect comments about the ""surprising results"" from others who haven’t seen the data. Such a strategy seems likely to yield plenty of positive reactions, as this story predictably reported, while limiting opportunities for unwanted hole-poking. But we think it’s unfortunate that the Times chose to play along with Novartis’s game. In our view, an interview with a hand-picked reporter is not the appropriate venue to release the results of important new medical research, and it seems naive for the Times to pass along Novartis’s perspective on the findings without being allowed to corroborate it with other expert sources. While this drug could eventually live up to its billing as ""perhaps the most promising therapeutic discovery ever for a gene-based behavioral disease,"" as one researcher breathlessly put it, we’d prefer to at least see a study abstract before seeing these kinds of claims put down in print for all the world to base their hopes on.    
It’s unfortunate that these issues obscured some of the interesting background on fragile X and the research process, which was informative and engaging.

Dupixent is intended for patients whose eczema is not controlled adequately by topical therapies, or those for whom topical therapies are not advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids.\n\n“FDA’s approval of Dupixent demonstrates our commitment to approving new and innovative therapies for patients with skin disease,” said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Eczema can cause significant skin irritation and discomfort for patients, so it is important to have a variety of treatment options available to patients, including those patients whose disease is not controlled by topical therapies.”\n\nAtopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is often referred to as “eczema,” which is a general term for several types of inflammation of the skin. Atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczema; onset typically begins in childhood and can last through adulthood. The cause of atopic dermatitis is a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors. In atopic dermatitis, the skin develops red, scaly and crusted bumps, which are extremely itchy. Scratching leads to swelling, cracking, “weeping” clear fluid, and finally, coarsening and thickening of the skin.\n\nDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin. Dupixent’s active ingredient is an antibody (dupilumab) that binds to a protein [interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor alpha subunit (IL-4R a )], that causes inflammation. By binding to this protein, Dupixent is able to inhibit the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of atopic dermatitis.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in three placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 2,119 adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical medication(s). Overall, participants who received Dupixent achieved greater response, defined as clear or almost clear skin, and experienced a reduction in itch after 16 weeks of treatment.\n\nDupixent can cause side effects such as serious allergic reactions and eye problems, such as pink eye (conjunctivitis) and inflammation of the cornea (keratitis). If patients experience new or worsening eye symptoms such as redness, itching, pain or visual changes, they should consult a health care provider. The most common side effects include injection site reactions; cold sores in the mouth or on the lips; and eye and eyelid inflammation, including redness, swelling and itching.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Dupixent have not been established in the treatment of asthma. Patients who also have asthma should not adjust or stop their asthma treatment without talking to their physicians.\n\nThe FDA granted the application for Dupixent Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation.\n\nThe FDA granted the approval of Dupixent to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The Agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###\n\nInquiries Media: Sarah Peddicord 301-796-2805 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA\n\nRelated Information']","We don’t ding the FDA for omitting the drug’s cost since their evaluations are made independent of cost, but we do expect some hard facts on benefits.","This news release from the FDA announces the agency’s approval of a new drug, dupilumab (to be marketed as Dupixent), for treating eczema, or atopic dermatitis.

Hughes, chief executive of Zafgen, said the Boston company will use the data to prepare a “risk-mitigation” plan to help persuade the Food and Drug Administration to lift its so-called clinical hold on the late-stage trial, allowing it to resume. But he conceded that Zafgen, which had once hoped to begin selling its drug candidate, Beloranib, as early as 2016, will have to conduct at least one additional study before it can apply for FDA approval.\n\nZafgen Inc. is set Wednesday to release findings of a clinical trial showing many patients taking its experimental obesity treatment lost weight and engaged in less binge-eating, pointing to a way forward for a drug program halted by regulators last year after the deaths of two patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We’re delighted with the results,” Hughes said in an interview. “This is the first demonstration of a clinical benefit against two of the major issues that affect this patient population. Our intention is to provide a plan for moving forward with an emphasis on patient safety.”\n\nThe clinical results did not address a key issue for patients and regulators: whether Beloranib triggered the blood clotting that resulted in two patient deaths last year. Zafgen has lost more than 80 percent of its stock value since the week in October when the first death was made public.\n\nMany patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, the rare condition Beloranib treats, are prone to blood-clotting and other diseases. Hughes said Zafgen will continue to study the effect of the drug in its further trials and risk-mitigation plan, and address it in discussions with FDA officials.\n\n“As of today, we have no evidence to suggest that Beloranib by itself can cause blood clots,” Hughes said. “This is a patient population that’s at risk for thrombotic [clotting] issues.”\n\nZafgen said its six-month study involving 107 patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome met its two primary goals, known as end points: showing significant weight loss by many patients and a decrease of hyperphagia-related behavior, meaning excessive eating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the FDA’s clinical hold prevented Zafgen from completing its trial, Dennis D. Kim, the company’s chief medical officer, said it was largely finished. Sixty-eight of the enrolled patients completed the study, Kim said, while 27 other patients completed 20 of the trial’s scheduled 26 weeks. A small number of other patients withdrew early.\n\nZafgen has not identified the patients who died or said at which of 14 US trial sites they were taking the drug. Some analysts have suggested the FDA might approve the drug, despite the adverse events, if Zafgen can prove its benefits outweigh its risks to some patients.\n\nThere are currently no treatments for Prader-Willi syndrome, the most common genetic cause of life-threatening obesity. Prader-Willi affects an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Americans.\n\nIt can dominate the lives of patients and their families, leading to excessive overeating, choking, and stomach rupture, along with slowed metabolism and psychiatric disorders.\n\nAverage life expectancy of Prader-Willi syndrome patients is 32 years.\n\n“The efficacy of Beloranib looks very promising,” said Dr. Merlin G. Butler, director of research and genetics at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan., and a principal investigator for the clinical trial there. “We’ve seen individuals who have lost significant amounts of weight in the six-month period. We think the drug must at least diminish the food-seeking drive, which correlates to an increased caloric intake in patients.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZafgen, founded in 2005, is backed by investors that include venture capital firms Atlas Venture of Cambridge and Third Rock Ventures of Boston. The company raised $96 million in an initial public offering in 2014, using the money to finance its clinical studies.\n\nShares of Zafgen, which traded as high as $55.36 on the Nasdaq stock exchange last year, closed Tuesday at $5.62, down nearly 3.3 percent for the day.\n\nRobert Weisman can be reached at robert.weisman@globe.com.

She had also been taking the corticosteroid prednisone for two decades.\n\nExperts have already noticed an uptick in the incidence of this rare but devastating condition in patients using bisphosphonates.\n\nAccording to an editorial accompanying the study, this complication occurs in about 5 percent of cancer patients who are taking a high-dose bisphosphonate (Zometa or Aredia) to control or prevent spread of malignancy to the bone. It is much rarer in people who take a lower-dose bisphosphonate (such as Actonel, Boniva or Fosamax) for osteoporosis.\n\nThe 88-year-old woman described in the journal report had been experiencing pain in her jaw for a year and was subsequently diagnosed with osteonecrosis, a debilitating ""death"" of bone due to loss of blood flow.\n\nAfter eight weeks of treatment with Forteo, though, the pain went away and the osteonecrosis resolved, reported the authors, from Austin Health in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThe editorial pointed out, however, that Forteo should not be used in patients whose cancer has already spread to the bone, as it might prompt even more spread.\n\nIt\'s also possible that the corticosteroid therapy she was taking could have contributed to the woman\'s bone loss, the authors stated.\n\nThe second paper involved 40 patients with severe gum disease that had affected their jaws, all of whom first underwent surgery on their jaw.

To survive with very little sunlight, they have evolved to convert light into energy with incredible efficiency, Emberton’s team said in a study published in the journal Lancet Oncology.\n\nThe Weizmann scientists exploited this feature to develop WST11, a compound that releases free radicals to kill surrounding cells when activated by laser light.\n\nMen with low-risk prostate cancer are currently put under active surveillance, where the disease is monitored and only treated when it becomes more severe. Radical therapy, which involves surgically removing or irradiating the whole prostate, has significant long-term side effects so is only used to treat high-risk cancers.\n\nWhile radical therapy causes lifelong erectile problems and incontinence, VTP only caused short-term urinary and erectile problems which resolved within three months, the researchers said. No significant side-effects remained after two years.\n\nIn the trial, only 6 percent of patients treated with VTP needed radical therapy compared with 30 percent of patients in the control arm who were under active surveillance.\n\nThe trial involved 47 treatment sites in 10 European countries, most of which were performing VTP for the first time.\n\n“The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centers in various health systems is really remarkable,” Emberton said.\n\nThe VTP treatment is now being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for possible license, but it likely to be several years before it can be offered to patients more widely.']",News outlets that run PR pieces and call them news stories undermine the credibility of health journalism and erode the ability of real health reporting to advance public dialogue.,"This story is a rehash of a misleading University College London news release that reported results of a phase 3 trial of a cancer treatment called vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP), which involves injecting a light-sensitive drug into the bloodstream and then activating it with a laser to attack tumor tissue.
We also reviewed the news release. The story reported some quantified benefits and harms that were mentioned in the news release. But this coverage does not explain the full extent of quantified benefits and harms, offers no discussion of study limitations or the potential cost of this treatment, and falsely conveys that low-risk prostate cancer requires prompt treatment. There are no independent sources and no mention that the trial was funded by the biotech company that developed the treatment.

So many reports of potential tests for Alzheimer’s Disease have been announced recently that one might wonder what exactly is newsworthy about yet another announcement of a small study proclaiming preliminary results, particularly when the source is the founder of the company developing this test. This story about a blood test for antibodies that appear to be associated with Alzheimer’s meets almost all our specific criteria, but it would have been a better story if instead of merely announcing a “New Blood Test for Alzheimer’s” it had led with what distinguishes this potential test from others in development.
The real challenge of diagnostic tests for a condition like Alzheimer’s is that you want a very specific test. That means that if we say you’re going to develop Alzheimer’s, you will. Though the story reports that the test correctly identified 92 out of 100 patients who didn’t have Alzheimers, what you really want to know is whether a person who tests positive or negative today is going to develop Alzheimers in the next 1, 2 or more years. The study didn’t do this and that’s the key problem with the study and the reporting of these very preliminary results.

He was hospitalized 14 times in 2009, always to have fluid drained from his lungs so he could breathe. He went on the heart transplant waiting list two months ago.\n\nMonday\'s implantation marked the beginning of Torre\'s Phase 1 clinical trial of the therapy, the first time what is known as neurostimulation has been used to treat heart failure.\n\nThere is considerable data showing connections between the brain, nervous system and heart, said Torre, but until now, no one has attempted to take advantage of the relationship therapeutically.\n\nPrognosis is grave\n\nIf the experiment proves successful, it would provide an entirely different approach to heart failure, a chronic, progressive disease that affects nearly 6 million Americans.\n\nCharacterized by the heart\'s inability to supply sufficient blood flow to meet the body\'s needs, heart failure can lead to shortness of breath, fluid and retention, lung congestion and rapid or irregular heartbeats. It is usually ultimately fatal.\n\nThe condition is currently treated by oral medications, almost all of which lower blood pressure. A typical heart failure patient is on seven such drugs, which Torre characterized as ""the limit."" Because new drugs can only be tested on top of existing therapy, introducing potentially better drugs is difficult.\n\nNeurostimulation works by sending low-intensity electrical impulses to targeted portions of the spinal cord.\n\nThe hope is that such stimulation will modulate nervous system responses, such as toning down the release of hormones that typically occur at times of stress and increasing the flow of blood.\n\n20-patient study\n\nThe study calls for Torre to implant the system, done through small puncture holes in the lower back, in 20 patients with advanced heart failure, then conducting tests on them after one, two and three months to measure heart function.\n\nTorre said though patients may feel some euphoria in the early days, it likely will take about a month before doctors have a good idea whether the therapy is working.\n\nThe therapy passed a first test Monday evening as doctors adjusted the electrical impulse level to Bardwell\'s satisfaction.\n\n""It\'s really mild,"" said Bardwell.

""I don\'t know that all these people could be saved with PSA testing,"" but many could, he added.\n\nThe report was published online July 30 in the journal Cancer.\n\nMessing said the annual number of prostate cancer deaths dropped from about 42,000 in the 1990s to 28,000 now. ""The only thing that can explain that is PSA early detection and treatment,"" he said.\n\nMany cases of prostate cancer are not life-threatening, which is why testing is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in May recommended against routine PSA screening, saying too many non-lethal cancers were being treated aggressively, exposing men who didn\'t need treatment to serious side effects such as impotence and urinary incontinence.\n\nBut Messing disagreed with that advice. Condemning PSA testing ""wasn\'t a brilliant conclusion,"" he said.\n\nFor the new study, Messing\'s team compared information from the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for the years 1983 to 1985 -- immediately before widespread PSA testing started --- to data from 2006 through 2008.\n\nIn the 2008 data, 8,000 cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed after the malignancy had spread to other parts of the body.\n\nUsing these cases as a base, the researchers constructed a model that used data of advanced cancer diagnosed in the 1980s and predicted how many cases of advanced cancer would have been diagnosed in 2008 if PSA testing was not done.\n\nTheir model showed instead of 8,000 actual cases in 2008, about 25,000 cases would have been diagnosed.\n\nBut the USPSTF maintains the benefits of testing are overrated. ""The task force recommends against prostate cancer screening using the PSA test, as the potential benefit does not outweigh the harms,"" said Dr. Michael LeFevre, co-vice chair of the task force and professor in the department of family and community medicine at the University of Missouri School of Medicine.\n\nAs a result of treatments for PSA-detected prostate cancer, one out of 1,000 men screened in the United States develops a blood clot in his legs or lungs, two will have a heart attack or stroke, and up to 40 are left impotent or with urinary incontinence, LeFevre said.\n\n""At best, only one of these 1,000 men who were screened avoids dying from prostate cancer for at least 10 years,"" LeFevre said. ""In addition, about one in every 3,000 men screened dies as a result of surgery to treat cancer detected by the PSA test.""\n\nStill, the task force recognizes that ""some men may continue requesting the PSA test and some physicians may continue offering it,"" LeFevre said.\n\nBefore getting this blood test -- which measures a protein in cells of the prostate gland -- men should learn about the pros and cons, he said. ""The decision to start or continue screening should reflect an understanding of the possible benefits and known harms, and should respect each individual\'s preferences.""\n\nMessing advises men with a family history of prostate cancer or urinary symptoms to have a PSA test. Men with no family history or symptoms should discuss PSA testing with their doctor, he added.\n\nMessing pointed out that screening-detected cancer doesn\'t mean surgery, chemotherapy or radiation treatment must follow. Most cases can be watched for some time, he said.\n\nDr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said over the past few years a number of studies have been published on the benefits and harms of PSA testing.\n\n""None of these studies can be considered decisive other than in proving that there are some harms associated with treatment,"" he said. The American Cancer Society still supports screening for certain men in consultation with a physician.\n\nProstate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. In 2012, more than 240,000 new cases are expected to be diagnosed, and 28,000 men will die from the disease, researchers say.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']",We’re told that researchers constructed a model – but there is no critical evaluation of that model.,"HealthDay’s story didn’t make an attempt to critically evaluate the statistical modeling study as WebMD and TIME.com did.  This is a critical flaw in such a story.

""Anti-reflux surgery should be considered in patients who do not achieve complete control of their symptoms [regurgitation or cough] with medications; who do not want to take medications for the rest of their lives; or who experience complications of medical therapy.""\n\n\n\nFor the study, researchers analyzed data in the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database of more than 75,000 adults who underwent either laparoscopic or open fundoplication for GERD between 2000 and 2013. NIS represents 1,000 U.S. hospitals and contains data on more than seven million hospitalizations each year. During the study period, 58.4 percent of patients underwent laparoscopic procedures and 41.6 percent had open anti-reflux operations performed through a long abdominal incision.\n\n\n\nThe study showed that the rate of laparoscopic procedures increased from 24.8 percent in 2000 to 84.3 percent in 2013. ""Surprisingly, in 2003, 12 years after the first laparoscopic anti-reflux operation was reported, only 25 percent of all the anti-reflux operations were performed laparoscopically in the U.S.,"" Dr. Schlottmann said. ""Subsequently, the rate increased, but 15 percent of all anti-reflux operations were still being performed through an open approach in 2013. We believe this percentage is very high, and we hope that in the next year this percentage will decrease.""\n\n\n\nAlong with discovering that the use of laparoscopy for the surgical treatment of GERD has increased significantly in the last decade, the researchers also found that, on average, the minimally invasive approach reduced length of hospital stay by approximately two days, and open operations were more than $9,000 more expensive than minimally invasive procedures.\n\n\n\nThe researchers also found that laparoscopic procedures were better for patients in terms of fewer complications. Laparoscopic anti-reflux operations were less likely to result in postoperative blood clots, wound complications, surgical site infection, esophageal perforation (which can be life threatening), bleeding, cardiac failure, and death.\n\n\n\n""Our study highlights the fact that laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is as effective as the open approach, and in 2017, with all its advantages, should be the standard of care,"" said senior study author Marco G. Patti, MD, FACS, a surgeon and Director of the Center for Esophageal Diseases and Swallowing, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\n\n\n""We found that laparoscopic surgery is associated with significantly lower costs. In addition, indirect costs of the open approach, including an impaired ability to work, time off from work, and intangible costs of postoperative pain and healing, are difficult to measure but also favor the laparoscopic approach,"" said Dr. Patti.\n\n\n\n""GERD is a common digestive disorder that can usually be treated with dietary changes and medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, chronic and not-controlled GERD can cause serious complications. Repeated exposure to stomach acid can damage the lining of the esophagus and lead to a precancerous condition called Barrett\'s esophagus,"" said Dr. Schlottmann.\n\n\n\nStudy results also revealed that urban academic or teaching hospitals performed laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery at a higher rate than open procedures, 54.4 percent versus 45.6 percent. ""We think that it is important to make this information more available to the public. In order to achieve good outcomes, anti-reflux surgery should be performed laparoscopically in specialized centers,"" said Dr. Patti.\n\n\n\n###\n\nPaula D Strassle, MSPH Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC also participated in this study.\n\n\n\nCitation: Comparative Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes and Costs Between Laparoscopic and Open Antireflux Surgery.

One of the best studies the panel found focused on healthy women over age 65 and concluded that screenings spaced eight years or less apart did not make much of a difference in identifying which women would be more at risk for fractures.\n\nThe report identified possible benefits of screening, but noted that there is no solid evidence — in the form of randomized trials, medicine’s gold standard — comparing fracture rates of patients who have been screened with those who have not been screened.\n\nBut the panel is in the process of updating its recommendations, which were issued in 2002. A preliminary report in July packed a surprise: No direct evidence was found that testing patients for low bone density helped avoid broken bones. “It’s still amazing to me,’’ said the report’s lead author, Dr. Heidi Nelson, a professor at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\nThe task force offers no advice for women younger than 60 or for men of any age, though men account for at least 20 percent of US patients with osteoporosis.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force, which sets standards on disease prevention and primary care, suggests that all women get a bone density screening by age 65, or by 60 if a patient might be at high risk for fractures. Risk factors include being female, having a family history of osteoporosis or broken bones, being small and thin, and having low levels of sex hormones, in addition to older age.\n\nOne of the first dilemmas patients typically encounter is when to get screened for osteoporosis, and then how often to repeat the test — a painless body scan that measures bone density.\n\n“What is right in 2010,’’ she said, “might not be right in 2011 in a rapidly evolving medical science.’’\n\nDr. Felicia Cosman, clinical director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation and a professor at Columbia University, said the swirl of new information makes it critical for patients to review with their physicians their treatment decisions.\n\nEven the issues of how much vitamin D adults should take and whether calcium supplements help keep bones strong have been matters of debate.\n\nThe safety of one of the most popular types of medication used to lessen the risk of fractures — bisphosphonates, such as Fosamax and Boniva — has also been questioned.\n\nOver the past several months, studies have raised questions about the effectiveness of screening for osteoporosis, a silent disease that weakens the bones of an estimated 10 million Americans, most over age 50.\n\nSorting through all the recent news about osteoporosis, or low bone density, can be dizzying.\n\nA task force of specialists appointed by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research reported last month that long-term use of bisphosphonates, typically beyond five years, may increase a patient’s risk of an unusual but serious type of thigh fracture. The panel reviewed 310 such cases and concluded that they represent less than one-half of 1 percent of all American patients taking bisphosphonates. However the panel also said it believed the number of such fractures is under-reported.\n\nThere is little dispute over the conclusion of several studies that bisphosphonates can be effective in lowering patients’ risk of fractures, some by as much as 50 percent. But in recent months, questions have grown about their safety.\n\nBisphosphonates — the class of drugs that includes Fosamax, Boniva, and others — were approved by federal regulators in 1995 and have since been prescribed for millions of patients. Taken orally or by injection, the drugs work by slowing the growth of cells that break down bones, giving the edge to other cells that rebuild them.\n\nWhen it comes to the most popular type of osteoporosis treatment, bisphosphonates, the question is not so much about how much to take, but whether there are harmful consequences from long-term use.\n\nAn updated report on recommended levels for both nutrients is due next month from the Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences, which advises the federal government.\n\nThere are fewer differences of opinion among health professionals about calcium levels, with most recommending about 1,200 daily milligrams for adults over 50. However, the most extensive study on the calcium question, done by the Women’s Health Initiative as a randomized controlled trial, was inconclusive. It found no significant reduction in fractures in the study population, which received supplements of 1,000 milligrams of calcium and 400 international units of vitamin D daily.\n\nBeyond the screening question, many physicians routinely ask patients about their calcium and vitamin D intake. The federal government recommends just 400 international units daily of vitamin D for adults over age 50, while the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends 800 to 1,000 units. Some doctors suggest doubling those higher amounts for post-menopausal women.\n\nWaiting until women are in their 60s to scan will result in missing many who could be diagnosed and treated, she said. “The reason you want to find people at the time of menopause is because there is acceleration [of bone loss] at this time,’’ Cosman said. This is when estrogen plummets, and estrogen helps protect bone health.\n\n“I believe all women should have a bone screening test approximately at the time of menopause,’’ said Cosman, emphasizing that “this is my personal opinion as a specialist who treats women,’’ and not representative of her position with the National Osteoporosis Foundation.\n\nIn the absence of clear guidelines, many physicians make their own judgment calls.\n\n“The thigh is one of the strongest bones in the body and it’s unusual for it to break,’’ said Columbia University professor Dr. Elizabeth Shane, the task force cochair and a specialist who has prescribed the medications to many of her osteoporosis patients.\n\n“It’s pretty hard to prove causality, but we found a pretty clear link,’’ Shane said.\n\nHer task force recommended that an international registry be created for tracking such cases to help researchers better pinpoint which patients might be at risk. It also called on the US Food and Drug Administration to change medication labeling to alert physicians and patients to the possibility of these unusual fractures, and to urge awareness of possible warning signs: prolonged groin or thigh pain.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA said it is reviewing the data and is considering changing the labeling on bisphosphonates. It also recommended that patients report groin or thigh pain to their physicians, but did not suggest they stop taking the medications unless ordered to do so by their doctors.\n\nQuestions also persist about the potential link between the medications and cancer of the esophagus.\n\nIn August, a team of researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association that bisphosphonate use was not linked to an increased risk of stomach or esophageal cancer. The scientists reviewed about 80,000 patient records from a 6 million-person database in Britain.\n\nBut in September, a different group of scientists used the same database and concluded in an article in the British Medical Journal that bisphosphonates appeared to double the risk of esophageal cancer after about 5 years of use. Still, this group stressed the risk was very small, resulting in 2 cases of throat cancer in 1,000 people ages 60 to 79, compared with the normal rate of 1 per 1,000.\n\nSome doctors are giving their patients “drug holidays’’ in which they take them off the prescriptions for a while.\n\nThe question is, for how long?\n\n“Nobody really knows,’’ said Shane, the Columbia University professor. “Every patient has to be evaluated on a case by case basis.’’\n\nPhysicians face a tough choice when it comes to frail patients who have brittle bones. If they pull them off the medications because of the possible risk of serious side effects with longer-term use, there is little else to prescribe.\n\nFor Dr. Douglas C. Bauer, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco and a researcher who also treats many osteoporosis patients, the hardest decision is when to stop the drugs in patients who still have low bone density after five years of treatment but are not especially frail.\n\n“It was appropriate to treat them to begin with, but you are not clear on added benefit for prolonged use beyond five years,’’ he said. “So I ask them, ‘What would you like to do?’ And I explain the data and say it’s a gray area, and I say we can decide together.’’\n\nKay Lazar can be reached at klazar@globe.com.\n\n© Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.']","Superb job of identifying major uncertainties surrounding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis. In doing so, it cut through the fog of misinformation—some would say “hype”—that often surrounds this topic."," 
The scientific evidence in this area seems to be changing by the month—and those at potential risk of fractures need to stay informed about key developments. The Boston Globe article clearly gave women and men enough information to at least start a discussion with their doctors about these issues.
Many news stories on osteoporosis simply parrot the opinions of experts and present them as the last word on the subject. This article avoided that trap, clearly distinguishing the proven from uNPRoven, and opinion from fact.
It accurately observed that there is no conclusive evidence regarding the indications for, and the timing of, bone density screening. It hammered home the key point that rigorous scientific trials have not yet proven that screening prevents fractures.
The article identified the substantial uncertainties regarding the use of both calcium and vitamin D in the prevention of osteoporosis. It discussed the potential of hugely popular medications such as Fosamax and Boniva to prevent fractures—as well as to cause serious side effects such as cancer of the esophagus and pathological fractures of the thigh bone.
It there is a shortcoming in this article, it might be the way it presents medical decision-making in this area. At a couple of junctures, the story came close to endorsing traditional “doctor knows best” paternalistic decision-making.
 “In the absence of clear guidelines, many physicians make their own judgment calls,” the story suggested at one point. “Physicians face a tough choice when it comes to frail patient with brittle bones,” the story speculated at another.  Yet in medical encounters it is (or should be) the patient who is the ultimate decision-maker.
Only in the last paragraph did the article acknowledge the modern paradigm of shared decision-making, where informed patients make therapeutic decisions based on their values, goals and tolerance for risk.
In areas of medical uncertainty, it is the role of the healthcare provider to help patients make the right decision—not to dictate the therapeutic approach.

They\'re developing a new treatment strategy that could someday help heal a damaged tooth using the patient\'s own stem cells.\n\nThough the work is still in its early stages, and has not yet been tested in people, the scientists won an award from the Royal Society of Chemistry for their idea: regenerative dental fillings.\n\nWhen dental pulp disease and injury happen, a root canal is typically performed to remove the infected tissues, explained Dr. Adam Celiz, Marie Curie Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham.\n\nInstead of the current dental materials used on fillings, which are toxic to cells, the new approach harnesses stem cells instead.\n\n""What we found is a material that can potentially regenerate components of a patients\' tooth,"" Celiz told CBS News.\n\n""We\'re trying to provide an alternative material, an alternative therapy,"" he said, because the current method involves the dentist removing all of the infected pulp tissue, ""scraping it out, and it can be very painful.""\n\nThe process works by stimulating native stem cells inside teeth, triggering repair and regeneration of pulp tissues.\n\n""We hope to eventually encourage dentin regeneration. Dentin is the protective layer that sits on top of the pulp tissue. It\'s a barrier between enamel and the soft tissue that contains all the blood vessels and cells,"" Celiz explained.\n\nCBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook put it in simple terms: ""The cells in the area of a root canal, in the pulp, those are normally asleep. It\'s like this material goes over and just taps it on the shoulder and says, \'Wake up, wake up,\' and then it starts to repair itself.""\n\nThe stem cell procedure is in the earliest stages of development, said Celiz.\n\n""We have tested it in cell cultures and we\'re moving it along into rodents,"" he said. ""It\'s hard to put timeline on it, but we\'re talking years before we test it in humans.""\n\n""We\'re hoping this approach can bring regenerative medicine into the dentistry field,"" said Celiz.\n\nIf successful, a treatment like this could someday offer significant benefits for millions of dental patients each year.']","When there are no direct clinical benefits to quantify about a possible new medical intervention, it’s a sign the research may be too preliminary for a wide audience.","This story emanates from a research award given to researchers at the University of Nottingham by the UK-based Royal Society of Chemistry to study the use of native stem cells to repair dental tissue. It says stem cells could allow patients to regrow decayed material inside their teeth: “Instead of the current dental materials used on fillings, which are toxic to cells, the new approach harnesses stem cells instead.”
The story makes clear that this idea is far from being tested on humans but strays into the realm of stem cell hype by asserting that it might someday offer “significant benefits” to millions of patients and even “put an end to root canals.” This material, according to the researchers, has been studied in cell culture and is about to be studied in rodents.
Suggesting at this point that it might offer any benefits is a stretch at best and suggesting that its use in repair of dental caries could “put an end to root canals” is absurd.  The story inflates the benefits, ignores the risks and provides no counterbalance by experts in the field.

That includes more than three million Americans, only half of whom are aware they have the disease, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation.\n\nCoffee, or caffeine in general have previously been linked to increased glaucoma risk, although recent studies don’t agree, Coleman and her colleagues write.\n\nTo evaluate the relationship between specific caffeinated drinks and glaucoma, Coleman and colleagues analyzed data on a sample of more than 10,000 people in the U.S. who were representative of the entire population. Participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2005-2006 answered questions about their diets and lifestyles, had medical exams and blood tests and also underwent eye examinations.\n\nAbout 1,700 participants were over age 40, had no other known eye diseases and had full eye examination results from the survey. In this group, Coleman’s team found that just over 5 percent, 82 people, had glaucoma.\n\nAlmost half of participants reported drinking coffee often, but less than 10 percent drank hot tea daily. The research team found no associations between coffee, iced tea, decaffeinated tea or soft drink consumption and the likelihood of having glaucoma.\n\n“Tea drinkers should keep drinking and don’t need to stop because of a fear of glaucoma,” Coleman said. “This makes sense, but we’ll see if it holds up in future studies.”\n\nFuture studies should look at the habits, activities and nutrition that affect lifestyle and glaucoma risks, said Idan Hecht of Tel-Aviv University in Israel, who wasn’t involved in the research.\n\n“In the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in interest, and subsequently research, into the ways lifestyle changes can influence diseases,” Hecht told Reuters Health by email.\n\nRecent research indicates that vitamins C, E and zinc can help vision. Other studies indicate that antioxidants in tea could have similar effects, he noted.\n\n“Patients can and should be involved and take an active role in the management of their ailments,” Hecht said. “Exercising, eating healthy and trying novel ways to improve your health is something you should definitely explore and bring up with your physician.”\n\nEnvironmental factors could play a role in glaucoma risk as well, said Dr. Ahmad Aref at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\n“As our population grows older, we need to think about the other factors that could help, particularly when it comes to the health benefits of physical activity,” he told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nOverall, both medical and non-medical approaches are key to treating the disease in the future, Aref added.\n\n“It’s a tough disease because we don’t have a way to bring vision back once it’s lost,” he said. “All we can do is prevent it from getting worse, and we want to help patients do that.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2Bszp7c British Journal of Ophthalmology, online December 14, 2017.']","But the story had several independent sources, and did a good job describing the study’s design.","Getty Images

Hopeful New Signs Of Relief For Migraine Sufferers,"['Gone With A Shot? Hopeful New Signs Of Relief For Migraine Sufferers\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Photographer is my life/Getty Images Photographer is my life/Getty Images\n\nHumans have suffered from migraines for millennia. Yet, despite decades of research, there isn\'t a drug on the market today that prevents them by targeting the underlying cause. All of that could change in a few months when the Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce its decision about new therapies that have the potential to turn migraine treatment on its head.\n\nThe new therapies are based on research begun in the 1980s showing that people in the throes of a migraine attack have high levels of a protein called calcitonin gene–related peptide, or CGRP, in their blood.\n\nStep by step, researchers tracked and studied this neurochemical\'s effects. They found that injecting the peptide into the blood of people prone to migraines triggers migraine-like headaches, whereas people not prone to migraines experienced, at most, mild pain. Blocking transmission of CGRP in mice appeared to prevent migraine-like symptoms. And so a few companies started developing a pill that might do the same in humans.\n\nClinical trials of the first pills were effective against migraine but halted in 2011 over concerns about potential liver damage. So, four pharmaceutical companies rejiggered their approach. To bypass the liver, all four instead looked to an injectable therapy called monoclonal antibodies — tiny immune molecules most commonly used to treat cancer. Not only do these bypass the liver to block CGRP, but one injection appears to be effective for up to three months with almost no noticeable side effects.\n\nTwo manufacturers, Amgen (in collaboration with Novartis) and Teva Pharmaceuticals, have completed clinical trials and expect to hear from the FDA by June whether the therapies have been approved. Two more companies, Eli Lilly and Alder Biopharmaceuticals, plan to file for FDA approval later this year.\n\nCurrent treatments don\'t always work\n\nIt\'s been a long time coming. Right now, the only available preventive treatments are accidental discoveries: A number of people prescribed medications for depression, high blood pressure and epilepsy discovered migraine relief, too. Now, many of those drugs, including propranolol and topiramate, have been tested and approved for migraine. But no one drug works for everyone, and side effects can prove intolerable or downright unpleasant.\n\nMigraines are throbbing, one-sided headaches that can be accompanied by nausea as well as sensitivity to light, sound, smell, and movement. At their best, the headaches are an annoyance. At their worst, they can be completely debilitating. So for those of us who get numerous migraines each month, the prospect of a new approach feels almost life-changing.\n\nAccording to one recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women in the U.S. reported having had a migraine in the last three months. And up to 2 percent of all Americans has at least 15 migraine days every single month. The toll such pain can take on health, morale, and productivity is substantial.\n\nMy own migraines started when I was 13. They struck a few times a week and I thought they were normal headaches. For a while, I tried the usual over the counter pain relievers but, one by one, they stopped working. By age 25, I started to wonder if there was something seriously wrong with my head. My general practitioner diagnosed me with migraines, gave me my first preventive medication — an antidepressant — then sent me to see a specialist.\n\nSince that day more than 17 years ago, I have tried six preventive prescription medications. Not one helped. I alternated among four different, neurologist-recommended supplements, all to no avail. I received bi-monthly injections of magnesium and participated in one of the first clinical trials of Botox. And while Botox seemed to decrease my migraines by one or two per month, it wasn\'t enough to bother fighting about it with a new insurance company. I exercised regularly. I experimented with an elimination diet that left me eating nothing but broccoli and white rice, but still the migraines came. I averaged about 15 to 20 each month.\n\nStill, I considered myself lucky. The headaches almost never came with nausea, and I had medications that typically ousted them within an hour or two. All told, I usually lost only a few hours of productivity a week.\n\nWhen I grew older and had two children, my body changed and my migraines changed, too. I get them less frequently now, but when they come, they can stick around for a few days or even a week. Abortive medications still work, except when they don\'t. So when I heard about a new approach that was making its way through a number of pharmaceutical company pipelines, I began combing through the national clinical trials database to find a trial near me. I found one about 80 miles away, which didn\'t seem too far a trek considering the tantalizing reward of a migraine-free life. I made an appointment.\n\nClinical trials seem promising\n\nNeurologist David Dodick, at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, has been involved in multiple clinical trials with each of the four anti-CGRP antibody treatments in development. And, he admits, he\'s optimistic. He has good reason to be: Each of the therapies decreases migraine frequency by at least one to two days per month. ""In a field where, over time, the progress and pace of research in understanding the underlying biology and mechanism of disease has been slow, this was very exciting,"" he says.\n\nBecause migraines are not life-threatening, most drugs have to pass a pretty high bar to be approved. And so far, patients on the experimental treatments report limited side effects that consist mostly of pain at the injection site. Unlike the current preventive medications, there is no nausea, no fuzzy thinking, no nerve pain, no weight loss or gain. And instead of remembering to take a daily pill, there is just a once-monthly injection.\n\nNeurologists already have patients eager to test these therapies, especially when everything else they\'ve tried hasn\'t worked. ""There\'s a big hole to fill, both in prevention and acute therapies,"" says Alexander Mauskop, director of the New York Headache Center in New York City. (Disclosure: He\'s my former neurologist.) ""If I have someone who\'s really suffering and can\'t find a solution, I tell them that in June I might have something new for them to try."" Right now, he says, he has a list of about two dozen such patients.\n\nHigh price tag\n\nEven if the new therapies are approved, however, patients may still have to jump through a number of hoops to get them. Biologic therapies like these are expensive, and treatment could reportedly range anywhere from $8,000 to $18,000 a year. At that price, Mauskop and other neurologists expect insurance companies to require patients to have tried just about everything else first.\n\nThe other hitch at this stage is a lack of long-term safety data. ""If someone is well-controlled with Botox or another drug, I\'d not suggest they switch,"" Mauskop says. ""With Vioxx, it took 10 years before they discovered that it increased the risk of heart problems.""\n\nSide effects are a potential concern. Elizabeth Loder, chief of headache at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston, points out that because CGRP constricts blood vessels, there may be potential long-term effects on blood pressure or other cardiovascular function. In women of childbearing age, who are the ones most prone to frequent migraines, ""you can imagine that might have effects on fertility or placental function.""\n\nRight now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.\n\nI ask Mauskop whether he\'d recommend I enroll in a clinical trial, given my failure to respond to most everything else. He pauses, noting that he\'s no longer my neurologist and that he can\'t really give me any suggestions. But then he says that, since I\'d previously shown some response to Botox, perhaps I might want to give it another try. I think about my two young children and my risk tolerance. Perhaps in 10 years I\'ll feel differently. For now, however, I pick up the phone and cancel my clinical trial appointment.\n\nLauren Gravitz is a science writer and editor in Hershey, Penn.

There, they received a coupon for the latest in fertility management: a genetic test marketed as a way to help maximize their chances of becoming pregnant.\n\nThe hitch: Top reproductive endocrinologists point out that there’s no evidence the $950 DNA test can actually help women conceive. And even the company’s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can’t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they’re struggling with infertility.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Fertilome test hit the market at the start of this year and the company behind it, Celmatix, said more than 50 doctors have already ordered it for hundreds of women seeking scientific guidance on questions such as whether they should freeze their eggs for future use, or whether it’s worth it to try another round of in vitro fertilization. The Celmatix CEO, Piraye Yurttas Beim, said her team has heard of a small wave of “Fertilome babies” on the way.\n\nSome reproductive specialists are enthusiastic. But others caution that Fertilome is just the latest genetic test promising more than it can deliver — and, in this case, playing to the fears of women who are anxious about becoming a mother. (Another example: a new $89 test that claims to tell women how their DNA could influence the level of a beneficial fatty acid in their breast milk.)\n\nThe Fertilome test, which must be ordered by a doctor, analyzes a woman’s DNA for 49 genetic variants that have been linked to various conditions that can sometimes cause fertility problems. A couple weeks later, the doctor gets back a long report listing the odds that a patient has certain conditions.\n\nFor example, she might be 4.4 times more likely than women without a particular genetic variant to have a condition known as primary ovarian insufficiency, characterized by irregular periods and diminished fertility before age 40.\n\nThat sounds alarming, and might prompt a younger woman who’s planning to delay pregnancy to freeze her eggs to be sure she has them available down the road. But the report does not explain that the condition is fairly rare — affecting just 1 in 1,000 women by age 30 and 1 in 250 women by age 35 — so the absolute risk is still very small.\n\nThe $950 Fertilome test must be ordered by a doctor and requires women to get their blood drawn. Celmatix\n\nAnd just because women have an elevated genetic risk for a condition doesn’t mean they actually have it.\n\nMany of the other conditions that the test screens for are also quite rare. But the report doesn’t explain the prevalence.\n\nSo a patient may see a table showing that her genetic variants make her twice as likely to have a condition known as recurrent pregnancy loss, defined as repeated miscarriages. But the report doesn’t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. The doctor ordering the test, or a genetic counselor, is supposed to provide that information.\n\nWithout the proper context, “some of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients,” said Dr. John Petrozza, chief of the division of reproductive medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nPetrozza said he worries that women might wrongly interpret a long litany of genetic risks to mean that their hopes to start a family are “doomed.” He also said he sees the test as “very costly for what it’s trying to do — and not really giving, at least at this point, what I would consider meaningful information.”\n\nTapping into women’s anxieties\n\nThe Fertilome test was eight years in the making. It draws on more than 5,000 studies that have found associations between particular genetic variants and conditions that can cause fertility problems, company spokeswoman Colleen McMillen said.\n\nBeim, the Celmatix CEO, said the test is already bringing “tremendous” value, in part by providing guidance that can act as a “tiebreaker” to help patients and their doctor decide which treatment to prioritize.\n\n“It will help save a lot of heartache and time if we could know from the very beginning that [a given patient] is at risk for a uterine factor, or if it’s more her eggs,” said Dr. Angie Beltsos, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in Chicago who ordered the Fertilome test for one of her patients for the first time last month.\n\nWhat the test can’t do: provide evidence-backed answers on what patients should try next. Nor can it tell patients whether they’re wired to get pregnant from IVF — or wired to fail it. “We’re not there. We’re not claiming we’re there,” Beim said.\n\nBeim trained as a molecular genetics researcher. As a Ph.D. student at Weill Cornell in the 2000s, she worked on an early project in what’s now called precision medicine: identifying the specific genetic alterations in the tumors of lung cancer patients that seemed to predict whether they would respond to a certain drug.\n\nAfter shifting her research focus to embryology, Beim found herself frustrated that the fertility field wasn’t benefiting from the same boom in translational genetics that was reshaping oncology. So she started her own company.\n\nCelmatix also sells software, called Polaris, that pulls from the medical histories of hundreds of thousands of women to try to predict which fertility treatments are likely to work in different circumstances.\n\n“Some of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients.” Dr. John Petrozza, fertility specialist\n\nFertilome — not to be confused with a line of weed killers and other gardening products with the same name — launched in January with a $1,900 price tag. Insurers don’t cover it; after it became clear that patients were balking at the bill, Celmatix cut the price in half.\n\nCelmatix is mostly marketing the test to reproductive specialists, who are largely using it in the toughest infertility cases, Beim said.\n\nBut the company is also beginning to market directly to women — including younger women who aren’t trying to get pregnant yet.\n\nThe company has recently started promoting social media ads, like one that asks: “Are you getting the right fertility treatments for your DNA?” Another asserts: “Over 60% of millennial women are open to #eggfreezing. The Fertilome test can help you decide if it is right for you.”\n\nThe company’s website also features testimonials from women who say they have used Fertilome to help guide their decisions. There’s Ella, a 30-year-old with dark hair and stylish clothing who decided to freeze her eggs after taking the Fertilome test. Then there’s Maxine, a 27-year-old medical school graduate with short hair and a warm smile who used the test to help her juggle the timing of starting a family and starting her career.\n\nThe wrinkle: The images of Ella and Maxine are actually stock photos, available for purchase online.\n\nAfter questions from STAT, the company added a disclaimer acknowledging that testimonials are not quite as they were promoted from the start: the names, images, and details of patients’ stories have been changed to safeguard their privacy.\n\nAlong with its social media outreach, Celmatix has held several after-work events for New York City-area women. It hosted one, on a Wednesday night in April, in its offices on Wall Street.\n\nAn ad beckons women to a seminar to learn about “proactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals.”\n\nAnd on a Tuesday evening earlier this summer, the company partnered with a women’s group to host a conversation about “proactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals.” Appetizers, wine, and beer were served — and, in a gesture to the crowd full of women with pregnancy on their minds, non-alcoholic beverages were on the menu, too.\n\nThe company is also trying to reach OB-GYNs whose patients aren’t yet trying to get pregnant — or may be just beginning to try. Celmatix held webinars earlier this summer for OB-GYNs, telling them that the test could help “optimize management plans from the very start.”\n\nDNA analysis points a patient to Walmart for supplements\n\nDr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in the Bay Area, is among a few doctors who’ve been given vouchers by the company to offer the test for $500. She’s been ordering the Fertilome test for her patients about five times a week.\n\nEyvazzadeh said the test recently helped her counsel a patient to forgo a third round of IVF, because the patient had a genetic profile that suggested it would be unlikely to work and wasn’t in a financial position to gamble on such slim odds. (A round of IVF can cost $13,000.) That patient is now considering an egg donor.\n\nAnother one of Eyvazzadeh’s patients is 31-year-old Tara Smith.\n\nTara Smith and her husband, Nick, have spent the past four years trying to conceive. Courtesy Tara Smith\n\nFor Smith, who works as a foster parent providing intensive care in Northern California, there’s nothing more important than family. She’s dreamed of having her own baby since she was a child herself.\n\nThat’s why Smith and her husband have spent about $70,000 over the past four years trying, without success, to get pregnant. They’ve seen doctors in St. Louis and Las Vegas, taken countless blood tests, and tried two rounds of IVF and several cycles of intrauterine insemination. Smith has long known that she has a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, which can make it harder to get pregnant, but no one could figure out exactly why none of the treatments were working.\n\n“It’s gut-wrenching. You’re almost like this alien,” Smith said. “Nobody knows what’s going on, and you can’t fix the problem.”\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nSo when Eyvazzadeh suggested that she take the Fertilome test, Smith jumped at the possibility of finally getting answers. Eyvazzadeh walked her through the results last month before showing her the report, so Smith had an idea of what to expect. Still, Smith said, “my heart sank” when she saw her results for the first time.\n\nShe was 2.88 times more likely to have endometriosis, a painful disorder of the uterus, than a woman without a certain genetic variant. She was 1.54 times more likely to have primary ovarian insufficiency. She also carried three genetic variants that elevated her risk of having recurrent pregnancy loss. And she had 24 additional genetic variants that are more weakly associated with various conditions that can play a role in fertility problems.\n\n“It’s gut-wrenching. You’re almost like this alien. Nobody knows what’s going on, and you can’t fix the problem.” Tara Smith, fertility patient\n\nDespite it all, Eyvazzadeh had a plan. Because many of Smith’s genetic variants were involved in immune response regulation, she instructed Smith to focus on minimizing inflammation.\n\nAt Eyvazzadeh’s recommendation, Smith spent about $200 buying dietary supplements like fish oils, turmeric, cayenne pepper, resveratrol, and berberine from Amazon and Walmart. Smith also embarked on a new diet, cutting out dairy and red meat. (A 2015 review of the evidence on the optimal diet to promote fertility — and the utility of supplements — found the data “conflicting.”)\n\nThey also plan to have Smith get infusions of intralipids — a cocktail of soy bean oil, egg yolks, and other fatty acids — during her third round of IVF, which she’s embarking on now. (Intralipid infusions are increasingly popular, but the practice was found not to help in a 2016 study of older women with a history of miscarriage.)\n\nSmith has mostly positive feelings about her Fertilome test. Having a concrete plan based on what’s in her DNA gives her a new sense of hope. “Now I feel like we’re armed with information,” she said. But at the same time, she said, knowing what may be wrong with her makes her apprehensive about whether she’ll ever get pregnant.\n\nAfter all, so far, the test has pointed her only to try nutritional tweaks of uncertain value. It doesn’t offer any definitive answers.\n\nAnd that’s what gives Dr. Valerie Baker pause. A reproductive endocrinologist at Stanford, she recently suggested the test to a patient with longstanding infertility. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?\n\n“I don’t know,” Baker recalled responding. “I probably wouldn’t do anything differently.”\n\nShe did not end up ordering the test.""]",The story does a thorough job of describing the test and bringing home the crucial point that the type of risk information may be more anxiety-producing than helpful.,"Tests for genetic variants associated with problems linked to infertility are becoming increasingly available, and this story characterizes a new battery of those tests, marketed under the name Fertilome, that professes to be the latest in fertility management.
The story does a thorough job of describing the test and bringing home the crucial point that the type of risk information provided by Fertilome may be more anxiety-producing than helpful to many women. There is as yet no clear causal link between many genetic variants and pregnancy problems, so the kind of relative risk information provided by the test requires substantial contextual information and counseling.
Unfortunately, the company has begun marketing the test directly to women, including those who have not yet embarked on efforts to conceive, possibly making that context even harder to obtain. This STAT story provides just the kind of enterprise reporting the public needs to encourage caution.

The study is published today by The Lancet. Unlike the more common obstructive sleep apnea, in which the airway partially collapses and causes pauses in breathing, central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain fails to control breathing during sleep.\n\n""CSA is a serious concern because it affects about a third of people with heart failure and it\'s known to make the condition worse,"" Abraham said. ""Currently, we don\'t have good treatments available. Positive airway pressure devices have been used, but many patients don\'t tolerate them well and a recent study showed them to be harmful.""\n\nAbraham, along with lead author Dr. Maria Rosa Costanzo at Advocate Heart Institute in Naperville, IL, led the study at 31 hospitals in the United States, Germany and Poland. The research team tested the safety and effectiveness of a transvenous phrenic nerve stimulator made by Respicardia Inc. Much like a pacemaker, it sends a regular signal telling the diaphragm to breathe during sleep.\n\nIn the randomized study, 151 patients were implanted with the device. Ten were excluded due to non-study related medical issues or deaths, exiting the study or missing visits. During the first six months of evaluation, 68 devices were activated for treatment, while 73 were left inactive as the control group. Between six and 12 months of follow-up, all patients received the neurostimulation treatment.\n\nAt the six month evaluation, the device reduced CSA events per hour by half or more for 35 of the 68 members (51 percent) of the treatment group. Only eight (11 percent) of those in the control group achieved the same reduction. Other important sleep measures, such as the amount of time spent with a low blood oxygen level, were also significantly improved. About a third of patients in the treatment group reported therapy-related discomfort that was resolved with some reprogramming of the device.\n\n""Not only did we see this reduction in events per hour, the patients also rated themselves better on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (meaning they were less sleepy during the day) and on a global assessment of their overall quality of life,"" Abraham said. ""This tells us the effects of neurostimulation are clinically relevant and this could be a promising therapy for those with central sleep apnea.""\n\nIn addition to Abraham, Ohio State\'s Dr. Rami Khayat and Dr. Ralph Augostini participated in this research, making Ohio State one of the high enrolling centers participating in the study worldwide.\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded by Respicardia. Abraham is a consultant for the company.']","This release covered most of the major bases with the exception of cost, harms, availability and a note on the study’s novelty.","In a small study published in The Lancet, a nerve-stimulating pacemaker was surgically implanted in patients already suffering from central sleep apnea. The 151 patients were randomly assigned to either an activated  device (68) or to a control group (73) whose device remained inactive. After six months, a little more than half (51%) of the group receiving the active neuro-stimulator device showed their apnea events per night cut in half or more, compared to 11% of the control group with the inactive implant.
The release provided a good discussion of the benefits, and used absolute numbers to quantify them. The principal investigator is a consultant for the device company that paid for the research, which the release disclosed in an end note. The release could have provided more context on how the device might impact future quality of life, and where the neuro-stimulator is placed. One might imagine it is in the brain rather than in the chest pectoral region which is the case here.

Raji, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of radiology at Washington University\'s Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology. ""We showed that a single MRI scan can predict dementia on average 2.6 years before memory loss is clinically detectable, which could help doctors advise and care for their patients.""\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is a progressive, irreversible brain disorder that destroys memory and thinking skills. The disease affects 5.5 million Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nNeurologists can get a ballpark estimate of a patient\'s risk of Alzheimer\'s dementia using the Mini-Mental State Examination questionnaire, or by testing for the high-risk form of the gene ApoE, which increases a person\'s risk of Alzheimer\'s by up to 12-fold. Both tests were about 70 to 80 percent accurate in this study. Other assessments, such as PET scans for plaques of Alzheimer\'s proteins in the brain, are good at detecting early signs of Alzheimer\'s disease, but available to few patients. PET scans cost thousands of dollars and require radioactive materials not found in a typical hospital.\n\nMRI brain scans are widely available and give doctors a glimpse into what\'s going on inside a person\'s brain. Raji and colleagues at the School of Medicine including Tammie Benzinger, MD, PhD, a professor of radiology, Parinaz Massoumzadeh, PhD, and Adedamola Adedokun, as well as radiologist Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, of the University of California San Francisco, analyzed MRI scans for physical signs of impending cognitive decline.\n\nThey used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to assess the health of the brain\'s white matter, which encompasses the cables that enable different parts of the brain to talk to one another.\n\n""Diffusion tensor imaging is a way of measuring the movement of water molecules along white matter tracts,"" Raji said. ""If water molecules are not moving normally it suggests underlying damage to white tracts that can underlie problems with cognition.""\n\nUsing information from the Alzheimer\'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative - a multisite collaboration that pools data, funding and expertise to improve clinical trials for Alzheimer\'s disease - Raji and colleagues identified 10 people whose cognitive skills declined over a two-year period and matched them by age and sex with 10 people whose thinking skills held steady. The average age of people in both groups was 73. Then, the researchers analyzed diffusion tensor MRI scans taken just before the two-year period for all 20 people.\n\nThe researchers found that people who went on to experience cognitive decline had significantly more signs of damage to their white matter. The researchers repeated their analysis in a separate sample of 61 people, using a more refined measure of white matter integrity. With this new analysis, they were able to predict cognitive decline with 89 percent accuracy when looking at the whole brain. When the researchers focused on specific parts of the brain most likely to show damage, the accuracy rose to 95 percent.\n\n""We could tell that the individuals who went on to develop dementia have these differences on diffusion MRI, compared with scans of cognitively normal people whose memory and thinking skills remained intact,"" Raji said. ""What we need now, before we can bring it into the clinic, is to get more control subjects and develop computerized tools that can more reliably compare individual patients\' scans to a baseline normal standard. With that, doctors might soon be able to tell people whether they are likely to have Alzheimer\'s develop in the next few years.""\n\nAlthough there are no drugs available yet to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer\'s disease, identifying those at high risk of developing dementia within the next few years could still be beneficial, the researchers said. People could make decisions on their financial and living arrangements while they are still in full control of their faculties.\n\n###']",Findings from the small study were just presented at a medical conference and haven’t been peer-reviewed.,"This news release announced findings of a study that looked at differences in brain MRI scans between older people who went on to develop Alzheimer’s disease symptoms and those who did not get the disease.
The release said the findings, presented at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago, suggest MRI scans may one day help predict whether people will develop dementia.
The news release mentioned alternative ways to predict Alzheimer’s, but it didn’t say anything about potential harms or costs of using MRIs, and it didn’t explain that the method has not been tested in a clinical trial.

982,story_reviews_00943,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/the-healthy-skeptic-is-caffeine-an-effective-weight-loss-aid/,2012-06-19 00:33:36,The Healthy Skeptic: Is caffeine an effective weight-loss aid?,"['If losing weight was one of your New Year’s resolutions, you might already be growing weary of counting calories and working out. Wouldn’t it be great if you could slim down without so much effort?\n\nAnyone looking for a shortcut to weight loss might be tempted to try one of many supplements that claim to burn fat and boost metabolism. These products often contain a not-especially-exotic ingredient that’s already a staple of the American lifestyle: caffeine.\n\nThe morning coffee drinkers at Dunkin’ Donuts notwithstanding, caffeine has a strong reputation as a weight-loss aid. The stimulant is one of the key ingredients of Zantrex-3, the popular weight-loss supplement from Zoller Laboratories, based in Salt Lake City. The company claims each capsule contains “up to” 160 milligrams of “caffeine and caffeine-like stimulants” (from green tea and yerba mate, among other sources), while a government database of supplements says each capsule of Zantrex-3 contains more than 160 mg of caffeine. That’s slightly more than you’d get from a typical double shot of espresso. Other ingredients include ginseng and damiana, a Latin American herb traditionally used as an aphrodisiac.\n\nUsers are instructed to take two capsules with a glass of water before a meal or anytime during the day when they need an energy boost. According to the label, they shouldn’t take more than six capsules in a day. Zantrex-3 is available at many drugstores. You can expect to pay about $20 for a package of 30 capsules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLipoFuze, a weight-loss supplement from E Nutrition Research, based in Orem, Utah, also packs a significant amount of caffeine. The label says that each capsule contains 200 mg of a green tea extract that is 50% caffeine. Other ingredients include vitamin D, chromium and coenzyme Q10.\n\nUsers are instructed to take two capsules a day. A package of 60, a one-month’s supply, costs about $50.\n\nThe claims\n\nThe website for Zantrex-3 says it provides both extreme energy and rapid weight loss — “546% more weight loss than the leading ephedra-based diet pill,” to be exact. The site features a picture of reality TV star (and official product endorser) Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi of “Jersey Shore” pulling a bottle of the pills out of her purse. (The website calls her a “celebrity,” and, yes, the term is in quotation marks.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy Heaton, director of scientific affairs for Zoller, says that caffeine and caffeine-like compounds have been proved to improve energy, stamina, concentration, mood and metabolism. But, she says, “they have not been shown to significantly increase weight loss.”\n\nHeaton adds that “it’s not just about weight loss. It’s about fat loss and increased energy.” To drive home the message, she points to Snooki’s transformation “from a self-professed meatball to a sexy and slim fireball.”\n\nThe website for LipoFuze says that the supplement “increases the metabolic mechanism in your body.” The site also says the green tea and caffeine will “rev up your metabolism” and “increase energy, focus and physical performance.” The site features testimonials it says are from users who claim they have lost huge amounts of weight with the help of LipoFuze. One man says he dropped more than 100 pounds, although it’s unclear how long that took. A woman says she lost 40 pounds in less than a year, including 20 pounds in her first month.\n\nAttempts to reach E Nutrition Research for comment were not successful.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nCaffeine shows up in a lot of weight-loss products, but it doesn’t seem to be any sort of silver bullet against flab, says C. Michael White, a professor of pharmacy at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. White says that, to his knowledge, there are no well-designed studies showing that caffeine works better than a placebo when it comes to weight loss.\n\nWhite notes that caffeine is a diuretic, which means that people taking large doses might shed some weight through water loss, but that’s not the kind of slimming most users are looking for.\n\nAs reported in a 2010 issue of the International Journal of Obesity, caffeine may in fact be able to increase a person’s metabolic rate by 4% or 5%. But, according to White, there’s no clear evidence that this translates into actual weight loss. One possible explanation: Any increase in metabolism might go hand-in-hand with a boost in appetite, he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaffeine does seem to enhance the weight-loss powers of some other ingredients, White says. For example, green tea contains antioxidants that encourage cells to burn extra calories, and caffeinated green tea seems to promote more weight loss than decaf versions. But even this combination yields very modest results. “In clinical trials, the weight loss is 2.5 to 4 pounds, not 40 pounds,” White says.\n\nGerald Endress, the fitness director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C., says patients often ask about caffeine as a weight-loss aid. “I tell them it’s definitely not going to be as helpful as 30 minutes of exercise.”\n\nEndress says a little caffeine before a workout might help a person exercise harder and longer, which could theoretically help them control their weight. But the real credit would go to the exercise, not the caffeine.\n\nEndress also warns that too much caffeine — such as the high doses found in Zantrex — could cause jitteriness, anxiety, spikes in blood pressure and rapid heartbeats in some people.\n\nCurious about a consumer health product?

It doesn\'t involve any high-priced new pharmaceuticals -- the key may be an over-the-counter vitamin supplement that costs less than $10 a month.\n\nResearchers found that a form of vitamin B3 called nicotinamide could help reduce the chance of skin cancer recurring in patients who\'ve had it before. (Another popular form of Vitamin B3 called niacin was not used in this study.)\n\nFor the study, researchers in Australia looked at nearly 400 people who had had at least two non-melanoma skin cancers. They found patients who took vitamin B3 twice a day cut their chances of developing new skin cancers by 23 percent.\n\n""That\'s a dramatic number,"" Dr. David Agus, director of USC\'s Norris Westside Cancer Center, told ""CBS This Morning."" ""It could make a major impact.""\n\nVitamin B3 could help skin cancer patients\n\nDr. Jae Jung, a dermatologist at City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, California, agreed. ""If you can reduce the new skin cancer rates for these patients, it would be an enormous benefit,"" she told CBS News.\n\nHow does it work? Sunlight\'s ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, increasing the risk for skin cancer. Researchers say vitamin B3 gives skin cells an energy boost -- ""turns back on the immune system,"" in Agus\'s words -- helping them repair the damage.\n\nNearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer in the U.S. each year, and the Skin Cancer Foundation says 1 out of 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.\n\nThe two most common forms of the disease, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, can usually be treated successfully. The most dangerous type, melanoma, occurs in about 73,000 people in the U.S. each year and kills more than 9,900.\n\nOne patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years. She said she\'s had ""quite a few on the top of my head, a few on the back of my head, one behind each ear,"" even though she tries to stay out of the sun. Wiese had leukemia as a teenager and underwent radiation therapy, which put her at high risk for skin cancer later in life.\n\nWiese thinks the vitamin study sounds promising. ""I am absolutely willing to try it and hope for the best,"" she said.\n\nDoctors involved in the study are excited by their findings on vitamin B3 nicotinamide. ""It\'s safe, it\'s almost obscenely inexpensive, and it\'s already widely commercially available,"" Dr. Diona Damian, the senior author of the study and a professor of dermatology at the University of Sydney, told HealthDay.\n\nBut she said more reserach is needed to see if everyone benefits from it. ""It\'s not something we\'d recommend at this stage for the general population,"" Damian said. She also noted that the benefits appear to wear off when patients stop taking the supplements.\n\nResults of the study are being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology later this month.']","Spoonfeeding research to journalists on a conference call, before it’s been peer-reviewed or published, leads to incomplete reports such as this one.","Less thorough than a competing Associated Press (AP) story on the same study, this online CBS story emphasizes the “dramatic” and “enormous” benefits that a cheap over-the-counter vitamin pill could have for the prevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer. But it never quantifies that benefit in a way that would provide a meaningful measure of impact. It also never mentions tried-and-true skin cancer prevention methods — e.g. limiting exposure, using shade, and applying sunscreen — that were front and center in AP’s coverage. And CBS doesn’t explicitly point out that the cancers prevented in this study were of the nonlethal variety — readers will need to make that leap for themselves based on the story’s somewhat disjointed description.
Both stories could have done more to alert readers to the preliminary nature of these findings, which come from an abstract to be presented at a conference that’s still several weeks away. It’s almost impossible adequately to evaluate the quality of research that’s announced on a conference call before it’s even been presented to other scientists.

This caused international interest, but the study was very short as it was only eight weeks and the question remained whether the diabetes would stay away.\n\nIn this new study, 30 volunteers with Type 2 diabetes embarked on the same diet of 600 to 700 calories a day. Participants lost on average 14 kilograms - just over 2 stone. Over the next 6 months they did not regain any weight.\n\nThe group included many people with longer duration diabetes, defined as more than 8 years and ranging up to 23 years.\n\nOverall, 12 patients who had had diabetes for less than 10 years reversed their condition. 6 months later they remained diabetes free. In fact, after 6 months a thirteenth patient had reversed their diabetes.\n\nThough the volunteers lost weight they remained overweight or obese but they had lost enough weight to remove the fat out of the pancreas and allow normal insulin production.\n\nProfessor Roy Taylor said: ""What we have shown is that it is possible to reverse your diabetes, even if you have had the condition for a long time, up to around 10 years. If you have had the diagnosis for longer than that, then don\'t give up hope - major improvement in blood sugar control is possible.\n\n""The study also answered the question that people often ask me - if I lose the weight and keep the weight off, will I stay free of diabetes? The simple answer is yes!\n\n""Interestingly, even though all our volunteers remained obese or overweight, the fat did not drift back to clog up the pancreas.\n\n""This supports our theory of a Personal Fat Threshold. If a person gains more weight than they personally can tolerate, then diabetes is triggered, but if they then lose that amount of weight then they go back to normal.\n\n""Individuals vary in how much weight they can carry without it seeming to affect their metabolism - don\'t forget that 70% of severely obese people do not have diabetes.\n\n""The bottom line is that if a person really wants to get rid of their Type 2 diabetes, they can lose weight, keep it off and return to normal.\n\n""This is good news for people who are very motivated to get rid of their diabetes. But it is too early to regard this as suitable for everyone. That is a separate question and a major study is underway to answer this.""\n\nThe study\n\nParticipants in this study had Type 2 diabetes for between six months and 23 years. The team showed that Type 2 diabetes could be reversed even in people who had the condition for 10 years.\n\nThe team were able to identify in advance participants who would not respond to adequate weight loss by reversing their diabetes as at the start they had almost absent insulin production from the pancreas.\n\nThe study was funded by a National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR BRC) grant.\n\nA larger trial involving 280 patients is already underway.

It is the first trial of its kind in the world.\n\nThe nanoparticles, or nanoshells, are made of small layers of silica glass formed into a sphere and wrapped in a thin layer of gold. The shells seek out and saturate cancerous cells, and their advanced vibrational properties are then harnessed to cause the tumorous tissue to pulse with extreme temperature when light is applied through a laser specifically designed to excite the particles. The oscillation kills the cancer cells while preserving the healthy tissue, avoiding the nerves and urinary sphincter. This procedure is the first in the world that is precise enough to potentially avoid negative ramifications like urinary incontinence or sexual impotency.\n\n“This therapy could be life-changing for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and I’m honored to be among the first doctors the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved to put it to the test,” said Steven Canfield, M.D., chair of the division of urology at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, who recognized the possibility of the nanoparticles to treat prostate cancer and helped developed the trial to test the theory.\n\nProstate cancer begins when cells in a man’s prostate gland mutate and start to grow uncontrollably. Other than skin cancer, prostate is the most common cancer in American men, with an estimated 1 out of 9 men diagnosed. The American Cancer Society estimates 29,430 men died from the disease in 2018 alone.\n\nTreatment options have traditionally included radical prostatectomy, which is the removal of the prostate gland and some of the tissue around it, radiation therapy and cryotherapy, among others. These methods carry the potential to have a negative impact on urinary function and sexual performance.\n\n“The side effects of current prostate cancer treatments can be extremely traumatic. This new technology holds the potential to eliminate those life-altering effects, while still removing the cancer tissue and reducing hospital and recovery time,” Canfield said. “In fact, the first patient in the trial was actually riding a bike within a week of his treatment. The fusion of MRI and ultrasound imaging technology that we use to accurately identify and diagnose the cancer, combined with the extreme precision of the gold nanoshells in targeting the diseased cells, allows us to be incredibly accurate at obliterating them. I am excited as we continue tracking the progress of this groundbreaking improvement to prostate cancer care.”\n\nDoug Flewellen, the first patient in Texas to receive the new method of care, says for him, the procedure was a no-brainer.\n\n“No man wants to go through radical removal, and I knew active monitoring could have potentially aggravated the cancer,” Flewellen said. “The side effects of traditional treatment were not worth it to me, and I wasn’t afraid to try the most cutting-edge technology. Looking back, the experience was even better than I was expecting, and I hope to see nanoparticle therapy advance into an option for anyone diagnosed with prostate cancer in the future.”\n\nThe gold nanoparticles were invented by Naomi Halas, the head of Rice University’s Laboratory for Nanophotonics. Canfield worked closely with Halas and Nanospectra Biosciences, the company where the shells are licensed, to incorporate the state-of-the-art technology into the trial that is also underway at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the University of Michigan to test the efficacy of the therapy.\n\nTo see the requirements and learn more about the trial, visit: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02680535.\n\nAbout UTHealth\n\nEstablished in 1972 by The University of Texas System Board of Regents, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) is Houston’s Health University and Texas’ resource for health care education, innovation, scientific discovery and excellence in patient care.

Two testimonials, one from the lead researcher testing this new approach and a single patient who underwent the procedure, cannot together purport to be a solid basis for judging the worthiness of this bit of new high tech wizardry.  We know that other techniques to treat prostate cancer, including active surveillance, have varying levels of success but there is no sense how those compare to the gold nanoparticle approach.

The results, based upon nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the United States, are reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\n""This study contributes to growing evidence that ADHD medication is linked to lower risk for many types of harmful behavior, including substance abuse,"" said Patrick D. Quinn, a postdoctoral researcher in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences\' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who led the study. ""The results also highlight the importance of careful diagnosis and compliance with treatment.""\n\nAs one of the largest analyses on the risks and benefits of ADHD medication, the study drew on anonymous health care data from 146 million people with employer-based health insurance in the United States from 2005 to 2014.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers mined the data to identify people with ADHD whose records showed periods of ADHD medication use and periods without ADHD medication use -- as well as one or more visits to the emergency room due to drug or alcohol use. They then calculated the odds of the visits occurring during the person\'s use of ADHD medication versus the same person\'s non-use of ADHD medication.\n\n""Many factors can influence who receives ADHD treatment, including socioeconomic factors, health care access, the strength of support networks and disorder severity,"" Quinn said. ""Although no single study of real-world treatment practices can definitively show whether medication use lowers risk, studying the same people at different points in their medical history helps us control for these factors and isolate the role of medication in their behavior.""\n\nOf the nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the study\'s database, about 57 percent experienced periods in which they were and were not prescribed medication to treat the disorder. About 2 percent experienced an emergency room visit due to substance abuse. The median age of the study\'s participants was 21 for men and 28 for women.\n\nThe majority of the ADHD medicines used in the study were stimulants such as Adderall, an amphetamine, and Ritalin, or methylphenidate. A significantly smaller number used nonstimulant ADHD medication such as Strattera, or atomoxetine.\n\n""While concerns about prescribing medications to treat ADHD that have the potential for abuse are understandable, this study provides further evidence that the use of these medications is not associated with increased risk of substance use problems in adolescence or adulthood,"" Quinn said. ""Rather, this and other recent studies find that the risk of such problems is lower during and after periods of use of these medications.""\n\nQuinn is a member of the lab of Brian M. D\'Onofrio, a professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Another study from this group recently reported in JAMA Psychiatry found that the use of ADHD medication was associated with lower risk of motor vehicle accidents in men and women.\n\nD\'Onofrio is also a co-author of several studies based on patient data from Sweden that found similarly lower risk for substance abuse and transport accidents in people with ADHD who used medication.\n\nThe larger number of people in the two more recent studies -- as well as the use of U.S. patients in the new analyses -- strengthens this earlier evidence.\n\n""Together, these studies provide accumulating evidence about the possible short- and long-term benefits of ADHD medications,"" D\'Onofrio said. ""They also provide important information to medical providers who prescribe ADHD medication -- as well as to adults with the disorder and parents trying to make medical decisions for children. Overall, I think people should find these results reassuring.""\n\n###\n\nOther authors on the study were Martin E. Rickert, a research scientist at IU; Kwan Hur, Robert D. Gibbons and Benjamin B.

While the news release puts a positive spin on the use of stimulants for ADHD, it doesn’t mention that some co-authors have financial conflicts of interest with makers of ADHD medications. In addition, the release overstates the benefits of ADHD medication by reporting the relative risk reduction rather than absolute numbers. It also omits any mention of medication side effects.

1026,story_reviews_00694,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/mail-order-viruses-are-the-new-antibiotics/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,Mail-Order Viruses Are The New Antibiotics,"['Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed\n\nRachel George was used to being sick. A genetic condition left her with intellectual disabilities and a weak immune system. By 26, she had endured dozens of bacterial infections — kidney, ear, sinus, heart, bone, and more — and taken hundreds of antibiotic pills. But when she entered the Harborview Hospital in Seattle for a foot operation, her body’s defenses were pushed to a new limit. Hospitals are hotbeds for nasty — and sometimes deadly — infections. After her surgery, Rachel’s lungs picked up two: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both bugs are part of a growing category of bacterial infections that don’t respond to traditional antibiotics. Rachel was supposed to be in the hospital for five days. She stayed nine weeks. She developed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and was put on a ventilator with a tube down her throat. When her doctors finally released her, they told her mother she had three years to live, at most, before the bugs won. Three years later, in January 2010, Rachel was indeed close to death. She was spending half of every month in intensive care, the other half at home, an IV constantly dripping into her bloodstream. By then she had cycled through more than a dozen powerful antibiotics. Each time the doctors would give her a new drug, then watch helplessly as the bacteria overpowered it. “Every time we took her back to the hospital, it was a question of whether or not this was going to be it,” her mother, Rose George, told BuzzFeed News. One day the nurse on duty asked Rose if she’d ever considered phage therapy. Rose had never heard of it, and that’s unsurprising: The therapy, which uses specialized viruses (called bacteriophages) to kill bacteria, is only available in a handful of former Soviet countries. Rose asked her daughter’s doctor, but she’d never heard of phage either. Soon Rose was on the phone with doctors at a small clinic in Tbilisi, in the Republic of Georgia, ordering 100 glass vials of viruses at $8 a pop. She’s one of at least 300 people desperate enough to try this little-known viral therapy from Eastern Europe. It’s an extreme solution to what may be this century’s biggest medical crisis: the death of antibiotics.\n\nSince the discovery of penicillin in 1928, scientists have amassed a medical arsenal of more than 130 antibiotics. The drugs have prevented soldiers from losing limbs, and mothers from dying during childbirth. With access to antibiotics, parents no longer worry about losing their kid to an ear infection or bad scrape. But now antibiotics are everywhere — not just in orange pill bottles, but in the food given to pigs, cattle, and chicken. And the more the bugs interact with antibiotics, the quicker they evolve defense mechanisms. At least 18 strains of bacteria have evolved into “superbugs,” becoming resistant to most of our drugs. And pharmaceutical companies, more interested in profitable blockbusters like Viagra and Zoloft, haven’t developed a new class of antibiotics in 25 years. We’re dying because of it. More than 23,000 people in the U.S. die each year from antibiotic-resistant infections. By 2050, an estimated 10 million people worldwide will die by superbug. After two decades of warnings from the scientific community, the problem is finally getting serious attention. In his 2016 budget proposal released today, U.S. President Obama threw $1.2 billion at tackling the antibiotic-resistance crisis — nearly double the amount allocated last year. If approved by Congress, this money will go toward screening soil samples for new antibiotics, reducing the drugs in livestock feed, boosting hospital surveillance, and, perhaps, making phage therapy a viable option in the U.S. Phages are bacteria’s natural enemies. They work by injecting their DNA inside bacterial cells, where they replicate wildly, produce new phages, and eventually cause the bacteria to rupture — releasing even more viruses to hunt for bacterial prey. Phages’ power comes from two places: They are the most common and diverse organisms on Earth, and each phage harms only specific strains of bacteria. When you turn on the faucet, millions of phages flow out with your tap water. That leaves a nearly inexhaustible supply of potential agents to use in the fight against infection. Doctors have been using phages to kill bacteria for nearly a century — just not in the U.S. In 1923, a Georgian doctor named George Eliava set up the first phage therapy clinic, the Eliava Institute, in Tbilisi. Antibiotics hadn’t been discovered yet, so phages were a revolutionary weapon against all kinds of infections, Ryland Young, head of the Center for Phage Technology at Texas A&M University, told BuzzFeed News. “It was kind of pre-scientific — no one knew what these phages were except that they worked.” Five years later, penicillin came along. Effective, cheap, and quick to produce in large quantities, doctors in the U.S., U.K., and France quickly seized upon the “miracle drug” as a key to winning World War II. That also meant keeping this weapon away from the Soviets. With no access to antibiotics, scientists behind the Iron Curtain bolstered their use of phages instead. “At its very peak, when they were supplying the Russian army, the Eliava Institute was producing two to three tons of phages per day,” Zamphira Alavidze, a microbiologist in Tbilisi who worked at the Eliava Institute for 45 years, told BuzzFeed News. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, Eliava’s phage production dropped significantly, and it downsized into a small research center. Today Georgian doctors frequently use antibiotics to treat infections, but often in combination with phages. “Every clinic, everywhere in Georgia, everybody uses the phages,” Alavidze said. The last decade, she added, has brought another big change: Two small phage clinics in Tbilisi have sprung up to cater specifically to the boom of international patients like Rachel. “Ten or fifteen years ago, nobody believed the phages would be so popular. They thought we were crazy,” Alavidze said. “Now, it’s not too easy to come to Georgia, but we try to help somehow because sometimes nothing else works.”\n\nRandy Wolcott, a wound care doctor in Lubbock, Texas, first went to Tbilisi in 2007. He was fed up with the lack of options for his patients with drug-resistant infections, and wanted to investigate phages as a treatment of last resort. Wolcott spent a week at the Eliava Institute. It looked nothing like the gleaming and sterile high-rises of most U.S. hospitals — the building was small, some of the equipment looked ancient, and the walls were unpainted. But after observing the Georgian clinicians at work, Wolcott was sold. He walked into a city pharmacy and bought hundreds of vials of phages concocted for wound infections. “They were very cheap, and I bought them by the case,” Wolcott told BuzzFeed News. The only hiccup came when explaining his viral cargo to U.S. customs officials. “It can cause some problems when our government hears that you’re bringing viruses back from a former Soviet country,” Wolcott said, chuckling. “It’s hard to explain. It’s a virus, but it’s a virus only for bacteria, not for us.” Phages aren’t approved for use in the U.S. So, once back in Lubbock, Wolcott wrote to the Texas Board of Medicine and asked for permission to use the viruses on his wound patients. The board decided that, because these patients had exhausted all other options, Wolcott would be allowed to use the experimental treatment in a legal arrangement known as “compassionate use.” Wolcott’s patients saw improvement within days. In 11 of the cases, the patients’ wounds healed enough to save their limbs. He treated hundreds of patients using the original batch of phages he brought over from Tbilisi. Five years ago, he went back for more. Wolcott usually uses the phages in combination with traditional antibiotics. But he says he couldn’t have offered the same quality of treatment without the viruses. “Someone needs to do this in America,” Wolcott said. “To have a bank of stuff that we can turn to for these chronic infections? That would be huge.”\n\nUntil that happens, though, patients are looking abroad. Rose George’s internet search led her to a clinic in Tbilisi called the Phage Therapy Center. It was set up in 2005 by Phage International, a fledgling medical tourism outfit founded in Danville, California, by a computer scientist named Chris Smith. The center’s doctors asked Rose to send over a bacterial sample from Rachel’s lungs. Over the course of a month, Rose attempted to send several samples, but each was rejected by U.S. customs. Rose’s son tried driving a sample across the border into Canada, which led to a seven-hour interrogation by Canadian agents, followed by two more hours with the FBI on the U.S. side. Finally, Smith suggested that Rose ambiguously label the package as “medical records.” She did, and the shipment slipped through. A few weeks later, the Georgian doctors called Rose with good news: They would be able to design a concoction of phages to treat Rachel’s infections. After convincing Rachel’s doctor to write a prescription for the viruses (so they could cross the U.S. border), Rose paid the Georgian clinic $800 for a three-month supply. She was surprised that phages were so inexpensive; in contrast, her insurance company was forking over roughly $14,000 a month for Rachel’s antibiotics. A couple of weeks later, 10 boxes filled with 100 vials of phages landed on the Georges’ doorstep. Rose used a nebulizer to administer the phages twice a day so that Rachel could breathe the liquids into her lungs. Within three weeks, Rachel’s MRSA — the same infection she’d been fighting with antibiotics for three years — disappeared. It hasn’t returned in the five years since.\n\nAdvocates of phage therapy see it as a powerful new weapon in the war we’re quickly losing against bacterial infection. But phages are certainly not a cure-all. Just ask Roger Mintey, a 65-year-old retired accountant from the sleepy English town of Reigate. In 1991, Mintey caught a severe sinus infection that left him with a near-constant cold. He’s had it, on and off, ever since. In the first decade of fighting his illness, Mintey sought help at five English hospitals, underwent two surgeries, and took more than two dozen courses of antibiotics. Nothing worked. In 2006, he heard about phage therapy from his cousin’s wife, who’d gone to Tbilisi to treat a chronic bladder infection. She pointed Roger to Phage International, the same company that helped Rose George get her daughter’s phages. The Georgian doctors affiliated with the company said they could treat his sinus infection, so Mintey cut Phage International a check for $5,000 and sent a sample of his nasal discharge to Georgia via FedEx. Then, accompanied by a friend, he boarded his first-ever plane to fly to the company’s Phage Therapy Center. They landed in Tbilisi at 3 a.m. and were met by someone from the clinic, who escorted them to their hotel. Mintey was instructed to drink a phage preparation three times a day from his hotel room. Every couple of days he would go into the clinic for additional phage treatments. The clinic was inside a nondescript building, set up something like an indoor mall. ""You went through a set of double doors, passed by a suntanning place, and there you were: one office, two treatment rooms, and that was it,” Mintey told BuzzFeed News. A doctor and two nurses had him sit on a cushioned patient’s chair. They tipped the chair back so his nostrils faced up, and poured the phage liquid into his nose. He was instructed to say the word “cuckoo” as the phages slowly slid into all of his sinuses, seeping out from his nasal passages into his forehead and cheekbones. His nose started bleeding, but the clinicians told him it was nothing to worry about. They also gave him a shot of manuka honey extract in his butt, telling him it had antimicrobial properties. “It was all quite uncomfortable,” Mintey said. After two weeks, Mintey flew back to England. Three days later, his infection was back. “I realized the entire treatment had done absolutely nothing,” he said. Mintey claims to have called, emailed, faxed, and sent physical letters to his doctors in Georgia and to Phage International’s headquarters in California. He heard nothing back. (Smith, of Phage International, claims that emails sent to Roger at the time were bouncing, and that he only had Mintey’s friend’s phone number.) Eventually, the clinic sent Mintey more phages in the mail, but the infection persisted. He says he has not heard from them since. “I was very disappointed,” Mintey said. “By the end of 2007, I had given up on phages.” Mintey’s situation highlights many of the difficulties surrounding a therapy only accessible through a small and largely unregulated medical tourism industry. Smith says Phage International has served more than 300 patients to date, with some 4,000 registered on its website. He wants to open a new phage therapy clinic in Trinidad, which could be easier for American patients to visit. “During the past 10 years, you’d go to an investor or venture capitalist, and they’d never heard of phage — and they didn’t want to know about it,” he said. “Now that’s changed.” Nothing about Phage International is decidedly illegal, I. Glenn Cohen, a law professor at Harvard’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics, told BuzzFeed News. But there are many ethical issues at play. What happens when something goes wrong? Or, as in Roger’s case, when a patient feels like he’s not getting what he paid for? “Who do you go after? Where do you do it?” Cohen said. “That’s where things get more tricky.”']","Our first review of a BuzzFeed story awards 3 stars. We appreciate the depth of the reporting, but our reviewers had some serious concerns about the framing of this story and its reliance on anecdote.","The vividness of anecdotes “makes” and — if you’re particular about evidence — “breaks” this story about the use of phages as an alternative to antibiotics. The story’s gripping narrative is dominated by one woman’s tale of successful, apparently life-saving treatment with phages. No concerns or doubt about the treatment creep in until more than than halfway down this 2,900-word story, when we’re offered a competing anecdote about a failed treatment. The question of systematic evidence (or the lack thereof) is raised very far down in the story and isn’t emphasized as much as was warranted.
These concerns aside, we’re pleased to see a news outlet devoting such significant space and resources to an important health story. We look forward to sinking our teeth into future BuzzFeed offerings.

A cardboard box may be the safest place for your baby to sleep,"['‘‘To new moms: (SUID) was one of my biggest fears and then it happened,’’ said 35-year-old Chauntia Williams, of Maple Heights, Ohio.\n\nParents are beginning to take baby boxes home from hospitals along with their newborns. A Los Angeles-based company has partnered with health officials to give the boxes away for free and an online initiative offers advice aimed at reducing sudden unexpected infant deaths. New Jersey and Ohio were the first to participate statewide in the program.\n\nTRENTON, N.J. — Cardboard boxes certainly aren’t new technology. But when they’re linked to a practice that started in Finland decades ago to help babies sleep safely, they’re taking on a new purpose as so-called baby boxes make their way to the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams is an advocate for safe sleeping and the boxes after she unexpectedly lost her 33-day-old daughter Aaliyah nine years ago. Williams said her daughter went to sleep in a crib with cushiony bumpers, stuffed animals and an added blanket beneath the fitted sheet and never woke up. She said the coroner determined the bedding caused the death.\n\nShe now uses a box with her son, Bryce, though he’s getting a little too big for it. Her message to new parents: Educate yourselves on safe sleep habits.\n\n‘‘Open your mouth and say I’m concerned about this so you can get the assistance,’’ Williams said.\n\nSudden unexpected infant death is a broad category that includes sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation and strangulation that could come from overcrowded bassinets or cribs. The boxes aren’t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they’re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program.\n\nOhio on Wednesday joined New Jersey in offering the cardboard boxes, which double as bassinets, for free. Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states. The for-profit company also operates in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.’s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.\n\nThe idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey’s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.\n\nThe boxes are a new idea for many Americans.\n\n‘‘The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like ‘wow that’s weird,’’’ said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.\n\nPeterson’s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.\n\nMcCans says the complimentary items like diapers and onesies are nice, but the more important objective behind the boxes is bringing down infant deaths and grounding parents on safe sleep practices: Place babies on their backs to sleep; Don’t use bumpers in cribs; Keep stuffed animals and blankets out of infants’ sleep spaces; Avoid sleeping in the same bed as infants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘‘No one brings their baby into bed with them because they want their baby to die,’’ she said. ‘‘They do it because they want to be nurturing and they are, but it’s not safe.’’\n\nTo get the boxes, prospective moms can register through babyboxuniversity.com, watch a handful of videos on sleep safety and pass a quiz. Parents can then take their digital or printed-out certificates to a participating hospital for their boxes. The boxes can also be sent in the mail, if a nearby hospital is not designated as a distribution center.']","Why this box and not any clean box? By registering with the Baby Box University to get their free box, are parents opening themselves up to a deluge of ads for baby products sold on the company website?","Hospitals in New Jersey and Ohio and in a few cities across the United States are giving away cardboard boxes to parents of newborns as part of an effort to decrease accidental infant deaths by providing an uncluttered place for the child to sleep.
This story about the initiative does not include any research results about these boxes, but implies that they are making babies safer without evidence. Parents may learn more about infant sleep safety when they watch some videos as part of getting their box. We wish the story had directly asked the for-profit company how it can afford to give these boxes away and how it makes money. Are the boxes a loss leader for other products the company hopes to sell? Is the information collected by Baby Box sold to companies who want to market to these parents? Readers want to know how this works and whether the boxes really are “free” or come with hidden costs. An outside expert would have been helpful here, too, perhaps providing insight into what constitutes safe sleeping and how the boxes might be an aid, or whether other factors might be at play.
In Finland, the gift of a box to parents is credited with helping decrease infant sleeping deaths, but it could also be that national health insurance and better care for pregnant women and new mothers also contributed.

Sensitive means it’s unlikely that the test would miss a case of cancer. Specific means that the test is unlikely to be positive if cancer isn’t really present.\n\nBased on the levels of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG detected, the men were given numerical scores that were classified as being high, medium, or low.\n\nThose scores were then compared to the biopsy results.\n\n“The men in the highest group have a risk of cancer on biopsy of about 70% and those in the lowest group have a risk of cancer of about 20%,” says Tomlins.\n\nResearchers then narrowed their analysis to see how the urine test scores matched the men’s Gleason score, which helps doctors gauge how aggressive a cancer may be.\n\n“What we’ve found is that your risk of having an aggressive cancer if you’re in the high group is about 40%, and if you’re in the low group, the risk of having an aggressive cancer is only about 7%,” Tomlins says.\n\nThe company that developed the test, Gen-Probe, helped to pay for the study, and several authors said they had a personal financial interest in the technology.\n\n“This is great science,” says J. Stephen Jones, MD, chairman of the department of regional urology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n\nNow that the researchers have validated the test, further studies in larger, more diverse populations will be important to understand how it is best used.\n\n“The real key is using this or any test to help drive decisions,” says Jones, who was not involved in the research, “If it helps me to know who to biopsy or not biopsy, that’s massively valuable information.”']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Let the data dictate the merits of the test.  Describing it as a “painless urine test’ in the lede is cheerleading.  Besides tests requiring catheterization, most urine tests are <em><strong>painfree!</strong></em></span>","This is a story about a potential new test that may improve the ability to determine when a man with elevated circulating PSA levels has prostate cancer and perhaps better predict if the prostate cancer that a man has is aggressive or not.  While mentioning in passing that additional studies are necessary to determine whether this set of tests really does improve the ability to predict the behavior of a man’s prostate cancer, the overall tone of this story was that this test is the tool that doctors have been waiting for.  The enthusiasm for a new test ought to be tempered until there is sufficient data demonstrating that it is successful.  It is certainly worth noting that while many other markers have been evaulated to improve the accuracy of the PSA test, few have been widely adopted and none have been rigorously evaluated for effectiveness in clinical trials.

The Long Island teen survived, thanks to a police officer who grabbed a defibrillator and shocked his heart back into rhythm.\n\nA blow to the chest — one that hits at just the wrong spot, at just the wrong time — can trigger deadly cardiac arrest. Fortunately it\'s rare. But most victims are otherwise healthy kid athletes. And survival hinges on fast use of those heart-zapping defibrillators that not every athletic league or school keeps near the playing fields.\n\nThere soon may be another attempt at protection: A U.S. organization that oversees athletic equipment has proposed the first performance standard for chest protectors to reduce the risk from those blows, a step that could lead to updated gear.\n\nNancy Crowley finds it hard to watch her three sports-loving sons\' games since Jack\'s scary near-miss in a batting cage a year ago. She calls the latest move by the athletic industry overdue.\n\n""You cannot live in a bubble,"" acknowledged Crowley, who helped lobby local athletic officials to improve access to defibrillators but wants more protection. ""If a standard has come along that they feel is going to protect them in some way, I\'m thrilled.""\n\nCardiac arrest, when the heart abruptly stops beating, is uncommon in young people, especially athletes who presumably are in their prime. There are no good counts in kids\' athletics. Whatever the number — or whatever the cause — cardiac arrest is getting more attention from parents, coaches and heart specialists who say deaths should be preventable.\n\nIndeed, NCAA guidelines recently reported in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology say defibrillators should be kept in the immediate vicinity of ""high risk locations"" such as weight rooms, basketball courts and ball fields.\n\nFor younger students, many states have laws encouraging or requiring defibrillators in schools but few specify athletic facilities, according to the advocacy group Parent Heart Watch.\n\nThe most frequent cause of cardiac arrest in a young athlete is an underlying structural problem of the heart, such as a thickened heart muscle, the problem often behind headline-making collapses of basketball players.\n\nThe chest protector standards take aim at a different problem: Every year, an estimated 10 to 20 people suffer what\'s called commotio cordis — cardiac arrest caused by a blow to the chest. A voluntary registry that has collected information on more than 250 cases over two decades does show survival increasing in recent years thanks to more defibrillator access.\n\nThe highest risk is to boys under 15, when the chest wall is still flexible, not as sturdy as it will become by their 20s when such deaths hardly ever are reported.\n\nAbout a third of the time, victims were wearing some form of chest protector when they collapsed, showing at least some of today\'s equipment isn\'t enough, said Dr. Mark Link, a heart specialist at Tufts University Medical Center who spent more than a decade unraveling just how commotio cordis occurs.\n\nLink\'s tests, using young pigs as a model, revealed that killer hits are those landing directly over the heart, at about 40 miles an hour — and in the milliseconds between heartbeats.\n\nArmed with that science, the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, or NOCSAE, funded creation of a sort of crash-test dummy to prove what gear really reduces the risk, and proposed the first standard for chest protectors used in baseball and lacrosse that aim to do so.\n\nThe idea: find materials that disperse the heart-damaging force of a blow without impeding players\' movements — whether they\'re catchers or youngsters playing other positions who may wear shirt-like chest coverings under their uniforms. Guarding against commotio cordis may require a different design than standard foam that blocks a broken rib. Among the questions is how to integrate protection against both.\n\nThe standard is expected to be completed in January; only then could manufacturers label gear certified as meeting it. NOCSAE\'s recommendations often are adopted by sports governing bodies. It\'s not clear what such gear would cost.\n\nAlready, one company that uses military-grade materials in sports equipment has developed some lightweight protection it expects to fit the bill. In March, Link\'s team published lab tests in the Journal of Clinical Sports Medicine suggesting a combination of foams and polymers used by Pennsylvania-based Unequal Technologies is likely to be effective. The company, which funded the research, is producing chest protectors and heart-covering shirts that it plans to test against the final NOCSAE standard.\n\n""If we can stop a bullet, we can stop a ball,"" said Unequal chief executive Rob Vito.\n\nOther manufacturers are traveling to NOCSAE\'s lab to learn to test products. Stan Jurga Jr. of All-Star Sporting Goods, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer, wonders if he\'ll need to alter equipment aimed at professionals, too, because teens sometimes wear the adult sizes.\n\n""Those are the real-world challenges,"" said Jurga, who also is pursuing a protective shirt. But he applauded the science, saying, ""the last thing anyone wants is a false sense of security.""']","The story doesn’t provide many details on benefits, costs and quality of the evidence. It also lacked sources who were unaffiliated with the research or the advocacy efforts.","This is a story about the rare event known as “commotio cordis,” when the heart stops due to a blow to the chest.

1042,story_reviews_00914,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/a-new-approach-to-treating-hair-loss/,2012-02-21 05:00:00,A New Approach to Treating Hair Loss,"['A new report highlights a novel way for doctors to replace thinning hairlines: transplanting leg hair.\n\nThe report, a study of two cases published in The Archives of Dermatology, describes a new procedure in which receding hairlines were restored by taking hair follicles from patients’ legs and grafting them to the head. Men’s leg hair had successfully been transplanted before to the back of the head, but these are believed to be the first documented cases of leg hair being used to restore the hairline.\n\nThe procedure has the potential to restore the hairlines of millions of men with male pattern baldness, the most common cause of hair loss and often an enormous source of stress. The condition, also called androgenic alopecia, typically begins at the hairline and eventually creates a horseshoe-shaped pattern of hair around the ears. It stems from a sensitivity — largely genetic — to the effects of hormones on hair follicles.\n\nIn traditional transplants, hair follicles are taken from an area that runs an inch or two above the ears and temples to the back of the head. Dermatologists can transplant follicles from this area – called the safe donor zone because hair follicles there are impervious to the hormones that cause hair loss – to the front of the head without worrying that the hair that grows from them will fall out. But hair that comes from the back of the head is typically much coarser than the fine hair that grows in front.\n\n“If you look at a natural hairline, it’s very soft, like baby hair,” said Dr. Sanusi Umar, an associate instructor of dermatology at the medical school of the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of the new report. “The back of the head is where you find the thickest hair on the head. If you take that hair and use it in the hairline, it can end up looking harsh and pluggy, because the hair is too thick.”\n\nDr. Umar was inspired to develop the procedure in part from personal experience. In 1996, as a medical internist with thinning hair, he underwent a traditional hair transplant procedure but was unhappy with the results. “That inspired me to go into dermatology,” he said. After reading a 2008 report showing it was possible for transplanted leg hair to survive and grow naturally on the back of a man’s head, Dr. Umar realized its potential to create softer, more natural-looking hairlines. “If you transplant leg hair on the head, it’s not going to start acting like head hair. It will still grow shorter and slower than scalp hair,” he said.\n\nAt his clinic in Redondo Beach, Calif., Dr. Umar tried the technique on two patients, one a 35-year-old man who was embarrassed by the results of a traditional hair transplant to restore his hairline. “He was self-conscious about the problem and resorted to styling his hair forward to obscure the hairline,” Dr. Umar wrote in his report. The other patient, a 29-year-old man who had also undergone a traditional transplant, was likewise “unhappy about his hairline, which he felt was too harsh and straight,” Dr. Umar wrote. “He had resorted to cropping his hair short to obscure the problem.”\n\nWith the patients under local anesthesia, Dr. Umar used a device that creates microscopic wounds around hair follicles in the back of the leg; the follicles were then removed and transplanted to the hairline. The hairs were removed in a diffuse pattern, so there were no bald spots on the legs after the procedure. “Because these are very tiny wounds, they heal and close up with minimal scarring,” he said.\n\nIn each case, Dr. Umar and his team extracted about 1,000 leg hair follicles and grafted them, one by one, to the patients’ hairlines. About 75 to 80 percent of the transplanted leg hair grew successfully on the patients’ heads after the operations, and both men were happy with the results, Dr. Umar said. “The hairline was fully grown and soft-looking by nine months” in the 35-year-old, he wrote, “at which time the patient started combing his hair backward and sporting a ponytail, exposing his hairline comfortably.”\n\nSince then, Dr. Umar has done eight more of the procedures, including one in a woman. On average, a procedure involves 1,500 to 1,800 follicles and takes about eight hours, with breaks.\n\nA lot of these patients “have no other options or alternatives,” he added. “They’ve been told to forget about it by many other clinics. It’s life-altering for them when they realize that this is possible.”']","It’s difficult to see how this story passed the New York Times’ “fit to print” test – even on its blog.  The report is observational with a sample of two patients, it misses nearly all of our measures and allows the author of the study to provide readers with a 777 word advertisement.","This story about two patients who underwent a hair transplant using leg hair starts with a problematic premise: that male pattern baldness is a medical condition causing “enormous stress” that needs to be treated with surgery. But even with that framing, this story fails to deliver most of the basic components necessary to provide readers with the necessary tools to make good choices. Benefits and harms are not quantified. The limitations of the research are not discussed. Costs and availability are not explained, and alternatives are not explored. The story reads like a sales pitch, and, it’s no wonder.

1044,story_reviews_00305,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/medical-evidence-for-lumbar-support-runs-counter-to-claims-made-in-u-s-news-world-report-story/,2017-01-05 05:00:00,Can Lumbar Support Devices Relieve Lower Back Pain?,"['On a scale of 1 to 10, lower back pain can register somewhere between ""I need an aspirin"" to “please jack me up with morphine.”\n\nThose suffering from such discomfort might feel moderate to mild pain that is not debilitating. In severe cases, they could feel like a giant electrified claw has claimed the lower part of their back, tearing into each nerve in that part of the body. The smallest of movements – getting up from a chair, walking or even coughing – can feel torturous. Maybe the lower back is as stiff as hardened concrete and as sensitive as an exposed nerve.\n\nA simple lumbar support device, or back brace, can provide short-term relief, research shows, according to an analysis of 28 studies published in the September 2016 issue of the Annals of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine journal. While these devices won’t cure the underlying condition, they\'re simple and relatively inexpensive. In the 2016 meta-analysis, researchers concluded that lumbar support devices are useful for improving function and reducing pain among those suffering from subacute back pain, which means it\'s past the acute stage – which is sudden and short in duration – but not long-lasting enough to be chronic.\n\n“Lumbar support devices provide enough compression and support for the lower back to allow healing to occur,” says Christopher Cousins, a physical therapist based in the District of Columbia. “The compression on the abdomen means there’s less pressure on your lower back discs, ligaments, muscles and spine.”\n\nLumbar devices typically fit around your waist and are secured with Velcro. They often have a steel or plastic plate attached to the section that would press against the patient’s lower back to provide support; some have over-the-shoulders straps. Most over-the-counter lumbar support devices cost between $25 and $130, and they\'re available at many drug stores, Target and Wal-Mart, plus online without a a prescription. Custom-made lumbar support devices, which are contoured to the natural curvature of the patient’s spine, cost from a few hundred dollars to about $1,000, Cousins says.\n\nPeople who suffer mild to moderate subacute back pain should put on a back brace as soon as their discomfort sets in, says Scott Bautch, a chiropractor in Wasau, Wisconsin, and president of the American Chiropractic Association\'s council on occupational health. ""You want to give yourself bracing so you can move,"" Bautch says. ""Inactivity or immobilization is the worst thing for a back. You want to remain active, and a brace can help you do that.""\n\nSome studies have shown that wearing a lumbar support device could lead to negative effects, such as skin lesions, muscle wasting, gastrointestinal disorders, higher blood pressure and higher heart rates. Those issues are rare and typically occur with people who wear a back brace for an extended period of time, for more than the week or two most experts recommend, Bautch says. If a back brace fits well, is worn properly – that is, it\'s not too snug – and is not overused, it shouldn\'t create any health problems, Bautch says. During the course of his 30-year career, Bautch says, hundreds of his patients have worn lumbar support devices. None of them developed any problems, aside from a handful who had minor skin irritation where part of the brace rubbed their body, Bautch says. He remedied that issue by having his patients wear an undershirt between the lumbar support device and their skin.\n\nSearing, subacute back pain is caused by an array of conditions, including a herniated disc, in which the soft, jelly-like center inside the disc pushes out through a tear in its tough exterior and irritates nerves. A herniated disc can cause sciatica, a painful condition that affects the back, hips and legs and is caused by the compression of a spinal nerve root in the lower back. Spinal discs degenerate with age, and a herniated disc can occur without a physical injury, says Dr. Neel Anand, director of spine trauma at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. ""Think of your disc like your car tire – it\'s going to wear out,"" Anand says.\n\nBefore getting a lumbar support device for your lower back pain, experts recommend these steps:\n\n1. If you have severe pain, see a physician quickly. If your back pain or stiffness is so bad you can\'t move without tremendous discomfort, see a doctor as soon as possible, Bautch says. If your pain and stiffness are that severe, a back brace may not be of much immediate use, he says, adding that it may be helpful once the pain and stiffness subside to a tolerable level where you can move.\n\nModerate to mild lower back pain often subsides after five days or so, but if your discomfort persists beyond that or worsens, see a doctor, adds Dr. Megan Cortazzo, medical director of clinical documentation improvement and health information management at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A doctor can test for and rule out serious potential causes, such as kidney stones, an abdominal aneurysm and cancer, Cortazzo says. Doctors can order an array of tests, such as an X-ray, MRI or CT scan, to arrive at the correct diagnosis, which will help lead to the most effective treatment plan, she says. The goal of most treatment regimens is strengthening the patient\'s core muscles supporting the spine so the pain doesn\'t recur. Treatment could include physical therapy, a stretching routine, yoga or Pilates. Many people also find chiropractic adjustments helpful, says Robert Hayden, a chiropractor based in Griffin, Georgia.\n\n2. Find a lumbar support device that fits you. Once you\'ve been diagnosed, look for a lumbar support device that fits the natural curvature of your spine, says Dr. Jeremy Smith, an orthopedic spine surgeon at the Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Irvine, California. Try on a few at the store before buying one, he advises. If you buy the device online, you can return it if it doesn\'t fit. “It needs to naturally contour and fit, kind of like a glove, so all surface areas are in contact with your back. It should help remind you to keep good posture,” Smith says. “The device should be snug, but not too tight. It shouldn’t constrict your breathing.”\n\n3. Don’t become reliant on your back brace. Patients should wear a back brace for no longer than a few days to two weeks at the most, Bautch says. “Longer than that, and your muscles start to adapt and get accustomed to the brace, which means they can lose strength, which can lead to more injuries,” he adds. “If you use the back brace for more than two weeks, you can become brace-dependent.” A lumbar support device can be useful in the short term, but strengthening the core muscles that support your back is important in the long run, Bautch says.\n\n4. Learn your capacity. Figure out your physical limits to avoid reinjuring your back – both when you\'re wearing a back brace and after you\'ve stopped using it, says Robert Shapiro, a physical therapist and certified orthopedic manual therapist based in Huntington, New York. ""You\'re not Superman when you\'re wearing your brace,"" he says. Exceeding your physical boundaries could cause a recurrence of low back pain. “You have to learn what your limits are and not to exceed them,” Shapiro says. “You may be able to lift a box of books, but shoveling snow may cause pain. Your physical limits may change as you exercise and strengthen your core.”']","If research reveals that wearing an inexpensive back brace stands to actually help alleviate pain and accelerate recovery compared to alternatives (e.g. drugs and surgery), it’s newsworthy. That wasn’t the case here.","This U.S. News & World Report story looks at using back braces for lower back pain.
The story does some things well–it discusses the potential harms of back braces, for example, and provides information on how much they cost. But there’s a big problem overall with the story: It claims that a new study—a meta-analysis of 28 different studies that was published in the Annals of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine—shows back braces might provide some sufferers short-term pain relief.
But here’s what the study actually concludes: “To date, there is no proof to prescribe lumbar support in the management of low back pain general population.” What’s more, the story doesn’t explain the study is (at this point) only a brief abstract from a rehabilitative medicine meeting. Such meeting abstracts offer few details on study design, methodology, results, significance, or conclusions — they’re mainly discussion pieces for professionals who gather at meetings, and serve as previews for more fleshed-out research that’s in the works.
This makes the premise of the U.S. News story questionable, and its lack of any meaningful discussion of the study’s details or quality doesn’t help. In effect, the research abstract serves as a weak tool to discuss back pain, back braces, and how and when to seek treatment.

Or hold that, please?","['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Fast food outlets should hand out free cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to their customers to “neutralize” the heart risks of eating fatty foods like burgers and fries, British scientists suggested on Thursday.\n\nThe quadruple bypass cheese burger is displayed at Heart Attack Grill in Chandler, Arizona June 17, 2009. REUTERS/Joshua Lott\n\nBut a few experts say you might want to ask your server to hold the statin at this point.\n\nIn a study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, scientists from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London calculated that the reduction in heart disease risk offered by a statin could offset the increase in risk from eating a cheeseburger and a milkshake.\n\n“Statins don’t cut out all of the unhealthy effects of a burger and fries. It’s better to avoid fatty food altogether. But we’ve worked out that in terms of your likelihood of having a heart attack, taking a statin can reduce your risk to more or less the same degree as a fast food meal increases it,” said Dr. Darrel Francis, who led the research team.\n\n“When people engage in risky behaviors like driving or smoking, they’re encouraged to take measures that minimize their risk, like wearing a seatbelt or choosing cigarettes with filters. Taking a statin is a rational way of lowering some of the risks of eating a fatty meal.”\n\nStill, Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation (BHF) health charity, said Francis’ idea should not be taken too literally. He urged people to focus on maintaining a good diet and taking exercise to keep their hearts healthy.\n\n“Statins are a vital medicine for people with — or at high risk of developing — heart disease,” he said. “They are not a magic bullet.”\n\nA study in June in the Archives of Internal Medicine suggested, in fact, that statins do not save lives in patients without heart disease, although they may prevent some non-fatal heart attacks.\n\nDr. Franz Messerli, the director of the hypertension program at two New York hospitals, St. Luke’s and Roosevelt, worried about the message handing out statins would send to burger-eaters.\n\n“Complimentary statin packets are prone to ... give Quarter Pounder consumers a sense of false security,” he told Reuters Health by email.\n\nWhile statins might combat some of the toll that fatty foods take on cholesterol, there’s a lot they can’t negate: “sodium content is high, fibres are absent, and caloric load gargantuan,” Messerli said of the fast food the authors looked at.\n\nStatins are among the most widely used drugs for the treatment and prevention of heart disease and strokes — the world’s top killers.\n\nOne statin, a generic drug called simvastatin, is already available in low doses over the counter at pharmacies in Britain without a prescription. Other statins such as Pfizer’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca’s Crestor - which are among the biggest-selling drugs in the world — are for prescription only.\n\nIn the U.S., all statins are only available by prescription.\n\n“Although no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, one positive choice to a panoply of negative ones,” the scientists write in their paper.\n\nFrancis’ team — who worked independently and had no funding from the drug or food industries for their research — used data from a previous large study to quantify how a person’s heart attack risk increases with their daily intake of total fat and harmful trans fats.\n\nThey compared this with the decrease in risk from taking statins, using data from seven previously published trials.\n\n“It makes sense to make risk-reducing supplements available just as easily as the unhealthy condiments (such as salt or ketchup) that are provided free of charge,” Francis said in his report of the research. “It would cost less than 5 pence ($0.07) per customer — not much different to a sachet of ketchup.”\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/gak74n American Journal of Cardiology, online August 12, 2010.']",A reasonably balanced news story in response to an unusual article published in a medical journal.  , ,5,real

The rest of us want to know how much we have to exercise to see health benefits. Now we have some answers: You may want to go just a tad longer and harder than you\'d thought.\n\nCurrent government guidelines advise adults to get the equivalent of at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of higher-intensity exercise every week, plus some strength training. In effect, those guidelines say there\'s no particular benefit from working out harder, other than saving time.\n\nTo find out if that\'s true, researchers at Queen\'s University in Ontario studied different combinations of exercise intensity and duration in a group of 300 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity. (That\'s generally defined as a waist circumference of more than 35 inches for women who aren\'t pregnant and more than 40 inches for men.) People with abdominal obesity are at higher risk of heart disease and early death than people with slimmer waistlines.\n\nAll the exercisers were told to work out under supervision five times per week for 24 weeks. One group worked out at low intensity, about 50 percent of maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max, a measure of cardiovascular fitness), for about 31 minutes per session — enough to burn 180 calories for women and 300 for men. That exercise prescription was about the same as in the government guidelines. The intensity was about equivalent to walking slowly, said study author Robert Ross, a kinesiologist at Queen\'s University.\n\nAnother group exercised at the same low intensity but almost twice as long — about 58 minutes on average, or five hours a week, until the women had burned 360 calories and the men 600.\n\nAnd a third group exercised at a higher but still moderate intensity, 75 percent of VO 2 max, until they\'d burned the same number of calories as the second group. That took about 40 minutes a day, or 3.3 hours a week. That intensity was equivalent to brisk walking for the previously sedentary participants, Ross told Shots. (Note that we\'re not talking about the all-out sprints of high-intensity interval training.)\n\nA fourth group was told to do no exercise.\n\nAll the participants were told to keep a food diary and to eat a healthful diet but to keep their calorie intake constant. They also wore accelerometers to track their physical activity during the rest of the day, to make sure the more intense exercisers weren\'t compensating with more time on the sofa.\n\nAt the end of the study, members of all three exercise groups lost an average of about 2 inches from their waist circumference. There weren\'t differences between the three groups. The average exerciser also lost 5 to 6 percent of body weight.\n\n""The take-home message here is that if you\'re consuming a healthful diet and engaging with exercise consistent with the guidelines, you\'re going to see a benefit in your waistline and on the bathroom scale,"" said Ross. The results were published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nBut there was also a benefit from going just a bit faster: Only participants in the higher-intensity group saw an improvement in glucose tolerance, a risk factor for heart disease. (It\'s unclear whether the 9 percent improvement seen will be enough to cut their risk of heart disease, though.)\n\nThe result makes sense, since there\'s some previous evidence suggesting that higher-intensity exercise is tied to improving how the body processes sugar, said Neal Pire, an exercise physiologist who puts together medically based training programs at HNH Fitness in Oradell, N.J., a program of Holy Name Medical Center. Strength training can also improve glucose tolerance, which is why it\'s part of the government guidelines, he told Shots.\n\nCardiovascular fitness also improved in all three groups, but the lower-intensity exercisers who went longer did better than those who went shorter, and the higher-intensity group did better still.\n\nBottom line: All the exercisers improved, but the folks who did the best walked briskly for about 40 minutes five times a week. (Ross suggests you walk as if you\'re late for a bus.) ""It doesn\'t take a lot,"" said Ross. ""That\'s why our participants were so surprised. They didn\'t have to climb Mount Everest.""']","How much is “enough” when it comes to exercise, and is more always better? This NPR story tackles those difficult questions through coverage of a new exercise trial.","This is a solid look at a study of the effects of exercise at different intensities and durations in obese people who were sedentary at the start of the study. The explanation of what the researchers did and what they found is careful, and the take-home messages are reasonable. The story didn’t, however, acknowledge that subjects in the higher-intensity exercise group had a higher rate of injuries that were not trivial.

It is possible, for instance, that patients were referred to stent use because they were too sick to withstand surgery, and that could be an important reason for the higher death rate among those patients.\n\nWilliam Weintraub, chief of cardiology at Christiana Care Health System in Delaware and the study\'s lead investigator, said the results call for more collaboration between heart surgeons who perform bypass surgeries and interventional cardiologists who deploy stents to make sure patients are carefully evaluated and informed of their options before their procedures.\n\nHe cautioned that all of the studies—including the new one—have limitations. ""I don\'t think anybody would say the results will completely change the way we do things,"" said Dr. Weintraub, who presented the results at the annual scientific meeting of the American College of Cardiology. They were also published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe gold standard for testing medical treatments is the randomized trial, in which patients are randomly assigned to a treatment or control group to spread patient differences evenly and avoid bias in results. But such trials typically have strict enrollment criteria and findings often can\'t be generalized to the broader population.\n\nRegistry studies such as the current one enable researchers to use accumulated data on the real-world experience of thousands of patients, but as the current study suggests, that doesn\'t necessarily resolve uncertainty over which treatment approach is better.\n\nThe result ""doesn\'t change much,"" said Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University, who wasn\'t involved in the study. ""It nudges you a little closer to surgery, but it\'s not a very big nudge.""\n\nThe paper is based on data from Medicare beneficiaries included in an American College of Cardiology Foundation registry of patients who got angioplasty and stent procedures and in another database on bypass surgery maintained by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Medicare data are included as well.\n\nResearchers found that at one year after the procedures, death rates were about the same for surgery and stents, reflecting the higher risk of mortality from the open-heart procedure itself—about 2% for surgery compared with about 1% for stenting. The short-term risk of surgery can affect patients\' treatment decision, especially given the prospect of open-heart surgery and weeks of recovery, compared with a less-invasive angioplasty.\n\nThe new data suggest doctors can tell patients if they survive the surgery, they will live longer down the road, said Michael Crawford, clinical cardiology chief at University of California at San Francisco, who wasn\'t involved in the study. ""Some patients buy that. For some it\'s a tough sell.""\n\nThe patients studied had heart disease in two or three of the vessels that provide blood to the heart. They were stable, and thus didn\'t need a procedure urgently. Currently, such patients could be candidates for either approach.\n\nKirk Garratt, director of research at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York and an interventional cardiologist who wasn\'t involved in the study, said patients who choose stents shouldn\'t think they\'re ""making a dreadful mistake"" about their care based on the new data.\n\nBut Fred Edwards, emeritus professor of surgery at University of Florida, Jacksonville, and a co-author of the study, said he thought the results favoring surgery ""should influence practice.""\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com']",This thoroughly reported and clearly written piece came out on top compared to competing stories by the ,"Readers needed a thoughtful look at what at first glance appeared to be a massive amount of evidence supporting a more invasive approach to heart treatment. This story carefully put the findings in perspective. Unlike competing coverage, the story did not encourage readers to opt for surgery but more likely will result in more patients having frank conversations with their physicians before deciding on a treatment plan.

Some look for proteins in the blood that appear with cancer. Others more recently have focused on DNA from tumors. But these methods alone don\'t give reliable results.\n\nSo Nickolas Papadopoulos, a professor of oncology and pathology at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, collaborated with many colleagues at the medical school to develop a new approach. It combines two methods into one test.\n\nTheir experimental test, dubbed CancerSEEK, focuses on eight major cancers: lung, breast, colon, pancreas, liver, stomach, ovary and esophagus.\n\n""We selected those eight cancers based on how frequent they are, also [because] a lot of them do not have any screening modality right now,"" Papadopoulos says.\n\nThe researchers looked at 1,005 people who had been diagnosed with these cancers. The blood test found signs of cancer in about 70 percent of them.\n\nThey also looked at 812 people without cancer diagnoses and found just seven of them — less than 1 percent — apparently had a false reading that found cancer. A low false-positive rate is critical for any test that could be used widely to screen people for cancer.\n\nOf course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven\'t already been diagnosed. And that percentage could well be lower than the 70 percent average. For example, the test was successful only about 40 percent of the time in the patients the researchers studied with the earliest stage 1 cancers.\n\nThough 40 percent success would be far from ideal, ""we still think this is a very important milestone in detecting cancers in asymptomatic people,"" Papadopoulos says. ""That could save their life.""\n\n""I am incredibly excited by this new paper,"" says Joshua Schiffman, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Huntsman Cancer Center at the University of Utah who was not involved in the study. ""This is the paper that\'s going to set the field in motion.""\n\nBut Schiffman points out that there are many issues to work out – even assuming the test proves reliable among people who have not been previously diagnosed with cancer. For instance, if the success rate is around 40 percent at detecting cancer, that means it misses cancers more often than it finds it.\n\n""The thing we worry about quite often is ... if we have a test result that is negative we don\'t want to give false reassurance to the patient,"" he says. He is concerned that patients will think to themselves, ""Even though I have this weird stomach pain that won\'t go away, I know it\'s not cancer. I\'m not going to go to the doctor because the CancerSEEK test told me it was negative,"" Schiffman says. ""And that would be a terrible thing.""\n\nAnother problem is that the test results find signs of cancer, but often fail to pinpoint which part of the body is affected. ""That\'s a tremendous problem that has to be overcome,"" he says.\n\n""We\'ve come about one step in a thousand-mile journey,"" says Vinay Prasad, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Oregon Health and Science University who was not involved in the study.\n\nFirst, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys.\n\nAnd for the test to be useful, ""you\'ve got to find cancer that\'s going to otherwise be lethal, and not cancer that would otherwise be destined to do nothing,"" Prasad says.\n\nThat\'s been a huge problem with previous cancer screening tests, especially for prostate cancer and breast cancer, and has led to pointless and potentially dangerous treatments, he says.\n\nAn effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.\n\n""We want this to be true, we hope that this is true, but we have learned through 30, 40, 50 years of cancer screening that we have to do the right studies at the outset to know that it\'s true,"" Prasad says.\n\nThe scientists at Hopkins have already launched their next study, which could involve tens of thousands of apparently healthy volunteers who are enrolled in the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania. Their experience will help answer the next big question, which is whether CancerSEEK will pick up cancer in people who don\'t have symptoms.\n\nIf that multiyear experiment succeeds, the researchers will still have to demonstrate that the test improves and extends the lives of cancer patients.\n\nPapadopoulos is less concerned that the test could detect cancers that might not in fact benefit from treatment.\n\n""In a personal level, I do want to know,"" he says. ""That doesn\'t mean I have to go and have a surgery. However, I still think this is very useful information, knowing that something is happening and follow it up.""\n\nAs for the cost of the test, Papadopoulos says the research team has tried hard to make it affordable. They\'re hoping to make it economical, so that each test could cost about $500. But he says Johns Hopkins holds the patent and has not licensed it as yet to a company that would ultimately set the price.\n\nYou can contact Richard Harris: rharris@npr.org.']","The story places the study evidence, benefits vs. risks, and important limitations in a real-world context.","This story is an overview of a preliminary, experimental test to screen for eight types of cancer.

The ideal study would randomly assign women to have mammograms or not. But, cancer experts said, no one would do such a study today when mammograms are generally agreed to prevent breast cancer deaths. In the study, which is continuing, women were followed for a maximum of 8.9 years. It is possible that benefits may emerge later.\n\nNonetheless, the new study is “very credible,” said Dr. Barnett Kramer, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health .\n\n“This is the first time researchers used real populations to compare the effects of treatment and mammography in the modern era of treatment,” Dr. Kramer said. “It shows the relative impacts of screening versus therapy in an era in which therapy has been improving.”\n\nDr. Otis Brawley of the American Cancer Society said in a statement that the investigators used “careful methodology.” The society, Dr. Brawley said, “believes that the total body of the science supports the fact that regular mammography is an important part of a woman’s preventive health care .”\n\nDr. Carol Lee, a radiologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and chairwoman of the breast imaging commission of the American College of Radiology, said the new study affirmed that mammography saves lives.\n\n“Mortality from breast cancer is decreasing, and I have to believe that screening mammography has played a part,” Dr. Lee said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn their study, the investigators analyzed data from all 40,075 Norwegian women who had received a diagnosis of breast cancer from 1986 to 2005, a time when treatment was changing markedly.\n\nIn that period, 4,791 women died. And, starting in 1996, Norway began offering mammograms to women ages 50 to 69 and assigning multidisciplinary treatment teams to all women with breast cancer, similar to the teams at many major medical centers in the United States . The question was, Did the program of mammograms and optimal new treatment with coordinated teams of surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists and nurses lower the breast cancer death rate?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe investigators found that women 50 to 69 who had mammograms and were treated by the special teams had a 10 percent lower breast cancer death rate than similar women who had had neither.\n\nThey also found, though, that the death rate fell by 8 percent in women over 70 who had the new treatment teams but had not been invited to have mammograms. And Dr. Kramer said he knew of no evidence that breast cancer was more easily treated in women over 70 than in women ages 50 to 69.\n\nThat means, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth wrote in an additional analysis in an accompanying editorial, that mammography could have reduced the breast cancer death rate by as little as 2 percent, an amount so small that it is not really different from zero.\n\nTwo percent is an estimate, Dr. Welch said. But, he said, whatever the effect of mammograms is, “all the signals here are that it is much smaller than we believed.”\n\nDr. Laura Esserman, a professor of surgery and radiology at the University of California in San Francisco , said it tells her that “if you get the same treatment and the outcome is the same if you find it earlier or later, then you don’t make a difference when you find it early.”\n\nAnd screening has a cost, Dr. Welch said. Screening 2,500 50-year-olds for a decade would identify 1,000 women with at least one suspicious mammogram resulting in follow-up tests. Five hundred would have biopsies. And 5 to 15 of those women would be treated for cancers that, if left alone, would have grown so slowly they would never have been noticed.\n\nWhen the study was planned, the scientists expected that screening would be even more effective than it was in studies from decades ago. After all, mammography had improved and, in Norway, each mammogram was independently read by two radiologists, which should make it less likely that cancers would be missed. The researchers expected mammograms to reduce the breast cancer death rate by a third.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We were surprised,” said Dr. Mette Kalager, the lead author of the paper who is a breast surgeon at Oslo University and a visiting scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nMarvin Zelen, a statistician at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who was a member of the research team said even though the mammography benefit is small, if he were a woman he would get screened.\n\n“It all depends on how you approach risk,” Dr. Zelen said. His approach, he says, is “minimax” — he wants to minimize the maximum risk — which, in this case, is dying of a cancer.\n\nDr. Kalager came to the opposite conclusion. She worries about the small chance of benefit in light of the larger chance of finding and treating a cancer that did not need to be treated.\n\n“Since I’m a breast cancer surgeon, I know what being treated is like,” she says. The decision to be screened, she says, “is a matter of personal preference. Is it worth it to risk becoming a patient without it being necessary?”\n\nMany women may still want mammograms, she says, and that is fine.\n\n“I think we have to respect what women want to do.”""]",Terrific sourcing is the highlight of this story – with quotes or excerpts from seven different sources.  ,"



 
This story offers readers a comprehensive overview of the study of screening mammography in Norway. It clearly explains how this study is different from earlier examinations of the effect of mammography, so that readers can get a better understanding of why the results of this latest study are different from what has been reported in the past.
This story does a good job of presenting the comments of experts who have different interpretations of the results of the study, so that readers can see their conclusions in context, rather than just a “he-said-she-said” argument.
The story also highlights the role of the multidisciplinary treatment teams available to all the women who were screened with mammography in Norway, thus making clear that screening is just one component of a overall approach to dealing with breast cancer.

Without enough data that could be pooled together, it wasn\'t possible for the Cochrane folks to figure out if anything really works reliably and safely.\n\nMorning sickness is quite common, with most pregnant women getting nauseous early on and around a third throwing up.\n\nUnfortunately, medicines to relieve morning sickness have a checkered history. Remember thalidomide? In the late \'50s the drug was billed as a way to ameliorate morning sickness. The medicine, though never approved for use in the United States, led to birth defects in some 10,000 kids in Europe and Canada.\n\nIn the latest look at various treatments, the Cochrane group evaluated studies that examined both pharmaceutical and alternative techniques, including acupuncture, acupressure (a noninvasive variation of acupuncture), ginger, vitamin B-6 and conventional anti-vomiting drugs.\n\nThe studies in the review comprised more than 4,000 women who were up to 20 weeks pregnant.\n\nSounds impressive, right? But Matthews says reviewers found few high-quality studies about any treatment. Also, inconsistencies in methodology from study to study made it difficult to pool the results and draw firm conclusions.\n\nTake ginger. Matthews says different studies used different forms of ginger -- some tried ginger syrup and others used capsules -- at different doses. The comparison groups in the experiments varied as well.\n\nWhat\'s more, ""people tended to measure the outcomes very differently,"" Matthews says. Most focused on the symptoms of nausea and vomiting, but they measured the symptoms at different times, she says.\n\nAnd here\'s a biggie: There wasn\'t much information about adverse effects on women and babies, something everyone would certainly want to know. And there wasn\'t much hard data on psychological, social or economic outcomes, according to the report.\n\nAuthors of the review found some evidence that ginger, vitamin B-6 and anti-vomiting drugs relieved nausea. But Matthews says the evidence isn\'t strong enough to make a recommendation.\n\nAll too often, Matthews says, researchers in the field seem to forge ahead without paying enough attention to what\'s been done before. ""The onus is back to researchers to carry out studies that would stand up"" to rigorous review and that would build on what\'s already been tested.']","More stories need to take advantage of Cochrane Library reviews, as this one did in discussing treatments for morning sickness. At the same time, the key components of any good story — cost information, hard data and independent voices — should not be overlooked.","We wish more stories focused their coverage on the lack of good evidence supporting commonly used medical treatments, as this NPR story about remedies for morning sickness did.

Such a diet might include minimally processed oatmeal, almonds, brown rice, beans and healthy fats like olive oil, among other foods.\n\nThe study was led by researchers at the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children\'s Hospital and funded by the National Institutes of Health and the New Balance Foundation, which is affiliated with the athletic-shoe maker. It was designed to assess how each of three common diets affects the ability to keep weight off. Participants had all of their food prepared for them, and their food intake was monitored. They ate many meals at the hospital, picking up others to eat at home.\n\nStudy participants following a low-glycemic index diet, which is similar to Mediterranean diet and focuses on fruit, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, also saw improved cholesterol levels. Reuters\n\nDavid Ludwig, one of the study\'s authors and the director of the center, explained that most people struggle to keep weight off. Previous studies have shown that weight loss reduces the body\'s daily energy expenditure—or how many calories the body burns through activity and just by resting—making it easy to regain weight. Dr. Ludwig\'s study was designed to look at the impact of the three diets on measures of energy expenditure, in addition to assessing hormones, fat levels in the blood and other health markers.\n\nThe study\'s 21 participants, 18 to 40 years old, initially lost 10% to 15% of their body weight during a three-month diet that contained about 45% of total calories from carbohydrates, 30% from fat and 25% from protein.\n\nA month later, participants were placed on one of three diets for a month: a low-fat diet limiting fats to 20% of total calories; a low-carbohydrate diet modeled on the Atkins diet, limiting carbohydrate intake to 10% of total calories; and a low-glycemic-index diet, which contained 40% of total calories from carbohydrates, 40% from fats and 20% from protein. Participants were then switched to the other two diets during two additional four-week periods.\n\n""The low-fat diet had the worst effect"" on energy expenditure, Dr. Ludwig said. Participants on that diet also had increases in triglycerides, a type of fat, and lower levels of so-called good cholesterol. ""We should avoid severely restricting any major nutrient and focus on the quality of the nutrient,"" he said.\n\nDr. Ludwig said those on the low-carb diet had the biggest boost in total energy expenditure, burning about 300 calories more per day than those on the low-fat diet—about the same as an hour of moderate exercise. But that bump came at a cost: increases in cortisol, a stress hormone, and a measure of inflammation called CRP, which can raise the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes.\n\nThose on the low-glycemic-index diet burned about 150 calories a day more than those on the low-fat diet without any negative impacts on cholesterol levels or various hormones, making it the ideal diet, Dr. Ludwig said. The glycemic index measures the impact of carbohydrates on blood-sugar levels.\n\nA second study in the same medical journal showed that people in an 18-month weight-loss program that started with monthly meetings lost nearly as much weight as those in a much costlier program of the same duration with group sessions that initially met weekly. That study, led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, found that the monthly program cut about $600 off the cost of a $1,360 traditional weight-loss program with the weekly classes.Members of the group taking monthly classes were mailed the same material as those who attended classes weekly, and those who failed to meet weight-loss goals could get individual counseling by phone or in person.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Corbett Dooren at jennifer.corbett-dooren@dowjones.com']",No caveats or independent perspective in this Wall Street Journal post. The competing ,"This story laid out the basic facts about a study that compared the metabolic effects of diets containing differing amounts of fat, protein, and carbohydrate. But we think it started off on the wrong foot.  The headline is scientifically incorrect.  All calories are equal (1 Kcalorie equals 4.2 K joules).  The story also notes, “A diet based on healthy carbohydrates—rather than a low-fat or low-carbohydrate diet—offers the best chance of keeping weight off without bringing unwanted side effects, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests.”  That is not what the authors concluded, “In conclusion, our study demonstrates that commonly consumed diets can affect metabolism and components of the metabolic syndrome in markedly different ways during weight-loss maintenance, independent of energy content.”
We don’t think the story conveyed that this topic is hotly debated by researchers, and that there is other important evidence that deserves consideration when planning a weight loss strategy. Soliciting an independent perspective would have helped bring that evidence to readers’ attention..

1100,story_reviews_01491,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3020/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,New Test for Brain Injury on Horizon,"['One of the most frustrating aspects of brain injuries is that they can be difficult to diagnose; emergency rooms can sometimes miss subtle symptoms, leading to improper treatment and potentially catastrophic consequences. Now, researchers are close to identifying so-called biomarkers that may soon make it possible to pinpoint brain injuries with a simple blood test.\n\nPresence of these biomarkers—proteins produced by an injured brain—could end up determining the future treatment of the estimated 1.4 million athletes, car-crash victims and others in the U.S. who are treated for brain injuries in emergency rooms each year, in addition to hundreds of thousands of soldiers injured in blasts.\n\nA Look at Head Trauma About 1.7 million people annually in the U.S. suffer a traumatic brain injury. Some can lead to long-term difficulties in functioning.\n\nMost common causes among civilians are falls, car crashes and assaults. Blasts can cause brain injuries in soldiers.\n\nAbout 75% of brain injuries are concussions or ""mild"" brain injuries.\n\n52,000 people in U.S. die from brain injuries annually, and 275,000 are hospitalized.\n\nMost commonly affected age groups are children up to 4 years old, and teens 15 to 19.\n\nMore than 3 million Americans have long-term need for help in daily tasks because of brain injury. Sources: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Brain Injury Association of America; WSJ interviews.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department is soon expected to provide $17 million to fund a major study of brain-injury biomarkers in more than 1,000 human patients at 20 hospitals in the U.S. and overseas. The first-of-its-kind study—which is expected to start next year and take 18 months—will explore whether biomarkers can reliably assess the extent of brain injury and help doctors decide on treatment.\n\n""I think this will revolutionize brain-injury care,"" says Col. Dallas Hack, a medical doctor in charge of the U.S. Army\'s combat casualty treatment. He says the Army\'s goal is to one day have a portable blood-test device that a medic could carry onto the battlefield.\n\nDoctors frequently fail to diagnose brain injury in patients who\'ve suffered head trauma but remain conscious. Physicians also sometimes can\'t reliably determine whether a patient in a stupor has a brain injury, a stroke, or something else entirely. As a result, doctors may incorrectly prescribe treatment, or prescribe no treatment where it\'s actually necessary.\n\nActress Natasha Richardson died last year after hitting her head in a snow-skiing accident partly because the severity of her injury wasn\'t recognized quickly enough for her to get proper treatment. Soldiers on the battlefield can appear fine after enduring an explosion but may in fact need rest, treatment or rehabilitation.\n\nDoctors struggle with diagnoses of brain injuries as they once did with diagnoses of heart attacks. Then cardiologists found troponin, a cardiac biomarker that shows up in blood after a heart attack. A blood test helps doctors assess within an hour or two whether a patient with chest pains is actually having an attack. It\'s more precise than having a patient describe symptoms.\n\nBiomarkers could do the same for brain injury. Researchers are optimistic about work being done at Banyan Biomarkers Inc., a privately held start-up run by former faculty members of the University of Florida.\n\nAt the company\'s lab in Alachua, Fla., anesthetized rats encased in tiny body armor are hit in the head with miniature metal pistons and air blasts. The blows simulate the impacts of accidents or explosions that injure the brain. When the rats awaken, scientists test their blood for the presence of proteins produced by an injured brain.\n\nSo far, evidence from lab animals like these and more than 300 human brain-injury patients suggests strong correlations between the degree of brain injury and the level of certain brain biomarkers. Banyan hopes to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration for a blood test, if the planned clinical study being funded by the Defense Department proves successful.\n\nEdward D. Hall, director of the University of Kentucky\'s brain-injury research program, says the Banyan work does show these biomarkers can reliably track brain injury, and they are found in brain tissue and cerebro-spinal fluid at high enough levels to be reliably detected. But, he said, ""the question is whether they do this in a reliable way in mild injury cases"" through simple blood tests. Other scientists say that Banyan\'s work may help doctors distinguish between different types of brain injury.\n\nA peer-reviewed study of 66 patients led by Banyan scientists and published this year in the journal Critical Care Medicine showed that patients with the most severe brain injury had levels of a biomarker called UCH-L1 that were 16 times the level found in patients without brain injury.\n\nBanyan scientists this year also published conclusions in the European Journal of Neuroscience that the same chemical, UCH-L1, was sharply elevated in rats with injuries designed to mimic both brain injury and stroke.\n\nBanyan\'s president and founder, Ronald L. Hayes, says brain injury isn\'t just an immediate injury, but a disease process that can last for days. During that time, a cascade of biomarker proteins is produced in the brain, suggesting damage continues to occur. Dr. Hayes and his colleagues theorize that early intervention could halt much of this later harm.\n\nBrain injuries are now diagnosed and assessed by checking vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure, then by doctors\' checking the patient\'s thinking, memory and consciousness. They test basic brain functions by checking the size of pupils and how the pupils react to a bright light. They administer pinpricks or other pain or heat stimuli, as well as checking the patient\'s ability to move arms and legs. CT scans are also used.\n\nEarly detection of biomarkers could be particularly helpful at smaller hospitals where doctors might not be trained to deal with a severe brain injury. If they realized through a simple blood test that they confronted a potentially devastating injury, they might rush the patient to a hospital that has a neuro-intensive care unit. There, specialists could place pressure monitors in the brain and lessen intra-cranial pressure that can destroy brain tissue. They also could alleviate ""vasospasms,"" storms within the brain that can be just as damaging as the original injury.\n\nWrite to Thomas M.

Bukaty/AP Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\nVisit an urban park in China any given morning or late afternoon, and you\'re likely to find elderly people engaged in a slow, elegant dance, their arms and legs lifting and circling in unison. Tinny traditional music might be playing from a battery-run cassette player. The seniors are focused and at ease in their daily ritual, and it\'s soothing to watch them.\n\nThe movement is tai chi, an ancient martial art turned exercise, and a study out this week in Archives of Internal Medicine says it may help people suffering from heart failure feel better about life. In a quality of life questionnaire the researchers gave out, those who practiced tai chi scored significantly higher than those who hadn\'t been doing the movement. The tai chi group also reported an improvement in mood.\n\nHeart failure is a tough disease to live with; the shortness of breath and low energy that can come because the heart can\'t pump enough blood make physical activity unappealing. ""Historically, patients with chronic systolic heart failure were considered too frail to exercise and, through the late 1980s, avoidance of physical activity was a standard recommendation,"" the study\'s authors write.\n\nThe Chinese developed tai chi thousands of years ago, but it has recently piqued the interest of Western medicine as an alternative mind-body therapy to treat disease. According to a Harvard Medical School newsletter, tai chi is increasingly seen as a form of \'medication in motion.\'\n\nIt\'s been shown to be useful in treating a wide range of diseases from breast cancer to Parkinson\'s. The National Institutes of Health has also jumped on board and is funding a variety of studies on tai chi for chronic disease.\n\nThe Archives of Internal Medicine study is the first large clinical trial to look at whether a tai chi program can do anything for people with heart failure. The researchers recruited 100 people with the chronic condition from heart clinics in Boston. About half were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week tai chi exercise program. The other half got a heart health education program.\n\nThe tai chi program started off with some traditional warm-up exercises of arm swinging, gentle stretches, breathing, and visualization techniques. Then patients learned five simple movements designed to release tension in the body, increase awareness of breathing, and relax the body and mind. Patients got an instructional video tape, and were encouraged to practice at home at least 3 times a week.\n\nThe study authors say there\'s a usually a strong relationship between depression and heart failure, so the fact that tai chi helped cheer people up was an especially good sign.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">We recognize that quick-hit blog posts won’t always be able to satisfy all ten of our criteria.

Proponents say it eliminates the need for a second hospital stay and grueling rehabilitation period, reduces time spent under anesthesia and costs less.\n\nSome studies have found no difference in complication rates after bilateral surgery compared with unilateral surgery. A 2013 study in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery estimated the cost of bilateral surgery at $43,401 compared with $72,233 for two separate surgeries staged over time. The study concluded that bilateral surgery is more cost-effective with better outcomes for the average patient than staged procedures for two knees.\n\nBut more recent studies have found increased rates of complication such as blood clots that travel to the lung, an increased need for blood transfusions, and a higher risk of death with the bilateral procedure.\n\nThe rate of knee replacements in the U.S. almost doubled from 2000 through 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and now exceeds 700,000 procedures a year. The CDC doesn’t break out data, but studies indicate the percentage of patients who had both knees replaced at the same time has risen from less than 4% in 1999 to more than 6% at present.\n\nKen McLaughlin, 63, had bilateral knee replacement surgery in October 2014; he spent three nights in the hospital, about a week in a rehabilitation clinic and took a three-month leave from work. He experienced pain but no complications. Photo: Ken McLaughlin\n\nSimultaneous bilateral procedures can be performed either by two surgeons operating in tandem or by a single surgeon who completes one knee and immediately turns to the other.\n\nAlthough the average age has dropped for patients getting knee surgery, many also have health issues that can increase the risk of complications. In 2013, a consensus group of experts recommended that surgeons use more restrictive criteria to select patients for double knee replacements and exclude those with high cardiac risks. The majority said patients who aren’t candidates for simultaneous procedures should get a second one no sooner than three months after the first.\n\n“We’ve learned a lot from years of data on who has complication issues,” says Steven Haas, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. The hospital avoids bilateral knee surgery in patients who have any type of heart disease, as well as those with a body mass index of 40 or more. Obese patients often have conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure than can complicate surgery. Typically, Dr. Haas says, he doesn’t perform bilateral surgery in patients over 80, and prefers not to do it in those over 75 unless they are in exceptional health.\n\nFor healthy patients in their 50s and 60s, “it’s an elective decision,” Dr. Haas says.\n\nSandra Lynch, a 62-year-old wedding officiant in Frederick, Md., had trouble with her knees for more than a decade before getting bilateral knee replacement surgery in December 2014. She says she has no regrets. Photo: Sandra Lynch\n\nNicholas Grosso, president of the Centers for Advanced Orthopaedics in Bethesda, Md., performs bilateral surgery in tandem with another surgeon. A typical hospital stay is three days, compared with two days for single-knee surgery. New anesthetic techniques help control pain after surgery, and as many as 40% of his bilateral patients go directly home. Others go to a rehabilitation facility for about a week, which isn’t usually necessary for unilateral patients. Dr. Grosso says overall recovery time is typically the same, with full recovery in about four months.\n\nKen McLaughlin, 63, had a bilateral knee replacement surgery in October 2014, with Dr. Grosso and a colleague, M. Brian Polsky. Mr. McLaughlin, who was an avid basketball player and volleyball coach, now teaches physical education to developmentally disabled children. Despite several surgeries over the years to repair damage, he had constant pain in both knees. Yet he wanted to put replacement off, he says, “until I couldn’t stand it anymore.”\n\nAfter consulting with Dr. Grosso, he decided on bilateral surgery. First, he spent several months getting ready by building up strength in his legs and hamstrings.\n\nMr. McLaughlin, who lives in Laurel, Md., says it “really hurt” at first after surgery but he stopped taking pain medication after two days. After three nights in the hospital, he spent about a week in a rehabilitation clinic and took a leave from work until mid-January, working out twice a day for an hour and walking around his house. He had no complications and works out at the gym three times weekly. “I’m feeling stronger and getting ready to snow ski this winter,” he says.\n\nA study in May in the Journal of Arthroplasty compared cases matched for risks in simultaneous bilateral and unilateral knee surgeries in a database of nearly 44,000 patients. It found no significant difference in the rate of complications including infection, hospital re-admission, or death. But bilateral procedures were associated with increased overall complications and risk of subsequent surgery within 30 days.\n\nStudy co-author David Manning, a joint replacement specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago and associate professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, says he recommends staged procedures over time for patients who need both knees replaced. He doesn’t perform bilateral knee replacements.\n\n“We decided it is not a safe practice, and it adds risk, so we don’t do it,” he says.\n\nLast year, a large study comparing the two types of surgery indicated that bilateral patients were at increased risk of both minor and major in-hospital complications as well as death. The study, published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, included hospital claims data on 24,574 simultaneous bilateral surgeries and 382,496 unilateral procedures.\n\nSurgeon Bryan Springer, a co-author of the study and fellowship director at OrthoCarolina Hip and Knee Center in Charlotte, N.C., says while complication rates are generally low for all knee surgeries, he is “extremely selective” about recommending bilateral surgery. “If you pick your patient appropriately you can do this operation very safely,” he says. Dr. Springer performs bilateral surgery with a team, starting the second knee while the first incision is being closed; if there are safety concerns after the first, he won’t proceed with the second.\n\nSandra Lynch, a 62-year-old wedding-officiant in Frederick, Md., had trouble with her knees for more than a decade. But with a busy schedule, she didn’t want recovery to take more than four months. Before the procedure, she took a year to exercise, walking daily and building a desk over a disassembled recumbent bike. She had the bilateral knee replacement with Dr. Grosso and Dr. Polsky in December last year.\n\nAfterward, Ms. Lynch was hospitalized for four days. She needed a blood transfusion but was able to manage physical therapy before being transferred to a rehabilitation center for about a week. After bad reactions to narcotic pain medications and an anti-nausea patch, she switched to over-the-counter painkillers. Though she had to use a walker at first, after eight weeks she began to drive and walk without assistance. She is now back to work officiating at weddings and says she has no regrets.\n\nWrite to Laura Landro at laura.landro@wsj.com']",A 5-star effort that covers most of what we think readers need in a news story.

Credit: Pete Hausler/The Wall Street Journal
This installment of the Wall Street Journal’s “Informed Patient” feature looks at the risks and benefits of bilateral knee replacement surgery (in which both knees are replaced during the same operation) as compared to staged knee replacement surgery (in which the knees are replaced during separate surgeries, usually months apart). While the story finds that it can be less expensive and time-consuming to have the bilateral knee replacement, it also reports that bilateral replacement surgery may pose increased health risks for patients.
The coverage overall is thorough and gives readers a good sense of the tradeoffs involved with each approach. The inclusion of more details about the “better outcomes” achieved in some studies of bilateral replacement would have been a valuable addition to the piece.

Flu patch may take sting out of your fears\n\nIn what would be a boon for needle-phobes of all ages, researchers have developed a skin patch that vaccinates against the flu and could be available in five years.\n\nThe patch, which is lined with microscopic needles that dissolve into the skin, could provide a painless alternative to hypodermic needles and make visits to the doctor\'s office or clinic for a traditional flu shot a thing of the past. The patch is as easy to apply as a Band-Aid.\n\n""We\'ve now demonstrated a technology that can enable painless, self-administered flu vaccination,"" said Mark Prausnitz, a professor in the Georgia Tech School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and leader in the research. ""It appears to vaccinate against influenza at least as well and probably better than a traditional hypodermic needle.""\n\nVaccination that doesn\'t require trained personnel holds great appeal because it would likely boost the nation\'s low immunization rates, a source of concern.\n\nAlthough influenza kills more than 30,000 people most years and the government recommends most healthy people get vaccinated annually, fewer than 40 percent typically do.\n\nTested on mice\n\nIn a mouse study reported Sunday in the online edition of Nature Medicine, Prausnitz\'s team found the patch improved the immune system\'s antibody memory and was more efficient at clearing the lungs of the flu virus, compared to a placebo and hypodermic needle-delivered vaccine.\n\nPrausnitz attributed the better performance to the skin\'s abundance of the types of cells most adept at generating immune responses. The muscle into which needles deliver vaccine is not nearly as active immunologically.\n\nPatches in the mouse study contained an array of 100 needles, each some 650 microns in length, or about the width of a few strands of human hair. Coated with inactivated flu virus, the patches are pressed manually into the skin, where the microneedles dissolve into bodily fluids.\n\n""It\'s a technological approach that makes a lot of sense,"" said Dr. Jan Drutz, a general pediatrician at Texas Children\'s Hospital who calls needle-phobia common in both kids and adults. ""It would be a wonderful alternative to needles if it truly works in people and is pain free.""\n\nFights flu better\n\nNeedle-phobia, or trypanophobia, is a recognized medical condition that causes sufferers to avoid medical care. It is estimated to affect more than 10 percent of the adult population.\n\nIn the study, one group of mice received the influenza vaccine from traditional hypodermic needles; another group received the vaccine through the dissolving microneedles; and a control group received the microneedle patches not containing any vaccine.\n\nInfected with the influenza virus 30 days later, both groups that received the vaccine remained healthy while mice in the control group contracted the flu and died.\n\nThree months after vaccination, researchers exposed a different group of immunized mice to the flu virus and found that those who received the microneedles did better than those injected by the hypodermic needles.\n\nTesting on people next\n\nNoting that mice are much easier to vaccinate against the flu than humans, Baylor College of Medicine influenza expert Dr. Paul Glezen expressed skepticism about the patch until seeing it in human trials. But he said it will be interesting to watch.\n\nPrausnitz said he hopes to be testing the patch in people in two years and have a product on the shelves in five. He also said that although initially there will be start-up costs, he thinks the price will be no more than traditional flu vaccines once it is mass-produced.\n\nThe microneedle technology may also be used for other vaccinations, such as polio and measles, said Prausnitz. He said his team is working on those diseases but is not as far along.\n\ntodd.ackerman@chron.com']",Like the competing ,"That statement may be true for mice, but the patch vaccine has never even been tested–let alone been proven effective–in humans.

""It\'s estimated more than a billion people globally suffer from high blood pressure with the vast majority having poorly controlled blood pressure. Our results could help millions of people globally reduce their blood pressure and reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke.""\n\nThe researchers tested an entirely new way of treating hypertension by giving patients three drugs, each at half dose, in a single pill for early treatment of high blood pressure. Traditionally patients begin treatment with one drug at a very low dose, which is increased over time with additional drugs added and increased in dosage to try to reach target.\n\nDr Webster added: ""Patients are brought back at frequent intervals to see if they are meeting their targets with multiple visits required to tailor their treatments and dosage. This is not only time inefficient, it\'s costly. We also know that many doctors and patients find it too complicated and often don\'t stick to the process. This new approach is much simpler and it works.""\n\nThe trial, which was conducted in Sri Lanka, enrolled 700 patients with an average age of 56 and blood pressure of 154/90 mm Hg.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either the combination pill or usual care - their doctor\'s choice of blood pressure lowering medication. The Triple Pill, consisted of the blood pressure medications telmisartan (20 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), and chlorthalidone (12.5 mg).\n\nCompared with patients receiving usual care, a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving the Triple Pill achieved their target blood pressure of 140/90 or less (with lower targets of 130/80 for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease).\n\nAt six months, 83 percent of participants in the Triple Pill group were still receiving the combination pill compared to the majority of patients in the usual-care group still receiving only one and only one third receiving two or more blood-pressure-lowering drugs.\n\nProfessor Anushka Patel, Principal Investigator of the trial and Chief Scientist at The George Institute, said this was big improvement. ""The World Heart Federation has set an ambitious goal that by 2025 there will be a 25 per cent reduction in blood pressure levels globally. The Triple Pill could be a low cost way of helping countries around the world to meet this target.\n\n""This study has global relevance. While the most pressing need, from the perspective of the global burden of disease, is low-and middle-income countries, it\'s equally relevant in a country like Australia where we\'re still achieving only 40%-50% control rates for high blood pressure.""\n\nThe George Institute is now looking at strategies to maximise uptake of the study results. This includes examining the acceptability of the Triple Pill approach to patients and their doctors, as well as cost-effectiveness which will be important for governments and other payers to consider.\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia as part of the Global Alliance for Chronic Disease.']",The news release buried the news that the combo pill offered modest improvement over standard treatment but didn’t reduce side effects significantly.,"This news release does a nice job of explaining the basic design of a study investigating whether a once-daily “triple pill” (that combines 3 different blood pressure-lowering medications) is more effective in lowering blood pressure than doctors’ usual approach.
But there’s plenty of room for improvement here including: presenting the findings in a more meaningful context for patients, including the substantial adverse outcomes noted by the researchers, and using much more toned down language for results that are neither novel or all that significant.
Notably, there is a significant financial conflict of interest involving the authors. This should have been made clear to readers.

Researchers said that in some cases MRI findings of additional cancers not seen on mammography may necessitate a change in treatment.\n\nBreast MRI is the most sensitive technique for the detection of breast cancer, with widespread application in the screening of high-risk patients and pre-surgical planning. In younger women and women with dense breasts, MRI is effective in the detection of what are known as multicentric cancers, meaning breast cancers involving two or more distinct primary tumors, usually in different quadrants of the breast. However, there has been some debate about the clinical significance of multicentric cancers found with MRI.\n\n""Patients with clinically insignificant cancers undergoing potential overtreatment versus patients who may be undertreated is at the heart of the controversy surrounding breast MRI,"" said the study\'s lead author Chiara Iacconi, M.D., from the Breast Unit at USL1 Massa-Carrara in Carrara, Italy.\n\nTo learn more, Dr. Iacconi and colleagues reviewed records from 2,021 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer who underwent biopsy after preoperative MRI. Of the 2,021 patients, 285, or 14 percent, had additional cancer detected on MRI that was hidden from view on mammography.\n\nIn 73 of those 285 patients, or 25.6 percent, MRI identified at least one additional cancer in a different quadrant of the breast than the index cancer, or the cancer detected by mammography and/or breast palpation.\n\nThese multicentric cancers were larger than the known index cancer in 17 of the 73 patients, or 23.3 percent. In addition, the MRI-detected multicentric cancers were greater than 1 centimeter in size in 25 percent of the 73 patients.\n\n""We believe invasive cancer larger than 1 centimeter is clinically relevant disease,"" Dr. Iacconi said. ""In general, it is accepted that radiation can likely treat invasive cancer less than 1 centimeter, but lesions larger than 1 centimeter, especially invasive carcinomas, may not be reliably treated with conservation.""\n\nThe additional MRI-detected multicentric cancers were found mostly in patients with heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts. However, MRI also detected additional disease in 19 percent of patients with fatty or scattered fibroglandular tissue.\n\n""The results show that multicentric cancer detected on breast MRI after mammography appears to represent a larger tumor burden in approximately a quarter of patients and can result in potential changes to cancer grade and treatment,"" Dr. Iacconi said.\n\n###\n\n""Multicentric Cancer Detected at Breast MR Imaging and Not at Mammography: Important or Not?""

""It was really nice to have the baby right there beneath my eyes where I could feel him, touch him, kiss him.""\n\nThat was different than the birth of her son Elias two years ago; he was whisked away to a bassinet to be examined. And unlike Elias, who cried a lot after delivery, Shabaik says Ali stopped crying ""within seconds"" after being placed on her chest.\n\nKangaroo mother care has been widely used worldwide to care for premature babies, and it\'s gaining popularity in caring for healthy full term babies like Ali as well. It is as it sounds: Like a kangaroo\'s pouch, mothers hold their naked newborns on their bare chest for the first few hours of life.\n\nAt Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where Ali was born, the technique is routinely practiced for healthy mothers and newborns. The baby gets to know their mother immediately, says Dr. Larry Gray, behavioral and developmental pediatrician at Comer Children\'s Hospital, University of Chicago Medicine. ""The baby gets landed in a trusting environment,"" he says, reassuring them that life outside the womb can also be ""soft, comfortable and warm.""\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Morgan Walker for NPR Morgan Walker for NPR\n\nThe benefits are many, according to Dr. Lydia Kyung-Min Lee, an ob-gyn at UCLA. Not only is the baby happier, she says, but his or her vitals are more stable. Body temperature, heart and breathing rate normalize more quickly. The close contact also allows the baby to be exposed to the same bacteria as the mother, which can protect against allergies and infection in the future. Infants who receive kangaroo care breast feed more easily, Lee says, and their mothers tend to breast feed for longer periods of time, which is ""all good.""\n\nBabies also seem to suffer less pain. Almost 20 years ago, Gray studied how babies respond to a heel prick to draw blood, a procedure that screens newborns for genetic disorders. He found that when healthy newborns had kangaroo care, there was less facial grimacing and crying suggesting pain, compared to babies who had been swaddled and had the procedure in their bassinets, ""sort of alone.""\n\nOne of the first places to show how this technique can help preemies was Colombia in the 1990s. There, hospitals with no access to incubators and other equipment often sent home preemies with no expectation that they would live. But doctors were surprised to see that babies whose mothers carried them close, skin to skin, not only survived but thrived.\n\nThis was a ""serendipitous magical finding,"" says Gray, suggesting that skin-to-skin contact acted something like a ""natural incubator.""\n\nGray also points to the work of Myron Hofer, a psychiatrist with Columbia University Medical Center who studies attachment between mother and infants. Hofer coined the term ""hidden regulators"" that pass between mother and baby. It\'s not just that mother and baby are together, Gray says, but also that the mother is in some way ""programming the baby, the breathing, temperature and heart rate.""\n\nThat ""magic"" can also happen between baby and father, too, says Gray, if there\'s skin-to-skin contact. And if mothers or babies are very sick and have to be isolated, Gray suggests mothers take any opportunity to hold their infant skin to skin. Even a little bit of kangaroo contact, he says, can be beneficial.']",Even interventions as gentle as this–where the mother and baby essentially snuggle–deserve a discussion of the actual scope and size of the benefits.,"This story discusses kangaroo care for newborns–full term or premature–and suggests that babies benefit in a multitude of ways if they receive skin-to-skin contact with mom.
Unfortunately, the story is for the most part anecdotal, with a recent 20-year follow-up study referenced only briefly. There were lots of notable findings from this study, easily available in the news release. As well, an editorial related to the study covered key limitations to those findings.

The implants are currently approved for three years, and the hormonal IUD used in the study is approved for five. (There is also a non-hormonal IUD that is approved for 12 years, but it was not included in the current study.)\n\nAll the women were between the ages of 18 and 45 and their contraceptives were within six months of expiring before they enrolled in the study. The women were informed of the pregnancy risk associated with using their device longer than recommended, and the researchers called them for followup every 6 months for 36 months or until the women had their device removed.\n\nBy the end of the trial period, none of the women using the implant were pregnant and there was one pregnancy among the women using the IUD. Still, the failure rate was similar to the failure rate of the IUD when used during the five-year period (which is under 1%). The study is still ongoing, and the researchers plan to recruit up to 800 women and ultimately test whether the IUDs and implants were effective for up to three years after their current FDA-approved duration.\n\nThe benefit of being able to use the implant and IUD for a longer period of time is that it could reduce costs for individuals and insurance. The longer use also makes the IUD and implant more convenient for women, since maintenance is reduced.\n\nThough the data is preliminary, the researchers say they believe that the hormonal IUD and the implant can both be used for an additional year longer than the FDA recommends.

These efficacy analyses evaluated patient subgroups based on the number of ε4 alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor in up to 65 percent of patients with AD. 1,2 The published results showed a gene-dose effect at the high dose of tramiprosate (150 mg, twice daily), with patients with two APOE4 alleles (APOE4/4 homozygotes) showing the largest clinical benefit, those with one APOE4 allele (APOE4 heterozygotes) showing an intermediate benefit, while APOE4 non-carriers showed no benefit from tramiprosate. The results published in JPAD are the first evidence from a large clinical trial to associate efficacy of an amyloid-targeted agent with APOE4 status in AD patients.\n\nThe manuscript, titled ""Clinical Benefits of Tramiprosate in Alzheimer\'s Disease Are Associated with Higher Number of APOE4 Alleles: The \'APOE4 Gene-Dose Effect\',"" is featured in the advanced online publication of The Journal of the Prevention of Alzheimer\'s Disease (JPAD) 3 with lead authors from Alzheon, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on treatments for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on the analyses in the publication, Alzheon is developing ALZ-801, an optimized oral prodrug of tramiprosate, and has refined the design of the pivotal clinical trial to evaluate ALZ-801 as a potential disease-modifying agent in symptomatic AD patients who are APOE4/4 homozygotes.\n\nAnton P. Porsteinsson, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and Director of the Alzheimer\'s Disease Care, Research and Education Program at the University of Rochester in Rochester, NY, and an investigator in the North American Phase 3 clinical trial, commented: ""The genetically-defined population of APOE4 carriers has an 8-12 fold increased risk of developing AD and has more rapidly progressive disease, usually becoming symptomatic a decade earlier than non-carriers of the APOE4 genotype. These analyses with tramiprosate in the APOE4 subgroups are compelling, and suggest a meaningful clinical benefit, on top of the existing symptomatic AD treatments, in Alzheimer\'s patients who are in great need of new treatments. We can apply these insights about the therapeutic response of APOE4 carriers to refine patient selection and potentially improve the success rate of new Alzheimer\'s medicines.""\n\nThe efficacy and safety analyses with tramiprosate published in JPAD reveal a therapeutic effect in patients who are carriers of APOE4 after segmenting them from the larger, non-genetically-defined study population in the Phase 3 clinical program, involving more than 2,000 AD patients in North America and Europe. In the overall Mild and Moderate AD study population with baseline MMSE of 16-26 (and any APOE genotype), the North American study did not demonstrate a significant benefit with either of two tramiprosate doses (100 mg BID and 150 mg BID), compared to placebo, during the 78-week study period. 4 As a result, the European study was terminated before completion, and the results were not previously published.\n\n""To our knowledge, this is the first time that the clinical benefits of an amyloid-targeted agent have been associated with the number of APOE4 alleles in Alzheimer\'s patients. This new insight shows how we can apply a precision medicine approach in AD and develop this drug for the right patients, namely patients with the APOE4 genotype, which carries the highest risk as well as the earliest onset and faster disease progression,"" said Martin Tolar, MD, PhD, Founder, President and CEO of Alzheon. ""These newly-published findings form the basis for the design of our Phase 3 program, and further support our company\'s commitment to advance ALZ-801 into pivotal studies in APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients who represent up to 15% of AD patients1. We are preparing to advance ALZ-801, a promising new treatment for Alzheimer\'s disease, into confirmatory clinical studies in 2017.""\n\nThe observed gene-dose effects of tramiprosate in APOE4 carriers are consistent with the prevalence of amyloid pathology in AD patients. Amyloid imaging in AD clinical trials has shown the highest prevalence of positive amyloid scans in APOE4/4 homozygotes, and the lowest prevalence in APOE4 non-carriers. 5 As one of the few orally-administered amyloid-targeted agents, tramiprosate blocks the aggregation of beta amyloid monomers into toxic oligomers, and was developed to show efficacy in patients with amyloid pathology and an accurate diagnosis of AD.\n\nEfficacy Results in APOE4/4 Homozygous Patients from the JPAD Phase 3 Analyses\n\nThe published results showed the largest clinical benefit in the Alzheimer\'s APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients, who represent approximately 15 percent of patients in the study.3 APOE4/4 homozygous patients who received the high dose of tramiprosate showed efficacy benefit compared to placebo on both cognitive and functional measures in the Phase 3 analyses. The effects on the ADAS-cog cognitive outcome were significant at Week 65 (LS means difference from placebo: 3.47, nominal p = 0.007) and Week 78 (2.60, nominal p = 0.043), and corresponded to 66 percent and 40 percent benefit from tramiprosate compared to placebo. These effects were supported by functional benefits on the CDR-SB that showed a positive trend at Week 65 (LS means difference from placebo: 0.79, nominal p = 0.063) and were numerically in favor of tramiprosate at Week 78 (0.54, nominal p = 0.21).\n\n""APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients are especially challenging since they are known to have the highest burden of amyloid pathology in cerebral cortex and blood vessels, which explains their susceptibility to ARIA-E with some amyloid-targeted treatments. In these new subgroup analyses, the high dose of tramiprosate showed promising clinical effects in APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients already receiving maximal standard of care, and this dose was not associated with any events of vasogenic edema,"" said Susan Abushakra, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Alzheon and lead author on the JPAD publication. ""Replication of these findings in Alzheon\'s planned Phase 3 study would provide a meaningful therapeutic advance for AD patients with the APOE4/4 genotype, and we are now preparing to carry forward these results into the development of ALZ-801.""\n\nSafety Results from the JPAD Phase 3 Analyses\n\nThe safety profile of tramiprosate in 2,025 AD patients across the two studies was favorable and similar in the APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. The main adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting and weight loss), which were mild or moderate in severity.\n\nNew ARIA-E safety analyses were reported in the JPAD publication. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations in 426 patients were conducted during the Phase 3 studies and did not reveal any events of vasogenic brain edema (ARIA-E or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema) on either dose of tramiprosate. Vasogenic edema (or brain swelling) is a side effect observed in clinical studies with some injectable anti-amyloid antibodies, which requires MRI monitoring and can occasionally be serious. 6\n\nAbout Tramiprosate and the New Prodrug ALZ-801\n\nIn 2013, Alzheon obtained the license to tramiprosate and the associated portfolio of drug compounds, along with the historical clinical dataset, and applied new insights to the existing data. This led to the development of an optimized oral, amyloid-targeted drug candidate, ALZ-801. Alzheon developed ALZ-801 as a novel oral prodrug of tramiprosate, designed to improve the pharmacokinetic and gastrointestinal tolerability profile, while retaining tramiprosate as the active agent in ALZ-801. Phase 1 studies in more than 170 subjects, including healthy elderly, showed that ALZ-801 provides consistent plasma levels of tramiprosate, with very low inter-subject variability. The rate of nausea and vomiting was also lower than with tramiprosate tablets. ALZ-801 at the dose of 265 mg provided equivalent systemic plasma exposures to tramiprosate 150 mg tablets. Alzheon is advancing ALZ-801 into pivotal Phase 3 studies in the genetically-defined APOE4/4 homozygous patients with Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\nAbout Apolipoprotein E\n\nApolipoprotein E, or APOE, is a gene that provides a predictive window into an individual\'s Alzheimer\'s disease prognosis. APOE encodes for a protein called apolipoprotein E, which combines with fats to form lipoproteins that can be moved throughout the body. In the brain, apolipoprotein E helps shuttle cholesterol to neurons to support their normal function. There are three forms, or alleles, of the APOE gene, called ε2, ε3 and ε4. The ε4 allele has been found to correlate with high risk of developing Alzheimer\'s disease. People who inherit one copy of the ε4 allele, APOE4 heterozygotes, have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele, APOE4 homozygotes, are at even greater risk and tend to have more aggressive disease. The ε4 allele is significantly overrepresented in the Alzheimer\'s disease population compared to the general population: up to 65 percent of Alzheimer\'s patients carry one or two copies of the ε4 allele compared to about 25 percent of the general population.\n\n###\n\nAbout Alzheon\n\nAlzheon, Inc. is committed to developing innovative medicines by directly addressing the underlying pathology of devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Our lead Alzheimer\'s clinical candidate, ALZ-801, is a Phase 3-ready, first-in-class, small molecule oral inhibitor of amyloid aggregation and neurotoxicity - hallmarks of Alzheimer\'s disease. ALZ-801 is a novel prodrug that builds on the safety and efficacy profile of the active compound tramiprosate, which has been evaluated in clinical trials involving over 2,000 Alzheimer\'s patients. Our clinical expertise and technology platform is focused on developing drug candidates using a precision medicine approach based on individual genetic and biological information to advance therapies with the greatest impact for patients.']",This release on an experimental drug treatment for Alzheimer’s disease focused on a small sub-group analysis after a larger study of patients found the drug was no better than placebo.,"This news release from a public relations firm on behalf of drug manufacturer, Alzheon, describes an experimental compound tramiprosate that showed some impact on patients carrying the APOE4 gene which is present in many people who go on to develop Alzheimer’s disease. The drug is thought to target amyloid — protein fragments that aggregate abnormally in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. But the dense technical language of the release prevents most readers from understanding the scale of the improvement reported in patient thinking or behavior during this study.
The major drawback of the release is that it didn’t talk about limitations of the sub-group analysis. While exploratory, this sub-group analysis cannot lead one to draw any conclusions about whether the drug “worked,” given that the overall study was negative.
The release also did not help readers understand when the drug would be prescribed, in relation to diagnosis, if the drug is approved.

Harms also are not mentioned and benefits are framed in such a way that erroneously suggest the technology will help “diagnose many gut disorders … paving the way to solving previously undiagnosed conditions.”

Each method has pros and cons, but there is little clarity whether one might be more effective than the other. For the first time, researchers have shown that more patients live longer if treated with the combination of prostate removal plus radiation therapy. The research was published September 25th in the journal Cancer.\n\n""There\'s a lot of debate about whether to remove the whole prostate and follow up with radiation therapy. Or, as a second option, to spare the prostate and treat it using radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy,"" said senior author Grace Lu-Yao, PhD, Associate Director of Population Science at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center - Jefferson Health, one of only eight NCI-designated cancer centers nationwide with a prostate cancer program of excellence. ""Our study suggests that removing the prostate followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with greater overall survival in men with prostate cancer.""\n\nThe risks of prostate removal, or prostatectomy, are well known and include higher chance of developing incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There are some risks associated with radiation treatment and hormone therapy, but they are less common, and are typically thought to have a lower impact on quality of life. ""Prostatectomy is an unpopular treatment,"" said Lu-Yao. ""Our study showed that only six percent of men with high-risk cancer were treated with it."" It\'s not just the risk of side effects.For some men, especially those who are not fit enough for the surgery, prostatectomy is not an option. However, this may be an option for some patients to reconsider.""\n\nIn the largest population-based retrospective study to date, Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues examined the records of 13,856 men in the Medicare-SEER registry diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer -- cancer growth that had not yet metastasized to distant sites in the body. Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues looked at the patients who were treated either with prostatectomy plus adjuvant radiation as one group, and compared them to another group who were treated with radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy. They matched the comparison groups by age, race and co-morbidity to control for factors that may influence patient outcomes, and analyzed which group did better 10 to 15 years after their procedures.\n\nThey found that 10 years after treatment, 89 percent of the prostate removal plus radiation group was still alive. That compared with the 74 percent survival at ten years in the group that received only radiation plus hormone therapy, amounting to a 15 percent survival advantage in the group that was treated with prostate removal.\n\n""For high-risk prostate patients we started the use of aggressive radiation therapy after surgery 20 years ago,"" said Adam Dicker, Senior Vice President and Chair of the Department of Enterprise Radiation Oncology at Jefferson Health, who was not involved in the study. ""We recognized that it may have curative potential.""\n\n""However, the proportion of men undergoing prostatectomy plus radiation therapy decreased significantly over time and there were trade-offs for the survival advantages,"" said Dr. Lu-Yao. Men who received the combination of surgery and radiotherapy had higher rates of erectile dysfunction (28 percent vs 20 percent) and higher rates of urinary incontinence (49 percent vs 19 percent).\n\nAnother interesting finding from the research was that slightly more than half of men diagnosed with the disease did not receive combination therapies for their prostate cancer. ""Two modes of treatment are recommended by both United States and European guidelines for cancer treatment. It was surprising to see only 29 percent of patients received the recommended combination therapies, and as many as 20 percent are not getting any treatment six months after their diagnosis,"" said Dr. Lu-Yao. ""Our data can\'t tell us the reason for this deviation from guidelines and further studies are needed.""\n\n""One of the strengths of retrospective studies of patient data is that it reveals what happens in the real world, rather than the carefully controlled context of a clinical trial,"" said Dr. Lu-Yao. ""Our data is revealing the real-world practice as well as some of the advantages and disadvantages of those medical preferences.""\n\n""This important study demonstrates that many men with high-risk prostate cancer derive a survival advantage through a multi-modality approach to their disease. Several large clinical trials are nearing completion that should validate these retrospective findings of the benefits of primary radical prostatectomy followed by additional therapies such as adjuvant radiation,"" said Leonard Gomella, Chair of the Department of Urology at Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University), who was not involved in this research.\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded by the New Jersey Health Foundation, the National Cancer Institute (P30 CA-072720 and CA-116399 and the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey Biometrics Shared Resource.

The findings were published in the journal Cancer.
The study showed that a more aggressive treatment option, which involves radiation and surgery to remove the prostate, was linked with a higher survival rate than treatment that consisted of radiation and hormone-blocking therapy without surgery. The news release provided clear data on the scope of the survival differences in the two groups of patients. It also pointed out the serious harms of incontinence and erectile dysfunction associated with prostate surgery.
However, these strengths were offset by a significant omission: the release did not mention a major limitation of the study that prevents us from concluding that more aggressive treatment “may improve survival” as the headline suggests. It also did not address the costs of any of these procedures.

REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nA small-scale pilot study of psilocybin’s use in cases of treatment-resistant depression showed it was safe and effective, the British researchers said.\n\nOf 12 patients given the drug, all showed some decrease in symptoms of depression for at least three weeks. Seven continued to show a positive response at three months. Five remained in remission beyond the three months.\n\nRobin Carhart-Harris, who led the study at Imperial College London’s department of medicine, said the results, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, were striking.\n\nMany patients described a profound experience, he said, and appeared to undergo a shift in the way they perceived the world.\n\n“But we shouldn’t get carried away with these results,” he told reporters at a briefing in London. “This isn’t a magic bullet. We’re just learning how to do this treatment.”\n\nMagic mushrooms grow worldwide and have been used since ancient times, both for recreation and for religious rites.\n\nBritish researchers led by David Nutt, a professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial, have been exploring the potential of psilocybin to ease severe forms of depression in people who don’t respond to other treatments.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that some 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression, a common mental disorder characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, tiredness, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep and appetite, and poor concentration.\n\nMany patients respond to treatment with anti depressants and cognitive behavioral therapy, but around 20 percent don’t get better and are classed as having treatment-resistant depression.\n\nPsilocybin acts on the serotonin system, suggesting it could be developed for treating depression. But hallucinogenic drugs can also cause unpleasant reactions, including anxiety and paranoia, so Nutt’s team wanted to find out if psilocybin can be given safely.\n\nThe trial involved six men and six women, aged between 30 and 64, all diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They all went through a full screening process before being allowed to participate and they were fully supported before, during and after they received psilocybin.\n\nThe patients were given psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions, seven days apart.\n\nBlood pressure, heart rate and the self-reported intensity of the effects of psilocybin were monitored during each session, and the patients were seen by a psychiatrist the next day and one, two, three and five weeks after the second dose.\n\n""Pappardelle Magic Mushroom Truffles"" prepared by chef Harlan Goldstein is shown at Gold restaurant in Hong Kong March 6, 2012. REUTERS/Andy Ho\n\nCarhart-Harris said no serious side effects were reported during the study, although all volunteers said they were slightly anxious before and during initial drug administration.\n\n“Psychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place,” he said. “I wouldn’t want members of the public thinking they can treat their own depressions by picking their own magic mushrooms. That kind of approach could be risky.”\n\nNutt said the results showed that psilocybin “is safe and fast acting, so may - if administered carefully - have value for these patients.”']",The study was meant to establish the safety of the chemical for future research–and not its potential to cure depression. The story didn’t make that clear.,"This is a story about a small study of the use of psilocybin—the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms”—among 12 people suffering from treatment-resistant depression.
Given that this was a “proof of principle” study–designed only to explore whether the intervention is safe–the real story here is not that the chemical seems to have made people feel better, but that its use produced no significant safety concerns in those 12 participants. Determining how effective a drug is must await controlled clinical trials, so a decision about whether psilocybin “works” is years away.
The story does contain cautionary comments by the researchers about the early nature of this effort, but headlines and starting paragraphs like the ones employed here seem to have already made the jump to possible treatment for severe depression. That, in turn, could send scores of desperate folks to their doctors’ offices, in vain. Journalists are probably not the only ones to jump the gun here.  It appears that this small study generated not only a news release but also a press briefing in London, a staging effort that seems disproportionate to the modest nature of the study itself.

The story doesn’t give data on costs, harms, and availability that might have injected balance into the piece. We’ve reviewed other stories that unfairly wow readers up front only to save caveats for the end, including a recent BuzzFeed piece on an experimental device that restored some function to a paralysis patient.

Studies have shown that stopping or reducing that enzyme’s activity dramatically reduces production of beta-amyloid peptides, which are toxic to the brain and lead to the symptoms -- including memory loss -- associated with Alzheimer\'s.\n\nBy using BACE1 inhibitors to gradually lower the enzyme\'s levels, researchers saw reduced neuron loss and better brain function in the mice, offering hope for human subjects down the line, according to the study.\n\nCleveland Clinic Lerner Research via Journal of Experimental Medicine\n\nHowever, researchers urge caution with the results as many Alzheimer’s discoveries seem to hold true in mice, then fail in people.\n\nCleveland Clinic researcher Riqiang Yan, Ph.D., an author on the study, told ABC News that in the mouse model, the gene that produces the enzyme was deleted, completely stopping the enzyme\'s production.

The enthusiasm is tempered later in the story, when it is noted that previous advances in treating Alzheimer’s in mice have not translated into success in treating Alzheimer’s in people.
The story tells readers there are BACE1 inhibitors in clinical trials in humans, and quotes the study’s lead researcher as saying these drugs could provide hope for Alzheimer’s patients, “if” they can be used long term and don’t have side effects. But that’s a very big “if.” Missing from the story is this background: a number of BACE1 inhibitors have been studied in human clinical trials and were not found to be effective. In fact, just before this story was published, Merck announced it was halting a BACE1 trial after an interim analysis showed it was unlikely that a positive benefit/risk ratio could be established.
The story also glosses over potential harms.

Pillsbury, MD, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery at the UNC School of Medicine.\n\nSYNCHRONY EAS (Electric Acoustic Stimulation) Hearing Implant System, which is manufactured by Durham-based MED-EL Corporation, received FDA approval on September 16.\n\nUNC participated in the EAS System clinical trials and implanted the device in more patients than any other hearing center that participated.\n\n“Our clinical trial participants were overwhelmingly receptive to this new technology,” Pillsbury said. “The technology is remarkable and so were the results.”\n\nThe implant relies on two auditory technologies – the SYNCHRONY cochlear implant that stimulates the auditory nerve for high-frequency hearing loss and the EAS audio processor, which has a built-in acoustic amplification for low-frequency hearing loss.\n\nThe SYNCHRONY EAS implant best assists people whose hearing loss is referred to as “ski-slope” hearing loss, based on the steeply sloping image that appears on an audiogram when a patient has more trouble hearing higher-frequency sounds. Using traditional hearing aids, those patients often have difficulty understanding speech above the din of background noise.\n\nNinety-seven percent of patients participating in the MED-EL EAS clinical trial reported a benefit from EAS within the first year. Ninety-two percent of participants reported an improvement in their ability to hear even among background noise, one of the most challenging listening environments for people with hearing loss. And 90 percent reported satisfaction with the device overall.\n\n“On average, patients performed more than twice as well on tests of speech understanding with EAS than they did with their hearing aids preoperatively, which speaks to the benefits of this technology,” Pillsbury said.\n\nThe National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders estimates that 26 million Americans between the ages of 20 and 69 have high-frequency hearing loss. While 2 percent of adults aged 45 to 54 have disabling hearing loss, the rate increases to 8.5 percent for adults aged 55 to 64. Nearly 25 percent of those ages 65 to 74 and 50 percent of those who are 75 and older have disabling hearing loss.\n\nThe EAS System FDA approval is for candidates who are 18 years old and older who have normal to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the low frequencies, sloping to a severe-to-profound hearing loss in the high frequencies.\n\nMED-EL expects that the SYNCHRONY EAS Hearing Implant System will be available in the coming months.']","With no details on the study design, and absent of measurable benefits, costs and harms, this news release reads more like an ad.","Synchrony EAS (electric acoustic stimulation) hearing implant. Image credit: Med-El USA, the device manufacturer
This news release from the University of North Carolina purports to advise journalists and the public about clinical research from the university that helped gain recent FDA approval for an implantable hearing device designed for adults with a form of moderate to severe hearing loss. But this news release is a not-very-thinly veiled infomercial for the device’s maker, and a promotional piece for and by the head of the university department whose faculty members clearly stand to benefit from marketing it. The release is full of hyperbolic praise for the device (“The technology is remarkable and so were the results…”) and the university’s role in the clinical trials. But it is very light on quantitative data and information about costs, complications and side effects that would help readers judge the pros and cons of an invasive cochlear implant.
The release offers no links or references to published, peer-reviewed data; to the manufacturer’s website; or notes on potential conflicts of interest. There is some useful information about the prevalence of hearing loss in the U.S. and about what is novel about the implant. But this releases reads more like a commercial brochure than an informative and educational summary for public awareness.

The story contains some original reporting but misleads readers when it takes its lead from the news release and asserts that the observational findings “suggest that the right balance during recovering from concussion may be resting one’s brain but still getting some physical activity.” In reality, the main conclusion of the study was simply that the app can be a useful tool for tracking activity following a concussion.
This misleading notion is reinforced by the headline, “How to heal head injuries? Try a new app.” It’s not available for trying, and it’s not intended to heal head injuries. A more accurate headline would be “Researchers determine app may be reliable way to track activity and symptoms after a concussion, pending further research.”

REUTERS/L’Oreal/Laboratoires innéov\n\nLook no further than the beauty industry. It does lots of testing and flaunts products with scientific terms like microbeads, enzymes and rejuvenating serums. But what are the data behind them? And what if the company selling the product did the tests?\n\nTake Inneov Sun Sensitivity, a nutritional supplement “clinically proven” to protect your skin from the sun’s harmful UV rays while leaving you with a nice tan, according to its maker Laboratoires Inneov, a joint venture between L’Oreal and Nestle.\n\nThe pill combines lycopene and beta-carotene — the red and orange substances in tomatoes and carrots, respectively — with a probiotic reported to impact the skin’s response to UV light.\n\n“The efficacy of our nutritional supplement was demonstrated by rigorous studies,” said Nathalie Piccardi, of Laboratoires Inneov, who worked on the study.\n\n“The next step is to present this product to dermatologists,” she told Reuters Health, noting it has already been launched in Europe and South America.\n\nBut a closer look reveals some shaky science, said Dr. Peter Schalock, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who isn’t affiliated with Laboratoires Inneov.\n\n“Scientifically there are no data there,” he said about one of the company’s experiments. “It sounds like opinion and nothing more.”\n\nNO DIRECT COMPARISONS\n\nThe only published data on the tanning pill’s ability to reduce sunburns came out last month in the British Journal of Dermatology. To test the pill, scientists had dozens of women expose their behinds or backs to strong UV light. They found an effect on immune cells in the skin, but the question was, would the women also get fewer sunburns and better tans?\n\nTo answer that, Laboratoires Inneov conducted a so-called randomized controlled trial — the most powerful kind of study in the scientific toolbox — in which women were randomly assigned to take Inneov Sun Sensitivity or a placebo pill.\n\nBut the researchers never compared the response directly between the two groups, the whole point of a randomized controlled trial. Instead, they used a weaker method comparing the before-and-after differences within each group.\n\nWhile Piccardi said she thought this method was appropriate, it means the company can’t claim women taking their product had a higher threshold for sunburns than those taking a placebo pill. The same goes for the tan.\n\nAs a result, said Schalock, the company’s claim that women taking their product can sunbathe with less concern of getting burned might be a stretch.\n\nSchalock told Reuters Health he has a “hard time seeing that statistically or scientifically they have proven it.”\n\nCOMPANY FUNDED RESEARCH\n\nThe fact that the company did the testing itself could also raise a red flag.\n\n“There is some evidence to indicate that we are right to be concerned about the quality of research when there is a conflict of interest,” said Josephine Johnston, a bioethicist at the Hastings Center in Garrison, New York.\n\nJohnston, who said she could not speak to the scientific merits of the Inneov report, said other studies had shown industry-funded research is more likely to have positive outcomes, and that people could be influenced by financial interests even if they didn’t realize it.\n\n“The major problem,” she told Reuters Health, “is that it has an impact of trustworthiness.”\n\nBranding personal care products with clinical claims is a very common strategy, an expert who studies consumer marketing told Reuters Health.\n\n“Claiming that kind of a benefit is certainly something people respond to,” said the expert, a professor at an East Coast university who asked to remain anonymous because his institution receives funding from the cosmetics industry.\n\nWhile some people will want to see and feel an impact, he said, for many the clinical claim alone suffices. “The key question is, will the consumer view as credible that ingesting a pill will prevent (sun) damage?”\n\nWHAT DID SKIN DOCTORS FIND?\n\nIn another experiment, Laboratoires Inneov scientists gave the tanning pill to 80 women and asked them to sunbathe as they normally would over the summer, applying sunscreen at their discretion.\n\nThen they asked dermatologists, recruited by a company paid by Laboratoires Inneov, a series of questions about how these women fared. According to the report, the dermatologists told Laboratoires Inneov the product prevented sunburns.\n\n“We truly believed that this kind of study, taking into account consumers’ opinion, complements experimental and control studies,” said Piccardi.\n\nBut the study did not answer a number of questions: How did the women usually do in the summer? Did they end up like boiled lobsters or were they careful not to get burned? Might they have been extra cautious because they were part of a skin protection study?\n\n“It would have been nice to really know that it worked, and that it’s not just a placebo effect,” Schalock said.\n\nHe pointed out it was hard to draw any conclusions from this part of the study because it didn’t include any data. What kind of evaluations did the dermatologists do? What exactly did they tell Laboratoires Inneov?\n\nOf more than a dozen researchers and dermatologists contacted about the quality of this study, only Schalock agreed to comment.\n\nDr. Tobias W. Fischer, a dermatologist at the University Lubeck in Germany, offered this rationale for why he didn’t: “I don’t give interviews, criticizing other researchers’ work, even if industrial.”\n\nThe editor of the journal that published the study, Dr. Tanya Bleiker, said it had been reviewed by experts before acceptance, as are all the journal’s reports.\n\nWhile there had been some concerns about the methods, “on balance there was enough interest to publish it,” she told Reuters Health.\n\nNO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST?\n\nThe journal does ask researchers if they have financial ties to the products they are studying. According to Bleiker, “the authors stated very clearly that there was no conflict of interest.”\n\nHowever, more than half of the authors work for Laboratoires Inneov, as indicated on the cover page of the report.\n\n“It wasn’t being hidden that they worked for the company,” Johnston told Reuters Health. “The journal knew it.”\n\n“The question for the journal, given that the authors worked for the company, is, ‘Do we publish something like that?’”\n\nJohnston said there was an ongoing debate about whether or not scientists who review studies should know about potential industry interests.\n\nThe question then becomes what, if anything, to do when there is a conflict of interest.\n\n“The reader can’t do anything,” said Johnston. “It needs to be done by people higher up in the food chain.”\n\nWhether or not Inneov Sun Sensitivity has been “clinically proven” to protect against sunburns, “We have to deal with the fact that the scientific literature contains research from people with financial conflicts,” Johnston said.\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/vaj98m British Journal of Dermatology, online June 9, 2010.']","This was a fine piece of journalism, a troubling ","A five-star review for this ""buyer beware"" on an allegedly ""clinically proven"" product.

Now, eight family members have joined the study, and Dr. Biesecker is searching for more.\n\nEven so, finding the tiny, troublemaking genetic glitches in the family’s genes is an intimidating task. There are 30,000 genes in each person’s DNA, and each gene is can be made up of a string of hundreds of DNA letters and can harbor variations.\n\nMost of the variations are meaningless. In the entire DNA — which contains genes and regions that control genes — there are six billion DNA letters to check. To figure out what DNA changes might be important, the researchers are comparing the DNA sequences of Rick Del Sontro and his family with those of others in the study, looking for genetic changes that occur in every member of the Del Sontro family who has heart disease but that are not generally found in healthy people.\n\nDr. Biesecker acknowledged that there was no guarantee of success. He and his colleagues know the gene mutation in the Del Sontro family must be rare. Otherwise, lots of people would have early heart disease but no obvious risk factors. To keep the focus on truly rare mutations, the researchers are excluding those that are present in both members of the Del Sontro family and 3 percent or more of the other study participants. That strategy alone, Dr. Biesecker said, has eliminated the vast majority of candidate genes.\n\nThe researchers are now searching for culprits among genes that remain — a search that could take years. Or the change might be in a poorly understood region of DNA that controls genes rather than in a gene itself. Researchers’ ignorance of these control regions and what many of them do might doom the effort. So the researchers are hoping the Del Sontro family’s heart disease is caused by a mutated gene.\n\n“Our main job is to find the gene,” Dr. Biesecker said.\n\nStill, Mr. Del Sontro is preparing for the worst. He has life insurance and long-term care insurance.\n\n“I keep waiting for the day when I have shortness of breath,” he said.\n\nWhen his heart disease was first diagnosed four and a half years ago, Mr. Del Sontro, now 50, told his cardiologist he wanted to run one more Bay to Breakers race, a century-old 12-kilometer race in San Francisco. His doctor told him absolutely not, saying, “You are the kind of guy we will read about who dies during the race of a massive heart attack.” Mr. Del Sontro could still exercise, his cardiologist said, but no more than 45 minutes a day.']","This story focuses on a family that may have a rare genetic mutation that increases their risk of heart disease. Unfortunately, the “rare” part wasn’t mentioned until 1,600 words into this 2,100 word story.","This was an interesting and informative story about genetic research to uncover the causes of heart disease in people who don’t have the usual risk factors. The story engages readers by focusing on the extraordinary tale of one family that suffers from a high rate of premature heart disease. Though fascinating and frightening, this family’s harrowing experience holds limited value for the rest of us — and the story should have that clearer. Most cardiovascular events are effectively predicted by existing risk factors, and doing a better job of controlling these risk factors is the best way for must of us to prevent a heart attack or stroke.

Some scientists say this unnatural position can lead to pain, headaches and other symptoms, sometimes collectively called “text neck.”\n\nThe Claim: Technology itself comes to the rescue. An Android app called the Text Neck Indicator measures the angle of your phone and lets you know when you’re holding it in a favorable viewing position. And a new wearable device, Alex, monitors the angle of your neck and vibrates when your posture is poor.\n\nThe Verdict: Neither product has been tested in a human study. Some scientists say the technological nannies are a good idea. Others caution that neck pain and headaches have complex causes, and—to the surprise of some researchers—a recent study found that better posture doesn’t necessarily prevent pain.\n\nThe Text Neck Indicator, invented by Plantation, Fla., chiropractor Dean L. Fishman, shows a green light when your phone is tilted toward you at an “acceptable” viewing angle, defined by the app as at least 65 degrees from the horizontal, says Dr. Fishman. The goal is to encourage people to use their phones with their head in neutral position, with the ears over the shoulders, rather than craned forward, he says. Dr. Fishman has trademarked the term Text Neck.\n\nNamu’s Alex vibrates when the neck is tilted too far forward. Photo: Namu\n\nAlex, a small device worn behind the neck from Namu Inc. of Seoul, vibrates when the neck is tilted too far forward. Using an iPhone or Android app, the user calibrates the device by touching the screen when in good posture and poor posture. Alex was launched on Kickstarter and sells on Indiegogo for $99.\n\nIf you already have pain, “there may be a benefit if you use something like this in conjunction with an exercise program that strengthens neck muscles and muscles stabilizing the head,” says Alan S. Hilibrand, professor of spinal surgery at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia and a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.\n\nIn 2014, a study in the journal Surgical Technology International used a computer model to calculate that the force to the cervical spine—the seven vertebrae in the neck region—increased from 10 or 12 pounds with the head in a neutral position to 27 pounds at a 15-degree forward tilt and 49 pounds at 45 degrees.\n\nThe extra force results in more load on discs, which can eventually degenerate and lead to chronic neck pain, says study co-author Kenneth K. Hansraj, a cervical surgeon in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Technological reminders, such as Alex and the Text Neck Indicator, can help “raise awareness” about good posture, adds Dr. Hansraj, who has no link to Dr. Fishman or Namu.\n\nThe Text Neck Indicator app. Photo: Dean Fishman\n\nSome scientists say that, for reasons not yet fully understood, poor posture doesn’t appear to be as linked to neck pain as common sense would suggest. A study of 1,108 adolescents published earlier in May in the journal of the American Physical Therapy Association found no link between posture, including neck tilted forward, and either pain or headaches.\n\n“Can you say to the whole population: If you improve your posture you reduce your risk of neck pain? We haven’t the evidence to say that,” says study co-author Leon M. Straker. a professor of physiotherapy at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. Still, devices such as Alex could be helpful for certain people who have noticed that their pain increases with prolonged periods in poor posture, he adds.\n\nIn testing Alex, I liked that I could adjust the neck tilt the device considered “bad,” which allowed me to set reasonable goals. I also liked that the device allowed me to choose how long it gave me before vibrating to warn of poor posture. I chose to have it vibrate after my neck had been craned forward for a minute.\n\nIn a brief test of the Text Neck Indicator, on a friend’s Android phone, I found that tilting the device until the light turned green improved my posture from my habitual neck crane to a smaller bend forward. To achieve a neutral position, I needed to not only tilt the phone as prompted by the app, but also move it high in front of my face.\n\nThat illustrates the trade-off between improving your neck angle and potentially causing your shoulders and arms to hurt, says Jack Dennerlein, director of the occupational biomechanics and ergonomics laboratory at Northeastern University in Boston. To reduce stress on muscles when raising the phone, hold your arms closer to your body, says Dr. Fishman, adding that holding the phone at a proper angle and height gets easier with improved strength and muscle memory.\n\nCraning your neck occasionally isn’t a bad thing, but it is best for the body to move and change positions often, says Eric K. Robertson, director of graduate physical therapy education for Kaiser Permanente in Northern California and a spokesman for the American Physical Therapy Association. When you’re working on a computer or using a device, try to take a break every 15 or 20 minutes and stretch or change position, he says.\n\n— Write to Laura Johannes at aches@wsj.com']",The story is very up front about an important thing: There is no evidence that either device actually works.,"The story describes two products — a smartphone app and a wearable device — designed to improve posture and, theoretically, reduce neck pain, headaches and other ailments.
The story is very up front about one thing: There is no evidence that either device actually works. However, the story spends a fair amount of time explaining why they may theoretically work. On the one hand, this raises the question of why one would write a story about products when there is no evidence they work.

To participate, U.S.-based media may call 855-698-2663; international media should dial 011-646-754-2524. The access code is 48330192. Phone lines open at 10:50 a.m., and all media should place speakers on mute unless posing a question. Reporters wishing to ask a question should email their name and outlet to david.march@nyumc.org during the briefing so they may be placed in a queue; the moderator will call on individual media members to ask a question in the order names and outlets were received.\n\nIn a small double-blind study, Johns Hopkins researchers report that a substantial majority of people suffering cancer-related anxiety or depression found considerable relief for up to six months from a single large dose of psilocybin -- the active compound in hallucinogenic ""magic mushrooms.""\n\nThe researchers cautioned that the drug was given in tightly controlled conditions in the presence of two clinically trained monitors and said they do not recommend use of the compound outside of such a research or patient care setting.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins team released its study results, involving 51 adult patients, concurrently with researchers from New York University Langone Medical Center, who conducted a similarly designed study on 29 participants. Both studies are published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology on Dec. 1.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins group reported that psilocybin decreased clinician- and patient-rated depressed mood, anxiety and death anxiety, and increased quality of life, life meaning and optimism. Six months after the final session of treatment, about 80 percent of participants continued to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety, with about 60 percent showing symptom remission into the normal range. Eighty-three percent reported increases in well-being or life satisfaction. Some 67 percent of participants reported the experience as one of the top five meaningful experiences in their lives, and about 70 percent reported the experience as one of the top five spiritually significant lifetime events.\n\n""The most interesting and remarkable finding is that a single dose of psilocybin, which lasts four to six hours, produced enduring decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms, and this may represent a fascinating new model for treating some psychiatric conditions,"" says Roland Griffiths, Ph.D., professor of behavioral biology in the Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and of Neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He notes that traditional psychotherapy offered to people with cancer, including behavioral therapy and antidepressants, can take weeks or even months, isn\'t always effective, and in the case of some drugs, such as benzodiazepines, may have addictive and other troubling side effects.\n\nGriffiths says his team\'s new study grew out of a decade of research at Johns Hopkins on the effects of psilocybin in healthy volunteers, which found that psilocybin can consistently produce positive changes in mood, behavior and spirituality when administered to carefully screened and prepared participants. The study was designed to see if psilocybin could produce similar results in psychologically distressed cancer patients.\n\n""A life-threatening cancer diagnosis can be psychologically challenging, with anxiety and depression as very common symptoms,"" says Griffiths. ""People with this kind of existential anxiety often feel hopeless and are worried about the meaning of life and what happens upon death.""\n\nFor the study, the investigators recruited 51 participants diagnosed with life-threatening cancers, most of which were recurrent or metastatic. They were chosen from a total of 566 individuals reached through flyers, web advertisements and physician referrals. Most participants had breast, upper digestive, GI, genitourinary or blood cancer, and each had been given a formal psychiatric diagnosis, including an anxiety or depressive disorder.\n\nHalf of the participants were female with an average age of 56. Ninety-two percent were white, 4 percent were African-American and 2 percent were Asian.\n\nEach participant had two treatment sessions scheduled five weeks apart, one with a very low psilocybin dose (1 or3 milligrams per 70 kilograms) taken in a capsule and meant to act as a ""control"" placebo because the dose was too low to produce effects. In the other session, participants received a capsule with what is considered a moderate or high dose (22 or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms).\n\nTo minimize expectancy effects, the participants and the staff members supervising the sessions were told that the participants would receive psilocybin on both sessions, but they did not know that all participants would receive one high and one low dose. Blood pressure and mood were monitored throughout the sessions. Two monitors aided participants during each session, encouraging them to lie down, wear an eye mask, listen to music through headphones and direct their attention on their inner experience. If anxiety or confusion arose, the monitors provided reassurance to the participants.\n\nIn addition to experiencing changes in visual perception, emotions and thinking, most participants reported experiences of psychological insight and often profound, deeply meaningful experiences of the interconnectedness of all people.\n\nThe researchers assessed each participant\'s mood, attitude about life, behaviors and spirituality with questionnaires and structured interviews before the first session, seven hours after taking the psilocybin, five weeks after each session and six months after the second session. Immediately after the sessions, participants completed questionnaires assessing changes in visual, auditory and body perceptions; feelings of transcendence; changes in mood; and more.\n\nStructured clinical interviews, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and patient questionnaires, like the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, assessed depression and anxiety. Other questionnaires assessed quality of life, death acceptance, meaningful existence, optimism and spirituality -- generally defined as a search for the meaning of life and a connection to something bigger than one\'s self. To measure the changes in attitudes, moods and behavior over time, the researchers administered a questionnaire that assessed negative or positive changes in attitudes about life, mood and behavior.\n\nWith regard to adverse effects, Griffiths says 15 percent of participants were nauseated or vomited, and one-third of participants experienced some psychological discomfort, such as anxiety or paranoia, after taking the higher dose. One-third of the participants had transient increases in blood pressure. A few participants reported headaches following the session.\n\n""Before beginning the study, it wasn\'t clear to me that this treatment would be helpful, since cancer patients may experience profound hopelessness in response to their diagnosis, which is often followed by multiple surgeries and prolonged chemotherapy,"" says Griffiths. ""I could imagine that cancer patients would receive psilocybin, look into the existential void and come out even more fearful. However, the positive changes in attitudes, moods and behavior that we documented in healthy volunteers were replicated in cancer patients.""\n\nUp to 40 percent of people with cancer suffer from a mood disorder, according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.\n\nAnticipating wide interest in the psilocybin research from scientists, clinicians and the public, the journal solicited 11 commentaries to be co-published with the study results written by luminaries in psychiatry, palliative care and drug regulation, including two past presidents of the American Psychiatric Association, a past president of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, the former deputy director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the former head of the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority. In general, the commentaries were supportive of the research and of using these drugs in a clinical setting as tools for psychiatry.\n\nAdditional authors included Matthew Johnson, Michael Carducci, Annie Umbricht, William Richards, Brian Richards, Mary Cosimano and Margaret Klinedinst, all of The Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe study was funded by grants from the Heffter Research Institute, the RiverStyx Foundation, William Linton, the Betsy Gordon Foundation, the McCormick family, the Fetzer Institute, George Goldsmith, Ekaterina Malievskaia and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01DA03889).']","This release is very thorough in addressing benefits, potential side effects and study design in a meaningful way.","This release focuses on a recent study that found a single application of the hallucinogen psilocybin is effective at providing meaningful relief to cancer patients suffering from severe depression or anxiety.

""This could be an important tool worldwide, and even here in the United States.""\n\nThe test, known as the ""Xpert MTB/RIF"" test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to rifampin (RIF), appears to be more than 97 percent accurate and is even able to diagnose drug-resistant TB, researchers said.\n\nA report on the researchers\' work was published in the Sept. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Further trials of the new test are planned, the researchers said.\n\nCurrent testing for tuberculosis (TB) involves looking at sputum (respiratory mucus) under a microscope. But Siegel said such testing, which has been in use for more than a century, isn\'t always accurate. It also can take weeks for results from a TB culture, and infections can be missed.\n\n""That [the existing test] is knives and bearskins compared to this"" new test, Siegel said. The one potential drawback to the new test would be the expense, he said, adding, ""The key question is what\'s it going to cost?""\n\nFor the study, a research team led by Dr. Catharina C. Boehme, of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics in Geneva, Switzerland, used the Xpert MTB/RIF test on 1,730 patients suspected of having drug-sensitive or multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. The patients were from Azerbaijan, India, Peru and South Africa.\n\nThe test diagnosed tuberculosis in 99.2 percent of the patients, the researchers found. It also detected TB in 72.5 percent of people with the disease who had not been diagnosed with the conventional microscopic exam.\n\n""The test that we developed finally makes it possible to detect TB in a single clinic visit,"" Dr. David Alland, chief of infectious diseases at the UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, said in a university news release.\n\n""The test also indicates rapidly whether difficult-to-treat, drug-resistant forms are present,"" he said.\n\nThe test was created by the California-based corporation Cepheid, which plans to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the test, which went on sale late last year in Europe.\n\nThe test costs about $63 in Europe, but the company has agreed to provide it for less than half that in poor countries, said John Bishop, Cepheid\'s chief executive officer, as quoted in a story by the Associated Press. The machine costs around $30,000, but would be priced under $20,000 in poor countries, he told the AP.\n\nTuberculosis is a chronic bacterial infection that\'s spread through the air and usually infects the lungs, although other organs of the body can be involved. Most people who are infected with tuberculosis bacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) don\'t have symptoms, but some will develop the disease, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\nSome 2 billion people -- one-third of the world\'s population -- are thought to be infected with tuberculosis bacteria. Though largely eliminated in developed countries, TB remains a leading killer of young adults worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that 8 million people develop active TB each year and nearly 2 million die.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about tuberculosis, visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.']","A better test for TB is, indeed, reason for excitement, but this story glossed over some of the limitations of the research and failed to describe the real world limitations of making an expensive test widely available in cash-strapped countries.","This was a one-sided and potentially misleading story about a rapid new diagnostic test for tuberculosis (TB). The study discussed in the article assessed how accurate the new test was, but it couldn’t tell us whether the test improves treatment or leads to better health outcomes for TB patients. So when the story speculates in the headline that the new test has the ""potential to greatly improve treatment"" of TB,  we think this gets things off to a shaky start. The story could have recovered by also telling us why the new test might not lead to better treatment of TB. Apart from an incomplete discussion of the cost of the new test, however, this issue was not explored. As a result of this and other shortcomings, this story tilts much too far toward optimism in an area where huge challenges remain to be addressed.

Liz Stegall's ovarian cancer was detected as part of the initial study, and now she is “ecstatic” to be cancer-free. Photo: Brett Coomer, Chronicle Photo: Brett Coomer, Chronicle Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Houston scientists say test may show ovarian cancer early 1 / 3 Back to Gallery\n\nHouston researchers have demonstrated a promising new way to detect ovarian cancer early, a long-sought tool in the battle against the disease known as “the silent killer” because it's usually not diagnosed until it's difficult to treat.\n\nUniversity of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center researchers Thursday reported the results of a study that showed a simple blood test, tracked over time and followed by an ultrasound if needed, accurately picks up the disease in early, more curable stages. There is no such screening tool currently in use.\n\n“This is an important step forward in the effort to develop an early detection system for this very lethal disease,” said Dr. Karen Lu, a professor in M.D. Anderson's department of gynecologic oncology and the study's principal investigator. “If the study's findings are confirmed in larger studies, I think this new strategy will be practice-changing.”\n\nThe method used in the nine-year study of 3,252 initially healthy postmenopausal women caught five ovarian cancers, three of them invasive. There were only a few false positives.\n\nLu said the study isn't large enough to justify recommending yet. But she added that an ongoing study in the United Kingdom involving 200,000 women should more definitively determine the test's value. That study is due to show results in 2015.\n\nOvarian cancer, though rare, is the fourth-leading cancer killer among U.S. women. In 2009, according to the American Cancer Society, it was diagnosed in 21,550 women and killed 14,600. More than 75 percent of women are diagnosed when the disease has already become advanced.\n\nBlood test for protein\n\nThe new strategy involves an existing blood test for a protein discovered in the 1980s by an M.D. Anderson researcher and long used for predicting ovarian cancer recurrence. The protein, known as CA-125, has not been good at identifying new early-stage ovarian cancer because it can become elevated for other reasons, leading to false positives.\n\nIn the last decade, hopeful of finding a better test, ovarian cancer researchers have invested much time in the investigation of other biomarkers and technologies. But none proved as accurate as CA-125 after a Harvard scientist developed a mathematical model combining trends in test results and a patient's age.\n\nFollow-up recommended\n\nOne expert said the study is an important step but definitely needs follow-up work.\n\n“It's a well-done study about which its authors are appropriately careful in their conclusions,” said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy medical director at the American Cancer Society. “But more research and refining needs to be done before it should be implemented. I can remember when doctors all rushed to adopt the Prostate Specific Antigen test, and we still don't know how to use it.”\n\nLu acknowledged there are comparisons to the PSA test, which has come under fire in recent years for being better at detecting prostate cancer than improving survival. But Lu said that if the UK study replicates her results, the ovarian cancer test would have the advantage of producing much fewer false positives and being able to spot aggressive cancers.\n\nStudy participants were grouped as low, medium or high risk based on how much their CA-125 levels changed over time. Low-risk women repeated the blood test in a year, medium-risk women were referred for an ultrasound, and high-risk women had exploratory surgery.\n\nOver the study's nine years, 85 women had ultrasounds and eight had surgery. Three of the eight turned out to have benign tumors.\n\nUltrasounds cost $300, and the blood test costs $150.\n\nA real life-saver\n\nAmong the study participants was Liz Stegall, who enrolled at the request of the family of Linda Nelson Taylor, a friend who died of ovarian cancer that wasn't diagnosed until it was advanced. Stegall had no family cancer history, but six years into the study last year, she was diagnosed with early stage disease after a blood test showed a spike in her CA-125 levels.\n\n“I would say I'm ecstatic,” said Stegall, 59, of Sugar Land, who finished treatment at the end of December and is cancer free. “This new test came too late to save Linda, but thanks to her and it, I should be alive for some time still. And if I can be saved, so can other people.”\n\nThe study results were unveiled Thursday in advance of a major cancer conference next month.\n\nMore than half of the women in the study came from Houston. Besides M.D. Anderson, the participating institutions were The Woman's Hospital of Texas, Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, Women and Infants Hospital in Providence, R.I., and John Stoddard Cancer Center in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\ntodd.ackerman@chron.com""]","This story reports on one of only 6 studies highlighted by the American Society of Clinical Oncology out of more than 4,000 abstracts posted online a month in advance of its annual meeting.  This story – while still employing some hyperbole such as “a real lifesaver” – at least had one important balancing cautious perspective.","Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) is a protein found on the surface of certain types of ovarian cancer cells. The CA-125 test is used to monitor and guide treatment for ovarian cancer but has not been shown to be an effective screening test for average-risk women. This is because the test can come back elevated for many reasons and the false positive rate is high. However, according to new, unpublished results to be presented at next month’s American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, monitoring change in CA-125 over time and incorporating other factors to identify higher-risk women for additional testing may identify ovarian cancers at a stage when they are treatable.
The full results have not yet been presented or published and a larger, ongoing study in the UK should provide more clarification as to whether this method should be used for widespread screening. Until then, caution should be used in interpreting these results.
This story meets all of the criteria in relatively few words. It provides an adequate description of the current study, quantifies the benefits and harms of the test and compares it to existing alternatives (of which there are none). It does not engage in disease mongering and quotes an independent expert who provides valuable insight.
The story does mention how much the blood test and ultrasound cost, but could have raised the question of whether this might be too expensive given that thousands of women must be tested in order to find one case of ovarian cancer.

But these “extended criteria” organs – those from older donors or from donors who have two or more risk factors - do not tolerate current “cold storage” methods for organ preservation well.\n\nThis can result in greater injury to the kidney, or in a “sleepy kidney” which functions poorly at the beginning, requiring dialysis until it recovers days or weeks later. This early delayed function also impacts its longer-term survival.\n\nIn Ontario, about 20 per cent of all transplanted kidneys are expanded criteria donor kidneys. This means donors are on average older than 60 years, or younger than 60 years and likely have hypertension, higher BMI (body mass index), diabetes, or died due to stroke.\n\nEx vivo organ perfusion is an innovative organ preservation technique that seeks to overcome the limitations of current “cold storage” method of preservation.\n\nDeveloped in the laboratory of UHN transplant surgeon Dr. Markus Selzner, with the help of UHN transplant surgeons Drs. David Grant and Anand Ghanekar, as well as Drs. Lisa Robinson and Darius Bagli from The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), it took four years to perfect the solution for the donor kidney and to modify the heart-lung machine for use in the warm perfusion technique.\n\nThis technology has advantages over the usual cold storage method in which a deceased donor kidney is cooled on ice to about four degrees Celsius, with no oxygen, slowing down its metabolism, and inhibiting the repair process.\n\nThe kidney cannot survive longer than 30 hours in cold preservation. The new warm preservation technique avoids the damage of cold storage and instead allows the donor organ to improve and repair itself, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients.\n\nUsing a heart-lung bypass machine, with customized tubing adapted to the kidney’s smaller blood vessels - and a specially blended preservation solution of blood, nutrients, minerals, amino acids, oxygen, glucose, antibiotics and drugs – surgeons, nurses and perfusionists at TG prepared a deceased donor kidney in a transplant operating room to be placed in a warm preservation solution before transplantation into a patient in late November, 2017.\n\nThe aim was to enhance kidney function, minimize injury and avoid a “sleepy kidney” from an extended criteria kidney. About 30-40 per cent of deceased donor kidneys do not work immediately, requiring longer hospitals stays for the patients and dialysis.\n\nZhao Xiao, 53, received the deceased donor kidney, which was placed on the device for 3.5 hours at body temperature.\n\n“I feel great,” says Xiao, through an interpreter. He was able to get up and walk two day after his transplant. Xiao says he was happy to volunteer to become the first patient to receive a kidney that was improved by the new technology.\n\n“This can make a difference to other patients, so I am glad to be the first one helping them with my experience.”\n\nAs soon as the donor kidney was reattached to the patient, it turned ruby-red and started to pour out urine, indicating that it was functioning well.\n\n“It is a champion!” says an elated Dr. Selzner, who has done about 500 kidney transplants in the past 14 years. “It behaved like a normal kidney, despite it being an extended criteria donor kidney.”\n\nHe points out blood tests within 48 hours showed that the kidney was removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood normally. Since the kidney did not “struggle” after transplant, there is a greater likelihood that its long-term outcome will be better, he adds.\n\n“This technique will change the landscape of organ donation by improving organ preservation, allowing us to better assess and regenerate the donor organ on the device before we transplant it into a patient. We will know how healthy that organ is before the transplant operation,” says Dr. Markus Selzner, co-investigator of the clinical trial.\n\nDr. Selzner, a clinician-scientist at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and Associate Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, previously modified the preservation solution and supervised the research on a successful warm perfusion technique for the deceased donor liver organ.\n\n“Working on this project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional career,” says Dr. Lisa Robinson, Division Head of Nephrology at SickKids. “It is exciting to see this work be transformed from an idea to experimental research, and now to directly impacting patients.”\n\n“Even with the shortage of donor organs, we have to decline some of our donor organs because of the damage they sustain in the retrieval process,” says Dr. David Grant, Surgical Director of the Multi-Organ Transplant Program, UHN. He is also co-investigator of the clinical trial and transplanted the donor kidney, which was on the modified heart-lung bypass machine, into the recipient.\n\n“This new technology can help us answer the critical question, ‘What’s the best way to improve function and recover and repair the kidney before transplantation to get the best results for our patients?’”\n\nDr. Grant, who is also Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, emphasized that high-impact research projects such as this require strong collaborative teams – including researchers, surgical residents, nurses, Canadian Blood Services, perfusionists, colleagues at SickKids - working together on experimental and clinical trials.\n\n“UHN is one of the few places in the world where you can have a good idea and then find the right people to make something like this happen.”\n\nOther collaborators on the research and clinical trial at UHN include: Drs. Joseph Kim and Anand Ghanekar, co-leads of the kidney transplant program at UHN and transplant nephrologist Dr. Istvan Mucsi.\n\nDr. Grant also praised the strong support and efforts of Trillium Gift of Life, which co-ordinates organ and tissue donation across Ontario, in helping to ensure that the transplant team could begin their clinical trials with this new technique.\n\nThe technique of warm organ perfusion outside the body was pioneered by the Toronto Lung Transplant Program at TG in 2008 by Drs. Shaf Keshavjee and Marcelo Cypel to better treat, repair and assess high-risk donor lungs outside the body. The lungs are placed in a protective dome in which a system continuously pumps a bloodless solution of oxygen, proteins and nutrients into the injured donor lungs, mimicking normal physiological conditions.\n\nThis makes it possible for the injured cells to begin repairing themselves, and sets the stage for more sophisticated repair techniques to be applied to donor lungs. Since 2012, there has been an unprecedented 63 per cent increase in lung transplants at TG as a result of this system.\n\nAt any point in time, there are about 1,500 patients waiting for a transplant in Ontario. About 1,000 people wait for a kidney transplant across the province, usually about four years. About five per cent of people on kidney waiting lists die every year.\n\nResearch for the ex vivo kidney perfusion project was supported by the Canadian National Transplant Research Program (CNTRP), a national research network designed to increase organ and tissue donation in Canada and enhance the survival and quality of life of Canadians who receive transplants.\n\nGenerous philanthropic support, made through Toronto General & Western Hospital Foundation, has played and continues to play an integral role in the development of ex vivo technology and its impact on patients’ lives.\n\nAbout Toronto General Hospital\n\nToronto General Hospital is a partner in University Health Network, along with Toronto Western, the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute and the Michener Institute of Education.

For now, doctors will still rely on the tools they\'ve long used to evaluate thinking skills to diagnose most cases.\n\nRegardless of what tests are used to make the diagnosis, the new definition will have a startling effect: Many more people will be considered to have Alzheimer\'s, because the biological signs can show up 15 to 20 years before symptoms do.\n\n""The numbers will increase dramatically,"" said Dr. Clifford R. Jack Jr., a Mayo Clinic brain imaging specialist. ""There are a lot more cognitively normal people who have the pathology in the brain who will now be counted as having Alzheimer\'s disease.""\n\nHe led a panel of experts, working with the Alzheimer\'s Association and the National Institute on Aging, that updated guidelines on the disease, published Tuesday in Alzheimer\'s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer\'s Association.\n\nABOUT ALZHEIMER\'S\n\nAbout 50 million people worldwide have dementia, and Alzheimer\'s is the most common form. In the U.S., about 5.7 million have Alzheimer\'s under its current definition, which is based on memory problems and other symptoms. About one-third of people over 70 who show no thinking problems actually have brain signs that suggest Alzheimer\'s, Jack said.\n\nThere is no cure — current medicines such as Aricept and Namenda just temporarily ease symptoms. Dozens of hoped-for treatments have failed, and doctors think one reason may be that the studies enrolled patients after too much brain damage had already occurred.\n\n""By the time that you have the diagnosis of the disease, it\'s very late,"" said Dr. Eliezer Masliah, neuroscience chief at the Institute on Aging.\n\n""What we\'ve realized is that you have to go earlier and earlier and earlier,"" just as doctors found with treating cancer, he said.\n\nAnother problem: as many as 30 percent of people enrolled in Alzheimer\'s studies based on symptoms didn\'t actually have the disease — they had other forms of dementia or even other medical conditions. That doesn\'t give an accurate picture of whether a potential treatment might help, and the new definition aims to improve patient selection by using brain scans and other tests.\n\nBETTER TESTS\n\nMany other diseases, such as diabetes, already are defined by measuring a biomarker, an objective indicator such as blood sugar. That wasn\'t possible for Alzheimer\'s disease until a few years ago, when brain scans and spinal fluid tests were developed to do this.\n\nThey measure certain forms of two proteins — amyloid and tau — that form plaques and tangles in the brain — and signs of nerve injury, degeneration and brain shrinkage.\n\nThe guidelines spell out use of these biomarkers over a spectrum of mental decline, starting with early brain changes, through mild impairment and Alzheimer\'s dementia.\n\nWHAT TO DO?\n\nPeople may be worried and want these tests for themselves or a family member now, but Jack advises: ""Don\'t bother. There\'s no proven treatment yet.""\n\nYou might find a doctor willing to order them, but spinal fluid tests are somewhat invasive, and brain scans can cost up to $6,000. Insurance usually does not pay because they\'re considered experimental outside of research. A large study is underway now to see whether Medicare should cover them and when.\n\nAnyone with symptoms or family history of dementia, or even healthy people concerned about the risk can consider enrolling in one of the many studies underway.\n\n""We need more people in this pre-symptomatic stage"" to see if treatments can help stave off decline, Masliah said.\n\n———\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP\n\n———\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\'s Department of Science Education.

They\'re on the rise in the United States and no one knows why.\n\nSome children are allergic to many foods, and it\'s impossible to know based on preventive testing whether someone will have a mild or severe reaction. And so far there\'s no cure.\n\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University and Duke University are working on a treatment that may one day allow kids with allergies to safely eat the foods that cause them life-threatening reactions. It\'s still in the early stages, but Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins, who has been on the forefront of food allergy research, estimates the treatment could be brought to the public within six to eight years.\n\n\n\nIn his new study, researchers explored a treatment for children with cow\'s milk allergies. The strategy is to desensitize the child by giving small amounts of the allergen (milk). Oral immunotherapy, swallowing small amounts of the allergen, has shown to be more effective than sublingual therapy, which involves putting even tinier quantities of milk under the person\'s tongue.\n\nWood and colleagues found promising results from this small experiment with 30 children ages 6 to 18. These kids were severely allergic to cow\'s milk. Wood presented the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology this weekend.\n\nThe results suggested that children who went through a year of sublingual therapy followed by one to two years of oral immunotherapy were less likely to have significant allergic reactions when undergoing the oral immunotherapy. Still, it did not eliminate all symptoms.\n\nThis is particularly important, because about 20% of the kids that Wood and colleagues work with have significant reactions during the treatment that make the therapy unfeasible, Wood said.\n\nSome participants have shown they can safely eat milk products up to a year after stopping the therapies, Wood said. But only one-third have longterm protection. Others need regular exposure to milk in order to maintain protection against allergic reactions.\n\n""With milk that’s not too hard,"" Wood says, because one could ""eat pizza a couple of times a week.""\n\nIt\'s not known yet whether children respond better to this kind of treatment than adults, since there have been so few participants in this research. The big barrier to broadening the scope of the research is funding, Wood said.\n\nThis is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy, Wood said.\n\nOther research has shown that immunotherapy techniques may similarly work for children with peanut allergies. But tree nuts may be harder to treat, Wood said, because tree-nut allergic individuals often have multiple kinds of nuts they can\'t eat.\n\nResearchers are separately looking at a drug called omalizumab (Xolair), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe asthma, to see if it could help people with food allergies, too.\n\nDo not try the immunotherapy technique at home; these experiments are conducted under medical supervision.']","This blog post, based on a talk at a scientific meeting, didn’t score very well on our criteria, but the flaws could be easily addressed.","Strong point:

This type of therapy increases levels of dopamine, a natural chemical in the body that sends signals to other nerve cells and can significantly decrease in cases of Parkinson\'s.\n\nThe medication also treats many of the symptoms associated with the disease such as tremors and poor muscle control.\n\n""We found that those on a certain class of antidepressant, called tricyclics, didn\'t need the levodopa therapy until much later compared to those who weren\'t on that type of antidepressant medication,"" Collier said.\n\nCollier then began testing rats with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline and found that it indeed was able to decrease the amount of abnormal protein that can build up in the brain. This protein, known as alpha-synuclein, can cause the brain\'s nerve cells to die when in a clustered state and is a hallmark sign of the disease.\n\nTo further back up his research, he enlisted the help of his colleague and co-author Lisa Lapidus, who in previous studies had already detected whether certain compounds could bind to alpha-synuclein and stop it from accumulating.\n\n""Proteins are constantly moving and changing shape,"" said Lapidus, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. ""By using a test tube model, we found that by adding nortriptyline to the alpha-synuclein proteins, they began to move and change shape much faster, preventing the proteins from clumping together. The idea that this clustering effect is controlled by how fast or slow a protein reconfigures itself is typically not a standard way of thinking in research on proteins, but our work has been able to show these changes.""\n\nUnderstanding how these proteins can clump together could point researchers in new directions and help them find other possible drugs that could potentially treat Parkinson\'s.\n\n""What we\'ve essentially shown is that an already FDA-approved drug that\'s been studied over 50 years and is relatively well tolerated could be a much simpler approach to treating the disease itself, not just the symptoms,"" Collier said.\n\nCollier is already looking for funding for the next phase of his research and hopes to lead a human clinical trial using the drug in the future.\n\n###\n\nThe National Institutes of Health, as well as the Michael J. Fox and St. Mary\'s Foundations, funded the study.\n\nMichigan State University has been working to advance the common good in uncommon ways for more than 150 years. One of the top research universities in the world, MSU focuses its vast resources on creating solutions to some of the world\'s most pressing challenges, while providing life-changing opportunities to a diverse and inclusive academic community through more than 200 programs of study in 17 degree-granting colleges.']",Stating that researchers have “proof” that an antidepressant can slow Parkinson’s progression is misleading when the drug hasn’t been tested in patients.,"Researchers at the University of Michigan observed by looking at medical records a correlation between patients taking anti-depressants known as tricyclics and what appeared to be a delay in the worsening of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. Using rats and then test tubes full of cells, they experimented to see if the drug nortriptyline would slow the creation of alpha-synuclein protein, a hallmark of Parkinson’s. They did not do experiments on people.
The release does not give us any metric for the “slowing” that they observed. We wish there had been some numbers putting the results in context to help us judge the importance of such a small early study, or perhaps that the University had waited to issue a release until more was known.

Ralph Sacco and Tatjana Rundek of the University of Miami in an accompanying editorial.\n\nThe ongoing study, which used previous stroke estimates for comparison, was based on data from 4,789 patients from TIAregistry.org, an international registry designed to follow cases for as long as five years.\n\nIt didn’t include a comparison group, which would offer the best evidence, but it “helps build the evidence base for the importance of getting in for early treatment,” said Dr. Donna Arnett, dean of public health at the University of Kentucky and past president of the American Heart Association.\n\nAny kind of mini-stroke “should lead you to be evaluated,” said Arnett, who was not involved in the study.\n\nResearch reported prior to 2004 had suggested that the stroke risk is 10 percent two days after mini-stroke symptoms appear and between 8 percent and 20 percent for the 30- to 90-day period after symptom onset.\n\nBut in the new study, Amarenco and his colleagues found stroke risks of 1.5 percent at two days, 2.1 percent at seven days and 3.7 percent at 90 days when mini-strokes were treated aggressively.\n\nOne year after symptoms, the stroke rate was 5.1 percent.\n\n“Although this was not a randomized trial and there was no comparison group to assess whether specialized units performed better than nonspecialized (stroke) units, these (newly-reported) risks are substantially lower than expected. Outcomes in this study were at least 50 percent lower than those reported in previous studies,” Sacco and Rundek write.\n\n“The rate was remarkably lower,” Arnett told Reuters Health. The study was also noteworthy because, over the long haul, patients did a particularly good job of taking the medications they were given.\n\nThe researchers also found that the one-year stroke risk doubled when multiple blood vessel clogs were seen with brain imaging, a large artery was narrowed by heart disease and the patient scored a 6 or 7 on a seven-point scale that assesses stroke risk factors.\n\nMore than two thirds of the patients in the study had a score of 4 or higher but the researchers caution that “limiting urgent assessment to patients with a score of 4 or more would miss approximately 20 percent of those with early recurrent strokes.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1MGDlo3 New England Journal of Medicine, online April 20, 2016.']","For a study as confusing as this one from the New England Journal of Medicine, this brief story does a good job of describing it, as well as some its limitations.","
The story reports on a study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which reported that patients who had transient ischemic attacks (TIAs or mini-strokes) subsequently had a “lower-than-expected” incidence of serious strokes if they were treated at a hospital with a specialized TIA unit.
The study itself had significant limitations: There were a variety of interventions used at a large number of TIA units in many countries, but no control group or randomization. The TIA units were cherry-picked based on high volume of patients. All of the patients in the study received the best possible care–meaning that there was no comparable group of patients who could serve as a control. That’s good for the patients, but makes it difficult to judge what role the overall care played in limiting stroke risk and producing the “lower-than-expected” outcomes. And that’s perhaps the biggest weakness of the study: Its broad conclusion about typical outcomes versus what the study saw at TIA units. This comparison was made by looking at decade-old numbers on how many TIA patients typically go on to have serious strokes, but those numbers are outdated, since many treatments have evolved since then. And this was just one part of the study–it also looked at things like long-term medication adherence in patients treated at a TIA unit.
For a study as complicated as this, this brief story does a good job of describing the basics of the study, as well as some its limitations.

Maugh II, Los Angeles Times\n\nDecember 7, 2010\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA daily dose of baby aspirin may reduce mortality from a range of common cancers by an average of 21%, with the reduction persisting for at least 20 years, British researchers reported Monday.\n\n\n\nDeadly cases of stomach, colorectal and esophageal cancers all declined among people who took low-dose aspirin for 10 to 20 years, according to a study published online in the journal Lancet. The chewable tablets also were linked to a reduced risk of death from adenocarcinoma and from lung cancer in nonsmokers.\n\n\n\nThe results were based on an analysis of more than 10,000 people who participated in seven clinical trials designed to test whether baby aspirin could reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\n\n\n""We already had strong evidence that low-dose aspirin could reduce deaths from colorectal cancer by as much as a third, but this provides important new evidence that long-term aspirin use can provide protection against a variety of other cancers,"" said epidemiologist Eric Jacobs of the American Cancer Society. However, he added, ""it would be premature at this point to recommend that people start using aspirin specifically to prevent cancer.""\n\n\n\nFor the millions of people who are currently taking low doses of aspirin to protect against cardiovascular disease, ""the findings suggest that they should have some additional benefit for cancer,"" said Dr. Lori Minasian, who is in charge of large cancer prevention trials at the National Cancer Institute.\n\n\n\nMost of the studies examined by the British researchers involved primarily men, but the team said that the fundamental mechanisms involved probably hold equally for women. However, they added, there were not enough women involved in the studies to determine if daily aspirin could affect mortality from breast, ovarian or endometrial cancer.\n\n\n\nA variety of studies in animals — and even in plants — show that salicylate, the active ingredient in aspirin, can suppress tumors. Observational data in the 1970s suggested that aspirin could suppress tumors in humans, but alternative explanations were offered and experts demanded randomized clinical trials.\n\n\n\nIn October, Dr. Peter M. Rothwell of the University of Oxford and his colleagues reported on an analysis of four clinical trials comparing a daily dose of 75 milligrams of aspirin to a placebo in the prevention of strokes. They found that those who received the aspirin reduced their risk of developing colon cancer by 24% and their risk of dying from the disease by 35%.\n\n\n\n(A dose of European baby aspirin is typically 75 mg; in the United States it is 81 mg. A typical full-strength aspirin tablet is 300 mg.)\n\n\n\nIn the new study, Rothwell and colleagues started with eight clinical trials involving 25,570 people. They found that during the period of the clinical trials, which typically lasted for about four years, the risk of death from cancer declined by about 21% among those who were in the aspirin group.\n\n\n\nDigging further, the researchers realized that nearly half of the subjects had been tracked for two decades — long after their trials had ended. The researchers ""spent several years looking through dusty archives"" to track their fates and quantify the long-term benefits of aspirin for cancer prevention, Rothwell said in a news conference.\n\n\n\nOver a 10-year period, baby aspirin was linked to a 32% reduction in the risk of lung cancers in nonsmokers and a 30% drop in the risk of death from adenocarcinoma, the study found. Longer-term, aspirin was associated with a 64% decrease in fatal cases of esophageal cancer, a 58% drop in fatal cases of stomach cancer and a 49% reduction in the risk of death from colorectal cancer, the study found.\n\n\n\nAspirin was not found to influence the risk of death from pancreatic, prostate, bladder, kidney, brain or blood cancers, according to the Lancet report. Taking larger doses of aspirin and smoking had no effect on the results; neither did gender.\n\n\n\nRothwell noted that most of the subjects stopped taking aspirin at the end of the study — or, alternatively, many in the control group began taking it — potentially confusing the results.\n\n\n\n""It\'s likely that if people had carried on taking aspirin,"" the benefit would have been greater, he said. ""The benefit increased quite steeply with the length of time people were on it.""\n\n\n\nResearchers are not quite sure how the aspirin works. In the test tube, when cells divide, there is a chance the DNA in the new cells will be faulty. Healthy cells will recognize those defects and either repair them or cause the defective cells to self-destruct, said Dr. Tom W. Meade of the University of London, a coauthor of the paper.\n\n\n\n""Both mechanisms are enhanced by aspirin,"" he said.\n\n\n\nThe biggest potential risk of aspirin is gastrointestinal bleeding. Rothwell noted that the normal risk of GI bleeding is about 1 in every 2,000 to 3,000 people a year, and aspirin increases that by about 60%.\n\n\n\n""So the increased risk of bleeding is about 1 in 1,000 per year, while the decreased risk of cancer is 2, 3 or 4 per 1,000 per year,"" he said.\n\n\n\nthomas.maugh@latimes.com']",This story gives readers enough information about the limitations of this latest study of aspirin and cancer in order to understand why leading experts recommend waiting for more evidence before putting too much faith in the common headache remedy.,"This story about the apparent cancer reducing effect of daily low-dose aspirin seen in an analysis of data from a collection of earlier heart disease trials provides a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the latest study and its methods than some of the other stories we reviewed. It also provides more specific information about harms that aspirin can cause and it includes several independent voices that add valuable perspective. As a result, readers will be more likely than those who saw some of the other coverage to understand the call for thoughtful consideration before initiating a daily aspirin regimen in hopes of reaping cancer reduction benefits.

The combination did lower cholesterol levels in the 12-week trial and, most importantly, did not cause the feared side effects on the heart and other organs that have plagued similar thyroid-based treatments.\n\n""There was no doubt that eprotirome would lower LDL cholesterol. Thyroid hormone is nature\'s own statin,"" said Dr. Paul W. Ladenson, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and lead author of a report on the trial, published in the March 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. ""But this is a demonstration of lipid-lowering effect without thyroid toxicity.""\n\nDr. Bo Angelin, a professor of clinical metabolic research at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, where the drug was developed, said that the trial demonstrated that careful targeting of the drug\'s effect within the body could obtain the benefits of thyroid hormone on blood cholesterol levels, without causing damaging side effects. The trial was funded in part by Karo Bio, a small commercial spinoff of the institute.\n\n""We knew that thyroid hormone could lower lipid [cholesterol] levels but would have side effects on the circulation and bones and cause diarrhea,"" Angelin said. ""Even if the lipid levels were OK, it would be overall negative for patients.""\n\nHowever, he added, ""if we can get the thyroid effect in the liver [where cholesterol is metabolized] but not in other organs, we would be OK.""\n\nFrequent monitoring showed no ill effects on the hearts and bones of those taking the drug, the report said.\n\nAnd though statins are widely used and most often successful, an alternative to them would be welcome, Ladenson said. Statins are not effective in up to a quarter of potential users because of unacceptable muscle pain or simple failure to lower cholesterol levels, he said.\n\n""The first importance of the trial is that it shows hepatic [liver] targeting of hormonal action,"" Ladenson said. ""The second exciting part is its impact on lipids other than LDL cholesterol.""\n\nThough statins lower LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, they have no effect on other blood fats, such as lipoprotein A, which is believed to be equally damaging, Ladenson said. He said that significant reductions of blood levels of those fats were seen in the trial.\n\nLarger and longer studies are needed to determine whether eprotirome will have the hoped-for effect on blood fat levels without side effects and will ultimately reduce the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases, both Ladenson and Angelin said, adding that such trials now are in the planning stages.\n\nAt best, results would not be available for ""at least two to three years,"" Angelin said.\n\nIf eprotirome does pass all the anticipated tests successfully, its use at first probably would be in combination with a statin, Angelin said. Use as a single drug treatment for elevated cholesterol levels could follow, first in selected patients, then more widely, he said.\n\nIt\'s best to move cautiously, agreed Dr. Robert M. Califf, vice chancellor for clinical research at Duke University.\n\n""The effects on LDL cholesterol and lipoproteins are pretty exciting,"" Califf said. ""But if there is one thing we\'ve learned about drugs in this arena, it\'s that we need large trials to see how they measure up in terms of risk and benefit.""\n\nThe trial\'s researchers were careful to list indications of possible harmful side effects, such as a reduction in levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol, Califf said. But he echoed the thought that a longer-term and larger test is needed to determine the incidence of some possible major side effects, such as impotence.\n\n""I\'m not sure I\'d want to sign up for that one before I had longer-term results,"" Califf said. ""Being impotent is no fun.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on cholesterol-lowering drugs.']",The headline sounds definitive.  The research is not.,"Headlines matter.  When a story begins under the banner, ""Alternative to Statin Shows Promise,"" it leads readers to immediately believe that an alternative exists.  This drug isn’t even on the market yet.  Does it hold promise?

""Almost every epidemiological study I can think of found a decreased cancer incidence in diabetics taking metformin. The reduction is real and ranges from 30 to 70 percent.""\n\nThe researchers thought metformin\'s possible cancer-lowering properties suggested the need for clinical trials to investigate whether the drug might help prevent tumors in smokers at high risk of developing cancer. Others believed that the finding might influence the choice of drugs in people with diabetes.\n\n""All other things being equal, many diabetics face a choice of oral agents, and early evidence that metformin may have an effect on the oncology side may increasingly play a role in decision-making,"" said Dr. Michael Pollack, professor of medicine and oncology at McGill University in Montreal. ""We can\'t ignore this, but we can\'t say we have FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval for metformin for cancer indications.""\n\nMetformin was developed from the French lilac plant, known in the Middle Ages to control excess urination, a symptom of uncontrolled diabetes. The drug was approved by the FDA in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe study by Dennis and colleagues looked at mice that had been genetically engineered to be susceptible to lung tumors.\n\nMice taking metformin in their drinking water had 34 percent fewer tumors than those not taking metformin. And when the drug was administered by injection, the improvement seen was 73 percent.\n\nDennis stated that a likely mechanism of action resides in the liver ""and specifically the hormones [including insulin] that are released."" Insulin may have a relationship with cancer.\n\n""It\'s most likely that metformin is working by reducing insulin and IGF1 [insulin-like growth factor] levels in the body,"" said Lewis Cantley, director of the Cancer Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and co-author of an accompanying perspective piece.\n\nIt\'s also possible, however, that metformin is working more directly on the tumor process, the researchers said.\n\nA second study, this one a randomized controlled trial involving a very small number of humans (23), found that patients with an early form of colorectal cancer who were treated with metformin did see a decrease in possible cancer-related growth, compared with participants not taking the drug.\n\n""These patients were not diabetic, so they didn\'t necessarily have high insulin levels to begin with but lower insulin levels,"" Cantley explained.\n\nThis adds credence to the idea that metformin\'s value is in its ability to lower overall insulin levels in the body, Cantley said.\n\nAt this point, no one knows if metformin is safe in non-diabetic populations but some clinical trials are starting to look at the issue, Lippman said.\n\nAnd, pointed out Dr. Lucas Wong, associate professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine and co-director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program at Scott & White in Temple, Texas, while the new research is ""interesting and thought-provoking, what\'s proven in humans is totally another level.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more on metformin.']",Much more complete job than its ,"It doesn’t take much to please us sometimes – but putting ""mice"" in the headline goes a long way most days.  If you’re going to report this stuff, you better be up front about the level of research.  And this story went on to include other caveats, including an ending quote that was an apt conclusion – ""interesting and thought provoking"" but ""what’s proven in humans is totally another level.""

On another night, the windows and door to the room were kept closed. In the meantime, Mishra and colleagues monitored carbon dioxide levels, temperature, background noise and humidity. The study participants were asked not to drink alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks, which could influence sleep. They each slept alone, and the bedroom layout with furniture arrangement was kept consistent.\n\nFor measuring sleep quality, participants wore an armband that measures skin temperature, heat flux, bed temperature and skin moisture levels. They also wore a sensor that tracked their movements at night, including indications of restlessness.\n\nClosed environments tended to have less background noise – but they also had significantly higher carbon dioxide levels, which indicated lower ventilation levels.\n\nOpen conditions were slightly cooler than closed, although humidity levels were similar across settings, according to the report in the journal Indoor Air.\n\nNotably, carbon dioxide levels were lower when windows or doors were open.\n\nOverall, skin temperature and the bed temperature were higher in closed conditions than open conditions. The number of awakenings and sleep efficiency improved as carbon dioxide levels decreased.\n\n“Opening an internal door can be a reasonably good alternative if you don’t want to open windows, either for noise concerns or security concerns,” Mishra said.\n\nA limitation of the study is that the motion sensor often slipped off the sleepers at night.\n\n“Sleep quality is affected by many factors, such as health and emotional states, bedding conditions and different environmental conditions, including noise levels and temperature,” said Dr. Nuno Canha of the University of Lisbon in Portugal. Canha, who wasn’t involved with this study, researches indoor air quality and sleep during different ventilation patterns. He is also part of LIFE Index-Air, a European research group that focuses on human exposure to pollutants.\n\nIn a recent study, Canha and colleagues found that closed doors and windows led to higher levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other substances such as formaldehyde.\n\n“Sleep is essential to our life in several areas: health, well-being and productivity,” Canha told Reuters Health by email. “The exposure we are under while asleep is continuous . . . and we should play it safe in order to breathe better air during sleep.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2BOsgOd Indoor Air, online November 21, 2017.']","While we welcome a discussion of sleep quality, this story about a small study provides very little context for readers on how much air quality really plays a role in sleep quality.","In this very small study of 17 healthy volunteers in the Netherlands, scientists measured their sleep as they either slept in a closed room or with doors and windows open. The story claims the volunteers “slept better” with windows and door open, but gave no numbers for the amount of improvement, and didn’t do enough to let readers know this study had a lot of limitations.

It\'s a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland\'s brain.\n\nThe scientists published details of their work online Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n""It\'s a really weird sensation,"" Copeland, now 30, says in a video made shortly after he first tried the system. ""Sometimes it feels, kind of, like electrical and sometimes it\'s more of a pressure."" But he also describes many of the sensations coming from his robotic hand as ""natural.""\n\nWhen Copeland touches an object with the robotic hand, he can tell which finger the sensation is coming from and whether an object feels hard or soft, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer and assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n""But we\'re really not at the point where we could, say, get him to feel the difference between silk and burlap,"" Gaunt says.\n\nThe success represents an advance that is ""absolutely critical in terms of making prosthetics useful,"" says Mike McLoughlin, an engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nMcLoughlin is part of a team at Hopkins that developed the Modular Prosthetic Limb that Copeland is using. The research at both Hopkins and in Pittsburgh is supported by the government\'s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\nFor several years now, people have been able to control robotic arms using thoughts alone. But they have relied entirely on vision to know whether the arm is going in the right direction or grasping an object with the proper amount of force.\n\nThat makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says.\n\nSensing Touch Watch a blindfolded Nathan Copeland accurately sense which finger\'s being touched.\n\n""Without sensory feedback, somebody would have to actually have to look at the prosthetic, look at the cup, start to close the hand, (and) visually see the cup is starting to deform,"" he says.\n\nRestoring Copeland\'s sense of touch was a painstaking process, but the Pittsburgh team knew it was possible.\n\n""His hand has been disconnected from his brain because of his spinal cord injury,"" Gaunt says. ""But the brain hasn\'t lost its ability to feel.""\n\nSo the team began looking for a way to send touch sensations directly to Copeland\'s brain. The first step was to monitor his brain activity using a technique called magnetoencephalography.\n\n""We were able to see the parts of his brain that became active when he was watching videos of a hand being touched,"" Gaunt says.\n\nNext, the researchers placed tiny electrodes in Copeland\'s brain that could stimulate the areas corresponding to each finger. Then they waited for the brain to heal, as it adjusted to the presence of the electrodes.\n\nIt was several weeks before the team was able to send the first tiny pulse of electricity to Copeland\'s brain. ""When it finally happened, he just very calmly said, \'Yep, I felt it on my index finger,\' "" Gaunt recalls. ""But in the background I was breathing a sigh of relief and other people were cheering.""\n\nOf course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. At the moment, they are still too expensive, too bulky and too finicky to be used outside a laboratory setting. And there\'s no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.\n\nStill, the ability to receive touch sensation from a robotic arm has the potential to help not only thousands of people who are paralyzed, but also people with a wide range of physical disabilities, McLoughlin says. For example, robots that provide sensory feedback could eventually help a disabled person cook a meal or clean up things at home.\n\n""We\'re on the verge of something here that\'s going to transform lives,"" he says.']",This is a story about a case study involving one man and an experimental device.

(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)
Researchers published results of an experiment that allowed a single paralyzed patient to “feel” in a limited way through a robotic arm, via the addition of electrodes implanted in his brain.
It is an fascinating technology, and one that many people will read about. But, this is a story about a case study involving one man and an experimental device. Such an anecdote needs lots of backstopping, since many patients may never benefit from the incremental experiment being reported. We’ve seen this sort of story before – as here from BuzzFeed.
What’s missing in this story is more detailed caveats on how preliminary this technology is, and how there are many, many unknowns with this kind of research.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\nKeenly awaited clinical trial results released on Sunday showed heart-attack survivors on one of three doses of canakinumab were 15 percent less likely to suffer another major cardiac event than those on a placebo.\n\nNovartis had said in June that the drug met its goal in the study but details were only unveiled at European Society of Cardiology meeting in Barcelona. One leading expert described the benefit as “modest”.\n\nPatients getting canakinumab also suffered significantly more deaths from infections than those on placebo - but, on the positive side, they appeared to be at lower risk of cancer.\n\nThere was no significant difference in the rate of deaths from all causes between the placebo group and those on canakinumab.\n\n“The modest absolute clinical benefit of canakinumab cannot justify its routine use in patients with previous myocardial infarction until we understand more about the efficacy and safety trade-offs and unless a price restructuring and formal cost-effectiveness evaluation supports it,” wrote Dr. Robert Harrington, chair of the Stanford University School of Medicine, in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nCanakinumab had stirred considerable scientific interest because it appears to finally deliver proof that fighting inflammation offers a promising new way to counter heart disease in patients who already get cholesterol-lowering treatment.\n\nSubsequently, some analysts boosted their revenue estimates for the Novartis medicine into the billions of dollars, while awaiting the data announced on Sunday.\n\nCanakinumab is already approved as Ilaris for rare autoimmune conditions.\n\nVas Narasimhan, Novartis’s head of global drug development, said the drugmaker plans to go to regulators in the fourth quarter to seek approval for canakinumab to treat heart-attack victims with high levels of inflammation.\n\nHe downplayed critics who said the benefit was small, saying that one large subgroup in the so-called Cantos trial had shown a 27 percent reduction in cardiovascular risk.\n\nNovartis also plans to underscore canakinumab’s potential cancer fighting properties with the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nSEPARATE TRIALS\n\nThat’s after an analysis of Cantos data found total cancer mortality among patients getting canakinumab was significantly lower than in those receiving the placebo.\n\nNarasimhan, who said the company now plans to start separate cancer trials for canakinumab, said the drug could be particularly suitable for smokers with risks of both lung cancer and heart problems.\n\nWith the oncology findings promising but only preliminary, the company is planning additional studies in lung cancer starting next year, he said.\n\nIlaris now costs about $200,000 per patient annually for treating rare immune conditions and brings in some $400 million in yearly sales for the Swiss company, though its price is likely to be slashed should it win approval in the heart setting.\n\nNovartis initially struggled with the sluggish launch of its last heart drug, the $4,500-per-year Entresto, so it is understandably concerned about the reception for canakinumab.\n\nWhile Narasimhan said it was too early to discuss pricing, he argued so-called PCSK9 cholesterol drugs that cost about $14,000 annually should not be relied on as a yardstick.\n\n“In view of the additional oncology findings, we don’t think you should just think about this as a cardiovascular drug,” Narasimhan said. “I don’t think you can necessarily just make comparisons to existing benchmarks, such as the PCSK9s.”\n\nEven so, Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst, said the “marginal” data are not compelling enough to dispel what for Novartis will remain a pricing conundrum, should canakinumab’s approval be expanded for heart patients.\n\n“If the company cuts the price of the product in its current orphan indications, then it instantly sacrifices sales which currently total about $400 million per year with the hope that future sales in a new CV setting will more than offset this,” Anderson said in a note.\n\n“Some have wondered whether a particularly high-risk subgroup could be identified where canakinumab’s current price can be justified,” he said. “We are not hopeful here.”']","In contrast to a TIME article on this study, and some others, the Reuters piece is appropriately skeptical.","In contrast to the TIME article on this study (which we reviewed), and some others, the Reuters piece is appropriately skeptical and far more business-oriented, paying substantial detail to costs, harms, and regulatory challenges and cautions.

But serious side effects were more common among the briakinumab users.\n\n""Very high levels of response"" were observed and maintained throughout the study period, said lead researcher Dr. Kristian Reich, a professor of dermatology at the University of Gottingen and a managing partner at Dermatologikum Hamburg, both in Germany.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Oct. 27 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the drug\'s manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories.\n\nPsoriasis affects about 5 million Americans, according to the U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). The disease causes patches of thick, red, inflamed skin that have silvery scales. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, including the skin, nails, genitals and inside the mouth, according to NIAMS.\n\nThe current study included 317 people with moderate to severe psoriasis. The study volunteers had had psoriasis for at least six months, and the condition affected at least 10 percent of their bodies.\n\nNearly half of the study participants were randomly selected to receive injections of briakinumab at a dose of 200 milligrams (mg) for the first and fourth week of the study, and 100 mg at week eight and every four weeks thereafter. The study lasted one year. The remaining volunteers were given between 5 mg and 25 mg of oral methotrexate weekly.\n\nAfter six months, nearly 82 percent of those in the briakinumab group had at least a 75 percent improvement in the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI), a commonly used measurement to assess the severity of psoriasis. Slightly less than 40 percent of those on methotrexate had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score, according to the study.\n\nAfter a year, about 66 percent of those taking briakinumab had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score compared to almost 24 percent for those on methotrexate, according to the study.\n\nBriakinumab works by dampening the immune system response that causes psoriasis, said Bruce Bebo, director of research and medical programs for the National Psoriasis Foundation, based in Portland, Ore.\n\nMore serious infections were seen in people taking briakinumab (2.6 percent) vs. those taking methotrexate (1.8 percent). There were also two cases of cancer in people taking briakinumab and none in the methotrexate group. However, the researchers said these differences weren\'t statistically significant.\n\n""Cancer risk is extremely hard to define, and this study was not powered to detect any difference in the risk of developing a malignancy,"" said Bebo.\n\nHe said that in an earlier trial of briakinumab, some unexplained major adverse cardiac events occurred. At the time, Abbott withdrew its application for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pending further research. In the current study, no serious cardiovascular events were reported.\n\nOf the increased infections and cancers, Reich said, ""Although these differences were not statistically significant, they lead to questions regarding a favorable risk-benefit profile of the drug.""\n\nResearch on briakinumab is continuing. An ongoing three-year trial involves 248 people from the current study.\n\nFor people living with psoriasis, Bebo said the message from this study is that ""dramatic progress has been made from where we were just five years ago.""\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about psoriasis treatments from the National Psoriasis Foundation.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Overall, this story employed more measured language than that used in the competing <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=4397"" target=""_blank"">WebMD story</a>, with its sensational quotes from conflicted parties. </span>","But neither story disclosed the conflicts of interest of the principal investigator.  It’s difficult sometimes for journalists to dig and find conflicts of interest in those making claims about health care interventions.

And neither story discussed the costs of biolgic drugs in the treatment of psoriasis. These drugs can cost $1,500-2,000/month. We think that any discussion about a new drug should include some comment about costs.

Johnson VA Medical Center\n\nN-acetylcysteine, when combined with group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), reduced symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cravings, and depression significantly more than CBT alone in veterans with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorder, a particularly difficult-to-treat population, according to the findings of a randomized controlled pilot trial conducted by researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center.\n\nThis trial is the first to use NAC as a pharmacotherapy for PTSD and a broad range of SUDs. The results were published online ahead of print on October 11, 2016 by the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.\n\nThe National Center for PTSD estimates that seven to eight percent of Americans will have PTSD at some point in their life. The numbers are even worse for veterans: it is estimated, for example, that 30 percent of Vietnam veterans will have experienced PTSD at some point in their life. Approximately 40 to 50 percent of veterans with PTSD also have a substance use disorder (SUD).\n\n""Addiction goes along with virtually every psychiatric disorder at a higher percentage than it does in the general population"" said Peter W. Kalivas, Ph.D. the senior author on the article and chair of the Department of Neuroscience at MUSC. ""People who are prone to psychiatric disorders are also prone to addiction.""\n\nCurrently, there are no well-explored pharmacological treatments for patients with co-occurring PTSD/SUD. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for treatment of PTSD, pharmacological treatments for co-occurring PTSD/SUD have yielded suboptimal results.\n\nGroundbreaking basic science research by Kalivas has shown that levels of glutamate transporters are decreased in SUDs and that administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine can help restore those levels and guard against relapse in animal models of SUD. Because evidence suggests that SUDs and PTSD share overlapping neurobiological pathways, Sudie E. Back, Ph.D., lead author on the article, hypothesized that NAC treatment with CBT would be a novel approach to treat co-occurring PTSD and SUD. Back is a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at MUSC and a staff psychologist at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center.\n\nIn the eight-week randomized controlled trial led by Back and Kalivas, 35 veterans with PTSD and SUD, all of whom were receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for their SUD, were randomized to either 2400 mg/day of NAC or placebo. The average age of the veterans was 49 years and many were veterans of the Vietnam War. To be included, veterans had to have abstained from substance use for at least seven days. Of the veterans enrolled in the trial, 83% completed it, a very high rate for this difficult-to-treat population.\n\nVeterans in the NAC-treated group showed a 46% reduction in PTSD symptoms, compared with a 25% reduction in the placebo group on the Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), which assesses trauma history and symptom severity. The threshold CAPS score for diagnosis of PTSD is 50.\n\n""As a group, the NAC-treated veterans were below diagnostic level for PTSD at the end of treatment,"" said Back. ""For PTSD, these are some of the best outcomes we have seen in the literature for a medication.""\n\nCraving and depression were also reduced in the NAC-treated group. The amount of craving was reduced by 81% and the frequency of craving by 71% in the NAC group, compared with 32% and 29% in the placebo group. ""Craving is a key component of substance use in relapse,"" said Back. ""If you have a medication that can really reduce craving, that will go a long way to helping people stay clean and sober."" Depression, gauged using the Beck Depression Inventory, was reduced 48% in the NAC group vs. 15% in the placebo group.\n\nVeterans in the study had low rates of substance use during the trial, and the study found little effect of medication on use, perhaps due to the fact that all participants were receiving SUD treatment and exhibiting low levels of use. This finding could also be due to the relatively limited number of participants or to the chronic nature of the participants\' PTSD. ""This is a tough patient population with SUD to work with."" said Kalivas. ""We have Vietnam vets that have had PTSD for 15 to 20 years. This is not an easy-to-turn-around population.""\n\nAlthough these early, promising findings show that NAC reduced PTSD symptoms, craving, and depression, NAC should not be used as a monotherapy or substitute for evidence-based behavioral treatment, but instead be seen as an adjunct therapy that enhances it.\n\n""We would not advocate using it instead of therapy,"" said Back. ""But this could be something to help prevent relapse when used alongside a behavioral treatment.""\n\nNAC is available over the counter and does not cause side effects at the doses used in the study, but it degrades quickly when stored, is contraindicated in patients with asthma, and can cause nausea at higher doses and so should always be obtained and administered under a physician\'s supervision.\n\nThe next steps in Back\'s research are to run a longer-term trial of NAC in veterans with PTSD and SUD and to use MRS magnetic spectroscopy to better explore the effect of NAC on glutamate levels in patients with PTSD and SUD.\n\n###\n\nAbout MUSC\n\nFounded in 1824 in Charleston, The Medical University of South Carolina is the oldest medical school in the South.

REUTERS/Jeff Zelevansky\n\n(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s approved Keytruda lung cancer treatment provided superior overall survival to chemotherapy in a late-stage study of patients with advanced disease whose tumors produce a protein called PD-L1 associated with increased risk of the disease.\n\nThe U.S. drugmaker on Monday said patients taking the approved 2 milligram dosage of Keytruda and those taking an experimental 10 milligram dose had longer overall survival compared with those taking docetaxel, a standard treatment for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer. Keytruda thereby met its main goal of the study.\n\nPatients whose tumors had especially high levels of PD-L1 also went longer without a progression of disease than those taking docetaxel, Merck said. Those whose tumors expressed PD-L1, but not at high levels, did not show such a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival.\n\nSafety of Keytruda was consistent with what had been seen in previous trials among lung cancer patients, Merck said in a release that included only summary “topline” information from the results.\n\nMore detailed data from the study will be provided soon, Merck said, adding that it will ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration later this year to add the new data to the drug’s package insert label.\n\nU.S. regulators in October approved Keytruda on an accelerated basis for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors produce PD-L1. The approval was contingent on the company providing more detailed data in the future on Keytruda’s safety and effectiveness.\n\nKeytruda and a similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient’s own immune system to recognize and therefore attack the cancer.\n\nWall Street analysts expect cancer immunotherapies to earn combined annual sales of over $20 billion by 2020.""]",This story based on a news release has plenty of broad generalities but little hard data to back them up.,"The story reports on new findings from a clinical trial of the drug Keytruda. Specifically, the story says that patients with late-stage lung cancer whose tumors produce a protein called PD-L1 had increased overall survival when taking Keytruda rather than docetaxel, which is is a widely-used drug for treating lung cancer. The story offers little information on how significant the health benefits associated with Keytruda are, what it costs or what its potential harms are. The story claims that more data on the trial findings will be available soon — and, given the paucity of information here, one wonders at the decision not to wait for that additional data.

And he didn\'t want to give it all up due to a ""spot of pain"" in his elbow. ""This wasn\'t a traumatic injury,"" explains Holzman. It came on gradually and escalated from annoying to excruciating over the course of a couple months.\n\nHis physical therapist quickly diagnosed it as tennis elbow. Turns out, lots of people who develop tennis elbow haven\'t played the game in years. And some have never even picked up a racket.\n\n""If you\'re having pain on the elbow on the outside of your elbow when you grip a coffee mug or pick something up with your hands — that is almost always tennis elbow,"" says Barton Bishop, a physical therapist at Sport & Spine Rehab in Rockville, Md.\n\nPain from repetitive overuse of the tendons and muscle that run from the wrist to the elbow can come from all sorts of activities. It usually happens when people grip things too hard or too long.\n\nVIDEO: Tennis Elbow Exercise Holzman\'s injured left elbow muscle strengthens as it lengthens and contracts in this eccentric wrist exercise.\n\nIn addition to tennis players, Bishop sees the injury in gardeners with their shovels and trowels; painters with brushes; and golfers with clubs. In Larry\'s case, it was a combination of all his hobbies: from squeezing the handlebars on his bike, to lifting weights and playing in a band.\n\n""Gripping guitars and base drums ... can really affect people\'s elbows,"" says Bishop.\n\nWhen Holzman came to Sport & Spine for help, Bishop put him through a series of traditional treatments including ultrasound, strengthening and stretching exercises, cross-friction massage, heat and ice.\n\nHe also added a series of eccentric wrist exercises using a rubber bar called the Thera-Band FlexBar — ideal for the injured muscle in tennis elbow. The exercises enable the muscle to lengthen and contract simultaneously. And the FlexBar makes it simple to do this kind of stretch.\n\n""He\'s actually getting his muscle to work,"" says Bishop. ""It\'s a perfect exercise.""\n\nBishop says the benefit of the FlexBar, which costs between $16 and $33, over traditional hand weights is that it helps people strengthen without recreating the symptoms. He says weights can overwork the muscle and sometimes leads to more pain.\n\nA study by researchers at the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma, Lenox Hill Hospital in New York demonstrated this benefit. They found that adding the eccentric wrist extension exercises using the FlexBar was effective at improving strength and decreasing pain in patients with tennis elbow. (Performance Health Brands, maker of Thera-Band, provided the FlexBars for the study but did not fund it.)\n\nNot all physical therapists are sold on the FlexBar.

Prebiotics reduce body fat in children who are overweight or obese by altering their gut microbiota, according to new research published in Gastroenterology, the official journal of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients (such as fiber) that act as fertilizers to help stimulate the growth of good bacteria already in the gut, different from probiotics, which introduce new bacteria into the system.\n\n""This is a well-designed trial that demonstrates how a prebiotic could potentially help combat one of the most prevalent and costly conditions afflicting children in the developed world -- overnutrition -- by targeting the gut microbiome,"" said Geoffrey A. Preidis, MD, PhD, a member of the AGA Center for Gut Microbiome Research and Education scientific advisory board. ""It is promising to see this evidence that alteration of the gut microbiota can be used to restore health. As a clinician, I hope that continued research into prebiotics will lead to a new strategy for the treatment of obesity.""\n\nMethod\n\nFor this study, researchers from the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 42 participants. Participants included children, 7 to 12 years old, who were classified as overweight or obese (>85th percentile of body mass index) but otherwise healthy. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given either the prebiotic fiber -- oligofructose-enriched inulin -- or a placebo, once daily for 16 weeks. The prebiotic was provided as a white powder, mixed in water.\n\n""Powdered fiber, mixed in a water bottle, taken once a day is all we asked the children to change, and we got, what we consider, some pretty exciting results -- it has been fantastic,"" added Raylene A. Reimer, PhD, RD, professor and researcher in the Faculty of Kinesiology at University of Calgary, who led the study.\n\nResults\n\nBased on four-month intervention data, the annual projected body weight increase in the prebiotic group would be 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds), within the expected healthy range, whereas the projected increase in the placebo group was 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds), almost triple the expected yearly weight increase. Thus, supplementation with the prebiotic improved outcomes in children who were overweight or obese. Importantly, the researchers show that the prebiotic induced specific gut bacterial shifts compared to placebo.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThis is the first randomized controlled study to assess comprehensive changes in gut microbial composition with prebiotic intervention in children who are overweight and obese. Excess weight in childhood tends to persist into adulthood and is an early risk factor for obesity-associated morbidity and mortality, highlighting the importance of early intervention.\n\nWhat\'s next?\n\nThe metabolic and microbial findings from this study provide a foundation for a larger clinical trial in the pediatric population. Prebiotics are inexpensive and non-invasive and therefore a plausible dietary treatment in the overweight and obese pediatric population.\n\n###\n\nResources\n\nWhat is Obesity?

It inappropriately claims that weight changes seen after four months will continue on the same trajectory for a full year, and only reports the weight differences that researchers predict will occur after a year — while omitting the actual results observed in the study after four months. That’s highly misleading.
Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients, including fiber. The prebiotics used in the study were oligofructose-enriched inulin. The intervention may have slowed the acquisition of body fat in some children, but the release doesn’t tell us how that benefit is related to alterations in gut microbes or why it would reduce future risk factors in adulthood.

In a small, early study, carefully selected patients with cancer that had not spread beyond the inner lining of the uterus were treated with IUDs that released the hormone progesterone. The treatment was found to be as effective as oral hormone therapy, which is the most widely used nonsurgical, fertility-sparing treatment for the cancer. “Our results show promise for the treatment of younger endometrial cancer patients with early disease who desire pregnancy in the future,” gynecologic oncologist Lucas Minig tells WebMD. “But patients must be screened very carefully to make sure their disease has not spread.”\n\nTreatment for Endometrial Cancer Close to 300,000 new cases of endometrial cancer are diagnosed worldwide annually, and roughly 75,000 women die of the disease. Surgical removal of the uterus and ovaries is a standard, and highly effective, treatment for early-stage disease. While most patients are diagnosed later in life, up to 5% of cases occur in women who are still in their 20s and 30s. Oral treatment with the synthetic progesterone is an accepted alternative to hysterectomy in carefully screened younger women with early endometrial cancer. The treatment slows tumor growth but is not well tolerated by some women.']","The story addresses most of our criteria –  but – as is often the case, no discussion of costs or potential harms. ","The standard treatment for endometrial cancer is hysterectomy, or surgical removal of the uterus.  However, some women, including younger women who wish to preserve their fertility, may prefer non-surgical alternatives. A study published in the Annals of Oncology suggests that younger women (under age 40) with pre-cancerous lesions (known as hyperplasia) or early-stage cancer, may be able to safely treat their condition with the progestin IUD (brand name Mirena). 
This story does a good job reporting on the new study and its implications. It gives the reader enough relevant information to evaluate the strength of the new study and the information that it may add to clinical practice. It provides important caveats for interpreting the results, such as the small size of the study and preliminary results. It quotes independent experts who provide context for the information.
The story could have been improved by mentioning the cost of the IUD and mentioning some potential harms of the treatment.

Lungs are clogged with a thick mucus, which can lead to lung infections. The disease also affects the pancreas, making it difficult for the body to absorb food, which significantly stunts growth and often leads to early deaths.\n\nThe researchers studied cases of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis going back to the 1990s who received an injection of human growth hormone every day for six months to a year.\n\nIn the 1950s, children with cystic fibrosis generally died before age 8. But with antibiotics and other medical advances, the median age for people with the disease increased to 37 by 2008.\n\n""As the kids with cystic fibrosis are living longer and longer, a lot of these ancillary problems are become more apparent,"" said C. Michael White, director of the Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author of the study.\n\nIn the cases studied, the researchers found that human growth hormone added 1.25 inches in height and three pounds to the patients. That growth also resulted in larger internal organs, particularly the lungs, making breathing easier.\n\nHGH also appears to improve the mineral content in bones, making them stronger. There\'s not enough evidence that it prevents osteoporosis, a common result of cystic fibrosis, but White said the results are ""promising.""\n\nFor those who received human growth hormone, White said, annual hospitalizations decreased by half, from about three per year to 1.5.\n\nHGH therapy can be expensive, but fewer hospitalizations should balance out the expense.\n\n""Hopefully, this is going to encourage cystic fibrosis care providers to use it more frequently in patients at the lower end of weight and of short stature,"" Lapin said of the findings.\n\nA daily injection can be difficult for a child who is already taking several other medications, White said, but going to the hospital fewer times might make up for it.\n\n""I could see that, for a lot of kids, the injections would become just part of the daily routine,"" he said.

In women agreeing to participate, this led to a 28 per cent reduction in hip fractures over five years.\n\nProfessor Neil Gittoes, of the University of Birmingham\'s Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, said: ""Our findings showed that screening led to a statistically significant decrease in hip fractures. ""Our data has the potential to influence national policies around prevention of hip fractures, which is particularly relevant in our ageing society. The consequences of hip fractures to older people can be devastating, including impaired mobility and loss of independence. ""While we have demonstrated clinical effectiveness of screening, we are also exploring cost-effectiveness of this approach; initial analyses also look promising in this respect.""\n\nProfessor Lee Shepstone, from UEA\'s Norwich Medical School, said: ""Approximately one in three women and one in five men aged over 50 year will suffer a fragility fracture during their remaining lifetime. In the UK around 536,000 people suffer fragility fractures each year, including 79,000 hip fractures.\n\n""A hip fracture can be devastating with a loss of independence and less than one third of patients make a full recovery. Mortality at one-year post-fracture is approximately 20 per cent.""\n\n""We wanted to find out whether screening, like screening for breast cancer, could help identify those at risk of suffering a fracture.""\n\nThe team used a University of Sheffield developed tool called FRAX, which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture (a hip, spine, upper arm or lower arm fracture), to identify older women at high risk.\n\nA total of 12,483 women aged 70-85 were recruited from 100 GP practices in seven regions -Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. Half of the women were screened to compare screening with routine care.\n\nAmong those screened, treatment was subsequently recommended for one in seven women deemed at high risk of hip fracture. This recommendation was acted upon by the women and their GPs so that over three quarters of the women at high risk were on osteoporosis medications within six months of screening.\n\nWhile screening did not reduce the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures, there was strong evidence for a reduction in hip fractures.\n\nIn the screening group, there were 54 fewer women who suffered one or more hip fractures compared to the routine care group.\n\nThe study suggests that one hip fracture could be prevented for every 111 women screened and early analysis suggests the approach is likely to be cost-effective.\n\nProfessor Shepstone added: ""This is the first trial to show that a community-screening approach based on the FRAX fracture risk tool is both feasible and effective. Given that the number of costly and debilitating hip fractures are expected to increase with an ageing population, the results of this study potentially have important public health implications.""\n\nProfessor Eugene McCloskey, of the University of Sheffield, said: ""Low-cost screening with FRAX among the older population could result in effective, targeted intervention to reduce the human and socioeconomic burden of hip fractures.\n\n""If the SCOOP screening strategy was taken up in exactly the same way as in the study in all UK women aged 70-85 years, we estimate that the strategy could prevent up to 8000 hip fractures per year in the UK.

This news release describes results of a five-year study in which older women in seven areas of Britain were randomly assigned to either go through a screening procedure for osteoporosis called FRAX, or not. Women who were screened were 28% less likely to experience a hip fracture over the period of study, though their incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures was no different than that of women who were not screened.
Strengths are that this is a large, population-based randomized trial that measures important clinical endpoints. The intervention is innovative, easy to implement, and offers the possibility that screening can be conducted more efficiently.

The new study concludes that screening doesn\'t save many lives, even among women aged 50 to 69, who are at higher risk of the malignancy.\n\nScreening this postmenopausal age group for a decade reduced breast cancer deaths by a ""modest"" 10 percent, which translates to one life saved per 2,500 women who got the breast X-rays, according to the analysis of Norway\'s cancer registry. Previous studies have estimated this ""mortality benefit"" to be about 25 percent.\n\nThe new study did not look at the risks of screening - namely, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. However, the editorial said that in the United States, about 1,000 of every 2,500 women screened for a decade would have at least one false alarm, 500 of them would undergo an unnecessary biopsy, and five or more would be treated for cancers that would never have become lethal.\n\n""The test is surely a close call, a delicate balance between modest benefit and modest harm,"" H. Gilbert Welch, a Dartmouth Medical School primary-care physician, wrote in his editorial.\n\nThat message could be misinterpreted, worried Emily F. Conant, chief of breast imaging at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n""Women are looking for reasons not to get their mammograms,"" Conant said. ""We know mammography works. To cut back now, when we know how to hone and make it even better, is going back in time."" Ultrasound, MRI imaging, and digital technology are now used to clarify ambiguous mammograms.\n\nMuch of the mammography debate rests on now-outdated studies done from the 1960s through the 1980s in which women were randomly assigned to get mammograms or not.\n\nThe latest study, in contrast, uses data from Norway\'s public health-care system, which gradually phased in breast cancer screening across the country starting in 1996. (Before that, mammograms were mostly used to diagnose palpable lumps.) Unlike U.S. health plans, Norway covers the test only for women ages 50 to 69, and only every other year.\n\nThe nine-year phase-in of the program enabled researchers to tease out how much of the reduction in deaths was due to earlier cancer detection with mammography, vs. greater awareness and better treatments. The study analyzed data from more than 40,000 women of all ages who developed breast cancer in the decades before and after screening was introduced. Of these, 4,791 died of the disease.\n\nIt turned out that overall, breast cancer mortality fell 28 percent in the decade after screening began, but it dropped even among women who weren\'t getting mammograms.\n\nThe researchers concluded that 10 percent of the overall mortality reduction - about a third - was directly linked to screening, while the rest was due to better, more timely treatment, such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.\n\nLead researcher Mette Kalager, a biostatistician with Norway\'s cancer registry, speculated that the growth of screening raised awareness of the importance of checking out breast abnormalities.\n\n""We\'re actually taking better care of ourselves now than we did 20 years ago,"" she said. ""That could be a spin-off effect of screening.""\n\nLast year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force set off a controversy by issuing updated screening advice. It said women in their 40s who are at average breast cancer risk should consider forgoing mammograms because of the risk-benefit tradeoffs.\n\nGiven the latest study, Welch said, doctors and advisory groups should strive to inform women, and accept that some will opt not to be screened.\n\n""It\'s one of the few areas where doctors go beyond cajoling and become coercive,"" Welch said. ""They say, \'What, you don\'t care about your health?\' "" if a woman declines a mammogram.\n\nPreventive Services task force member Sanford Schwartz, a physician and health-care expert at the University of Pennsylvania\'s Wharton School, offered the bottom line: ""Mammograms still work, but not as well as doctors thought - and nowhere near as well as most women think.""']",Good job.  ,"



 
This story clearly outlines how a study of mammography screening in Norway feeds into debate about the value of breast cancer screening. It includes the comments of experts who have a variety of perspectives on the latest data.

But such removal is painful, makes recovery more difficult and leaves women susceptible to complications, including infections and a chronic, sometimes disabling swelling in their arms known as lymphodema.\n\nIn the new study, Armando Giuliano of the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John\'s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., and colleagues analyzed data collected from 445 women who had their nodes removed and 446 who did not, along with radiation and chemotherapy. They found no significant difference in the patients\' chances of surviving five years after their diagnosis. The five-year ""disease-free"" survival rate was 83.9 percent in those who did not have the more aggressive surgery compared with 82.2 in those who did, the researchers reported.\n\nBased on the findings, the researchers said, women who fit the criteria of those in the study probably do not need to undergo the additional surgery. The researchers noted that the study was limited to women with tumors known as T1 or T2, meaning they were relatively small, had no enlarged nodes that could be felt, and the cancer had not spread elsewhere.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Grant Walter Carlson and William Wood of Emory University in Atlanta called the study an ""important contribution"" that represents the latest development in breast cancer treatment, which has steadily been moving toward less-aggressive options, sparing women from unnecessary surgery and follow-up therapy. The study provides ""strong evidence"" that many women can safely forgo lymph node removal, they wrote.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Gary Lyman of the American Society of Clinical Oncology said the findings will probably prompt the group to revise its recommendations for breast cancer patients accordingly. The panel that issues those guidelines is currently reviewing its recommendations, he said.\n\n""I think this will be practice-changing,"" he said.\n\nAbout 60 to 70 percent of women with cancer diagnosed in lymph nodes may now opt not to have more nodes removed based on this study, meaning thousands of women would avoid the additional surgery, he said.\n\n""This is good news.

By analyzing the level of proteins within mole cells, mass spectrometry can aid in the diagnosis of atypical moles. In this study, mass spectrometry correlated better than the gold standard of histologic examination to determine if an atypical mole was in fact benign or a melanoma. Early diagnosis of melanoma is critical to cure and long term survival.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bCalifornia Skin Institute — A recently developed test for assessing suspicious moles for melanoma is more accurate than standard analyses, according to Dr. Rossitza Lazova, a former Yale investigator. The test, which analyzes proteins in cells, could provide more reliable results for clinicians with patients who might be at risk for this deadly cancer.\n\nThe study was published on August 5th in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.\n\nMelanoma is one of the most common forms of cancer and the most serious type of skin cancer. The gold standard for diagnosing melanoma is skin biopsy followed by microscopic examination of sampled tissue. However, in up to 1 in 4 cases, the results are inconclusive.\n\nFor the study, a former associate professor of Dermatology and Pathology at Yale University, Rossitza Lazova, M.D., collaborated with a national and international team of researchers to determine whether atypical moles could be more accurately diagnosed as either benign or cancerous (melanoma) using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) — a technology that enables pathologists to focus in on individual proteins within sampled skin cells. In a prior study, the researchers used IMS to identify a molecular signature comprised of five proteins to differentiate between one type of benign mole and melanoma.\n\nThe research team retrospectively analyzed more than 100 cases of atypical moles. They compared results from IMS diagnosis to results based on standard microscopic examination of biopsies and correlated them with clinical outcomes.\n\nThe researchers found that in nearly all cases, the IMS analysis was a more accurate predictor, both of benign lesions and melanomas, than standard microscopic examination.\n\n“Instead of pathologists being dependent solely upon the physical appearance of the cells, they now have the additional advantage of molecular information regarding the protein makeup [of cells] provided by mass spec imaging,” said Dr. Lazova, who is corresponding author on the study. “This test integrates anatomic pathology and analytical chemistry in a very useful and meaningful way.”\n\nThe finding suggests that IMS analysis, based on proteomic signatures, may improve both diagnosis and prediction of outcomes for patients with ambiguous moles, the researchers said.\n\nOther authors include Erin H.

IVs are one of the most common things in health care.\n\nNew research calls into question what’s in those IV bags that nearly every hospitalized patient gets.

Some doctors are hoping the results will persuade more hospitals to switch.\n\n“We’ve been sounding the alarm for 20 years” about possible harms from saline, said Dr. John Kellum, a critical care specialist at the University of Pittsburgh. “It’s purely inertia” that prevents a change, he said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nKellum had no role in the two studies, which were discussed Tuesday at a critical care conference in San Antonio and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.

For every 100 people on balanced fluids, there was one fewer death or severe kidney problem.\n\nSince there are about 30 million people hospitalized in the U.S. alone each year, “there are tens or hundreds of thousands of patients who would be spared death or severe kidney problems by using balanced fluids instead of saline,” said one study leader, Vanderbilt’s Dr. Matthew Semler.\n\nAfter seeing the results two months ago, Vanderbilt hospital officials decided to primarily use balanced fluids. The University of Pittsburgh also has largely switched to them, Kellum said.\n\nThe fluids cost about the same — a dollar or two per IV — and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive, doctors said.\n\nIV fluids have been in the news since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last fall, shutting down electricity to three plants owned by Baxter International (BAX), one of the biggest makers of these fluids.

High levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer, although it\'s far from a perfect screening tool, experts say. Men with both high and low levels of PSA can have cancer or not have cancer.\n\nThe thought was that since high PSA levels are correlated with prostate cancer, rapidly rising levels of PSA, called ""PSA velocity,"" from one year to another would also be an indicator of prostate cancer.\n\nHowever, the new study found that PSA velocity doesn\'t add any useful information beyond what physicians can already tell from other methods of prostate cancer screening, including the one-time PSA level test and digital rectal exams.\n\nCurrent screening guidelines that recommend biopsies for men who have high PSA velocity but no other signs of prostate cancer -- such as a suspected abnormality during a digital rectal exam or high PSA level during a single test -- are leading to many unnecessary biopsies, the researchers said.\n\n""We found there was no strong association between PSA velocity and prostate cancer, and virtually none with aggressive prostate cancer,"" said study author Andrew Vickers, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. ""The velocity didn\'t add anything more to detecting aggressive prostate cancers.""\n\nThe study is published online Feb. 24 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe whole issue of prostate cancer screening -- including the PSA test, the digital rectal exam and PSA velocity -- has been controversial, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nPart of the difficulty is, while current screening methods are good at detecting cancer, they can\'t distinguish between aggressive, life-threatening prostate cancers and those that are slow-growing and relatively benign. And many prostate cancers are just that -- of little risk to men during their lifetimes, Brawley said.\n\nCurrent ACS prostate screening cancer guidelines recommend that men make an informed decision with their doctor about whether to be tested for prostate cancer. ""Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment,"" according to the ACS.\n\nAs for PSA velocity, the ACS doesn\'t have a position on what PSA velocity warrants a biopsy.\n\nBut the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines do recommend biopsies based on high PSA velocities, even in the absence of an elevated PSA or a suspicious digital rectal exam, according to background information in the study.\n\nAnd many internal medicine and primary-care doctors, in part because of fears of litigation, do order biopsies based on fast-rising PSA levels, Brawley said.\n\n""It\'s something that has become almost a community standard. If a guy has a PSA of .8 last year, and a year or so later you\'ve repeated it and it\'s 1.9, because it has increased by a factor of 1 he gets sent to biopsy,"" Brawley said.\n\nIn the study, researchers used data on more than 5,500 men in their 60s and 70s who took part in a drug trial for a prostate cancer prevention drug. The men in the study were all from the placebo arm, meaning they had not received the drug. As part of the trial, all of the men agreed to have a biopsy at the end of the trial, needed or not.\n\nResearchers did find a statistical association between PSA velocity and the chances of a biopsy coming back cancerous. But when they factored in other things that can influence risk, including a family history of the disease, being older, being black, PSA level and results of a digital rectal exam, there was virtually no association between PSA velocity and biopsy outcome.\n\n""PSA velocity measurement is not useful,"" Brawley said.\n\nGrace Lu-Yao, a cancer epidemiologist at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey who wrote an accompanying editorial, said she agreed with the authors\' conclusions that PSA velocity does not seem to be a good predictor of prostate cancer.\n\nIn addition, tracking PSA levels overtime can also cause anxiety to men, who often worry if their PSA level has suddenly shot up.\n\n""According to the data, PSA velocity does not add any value, but it may add more anxiety,"" Lu-Yao said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has more on the PSA test.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Generally good job reporting on an important study that raises more questions about what rising PSA levels mean or don’t mean.

Vemurafenib is designed for use in patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow. About half of all melanomas have the genetic aberration.\n\nThe Roche trial included 675 patients with previously untreated, inoperable late-stage metastatic melanoma with the BRAF mutation.\n\nAfter a median three months of treatment, vemurafenib patients also had a 74 percent reduction in the risk of cancer progression compared to dacarbazine.\n\n“This is a huge difference,” said Dr. Antoni Ribas, an oncologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied vemurafenib. “Even if it diminishes over time, who cares?”\n\n“Nearly half of patients treated with the Roche drug had tumor shrinkage, compared with 5.5 percent with chemotherapy.\n\nSide effects included skin rashes and joint pain. About 18 percent of patients developed a low-grade skin cancer.\n\nMore than 70,000 people in the United States and 160,000 worldwide are diagnosed with melanoma each year, according to the American Cancer Society. The five-year survival rate for the aggressive cancer is just 15 percent.\n\nAnalysts, on average, have forecast annual vemurafenib sales of $452 million by 2015 and expect Yervoy annual sales of $1.26 billion, according to Thomson Pharma.\n\nISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said although the vemurafenib results look the most encouraging, the findings are unlikely to make a difference for current sales estimates, since virtually all eligible patients will be treated with both drugs, either in sequence or in combination.\n\nMORE HELP FOR MELANOMA PATIENTS\n\nRoche expects U.S. and European regulators to decide on approval of its drug before the end of the year.\n\nBristol-Myers’ Yervoy was approved in March for patients with inoperable or metastatic melanoma, based on a previous study which showed the drug given alone extended survival by four months in patients who had failed other treatments.\n\n“What was interesting about this study was not only was it the second one to show a benefit,” but that the improvement “took place even in the presence of dacarbazine chemotherapy,” Dr. Jedd Wolchok of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who presented the study at the meeting, said in a telephone interview.\n\n“We worried a lot that chemotherapy could be immunosuppressive,” Wolchok said, noting that that might explain why the average survival benefit was two months instead of four.\n\n“We don’t know what dacarbazine did to the ipilimumab, but we do know even in the presence of dacarbazine, ipilimumab still produced a durable response and extended survival.”\n\nDoctors said taken together the new studies offer new options for patients.\n\n“This is really unprecedented time to have two new approaches to treat advanced melanoma,” said Dr. Lynn Schuchter of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, a melanoma expert who moderated a panel discussion of the drugs.\n\n“Once you finally understand what is driving the disease we can develop therapies that are more effective,” she said.\n\nShe and others expect vemurafenib to be approved this year. Meanwhile, doctors are already working out treatment strategies.\n\nFor patients who are stable with slow-growing tumors, Chapman said he would start them off on ipilimumab.\n\n“That is a drug that can take a while to work, so if the person has time I would rather give him essentially two shots on goal rather than one.”\n\nFor advanced patients who need a quick response, he would use vemurafenib first.\n\nSchuchter, who was not involved with the studies, said now the future is going to be to build upon this success and combine therapies.\n\n“Cancer cells outwit us — they are brilliant — and figure out other pathways,” she said.\n\nBristol-Myers and Roche announced earlier this week a collaboration to evaluate the combination of Yervoy and vemurafenib as a therapy for metastatic melanoma.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Despite the four-star score, there were at least two significant shortcomings in this story – yet both could be easily addressed. </span>","No discussion of drug costs – which are substantial.

Now he and his colleagues are testing to see whether hip patients also can benefit from it.\n\nIt is much less invasive than a knee or hip replacement, and typically is performed on an outpatient basis, Vasileff said.\n\nThe procedure involves a smaller incision than joint replacement surgery, so there\'s less risk of infection, and a quicker recovery time that means fewer of the side effects associated with being bedridden, Vasileff said.\n\nHowever, subchondroplasty is only feasible in a narrow range of patients. Those with full-blown bone-on-bone arthritis or joint pain caused by damage to the cartilage and ligaments will get little to no relief from the procedure, Vasileff said.\n\n""People who have significant arthritis where the cartilage itself is damaged and thinned, this isn\'t going to fix the arthritis,"" Vasileff said.

""The fact I was able to keep all my bones and joints in there was quite a surprise.""\n\nSubchondroplasty has shown solid potential, but orthopedic surgeon Dr. Matthew Hepinstall is concerned that it might be ""oversold"" to desperate patients who want to avoid joint replacement surgery.\n\n""The claims that are being made are not evidence-based yet, although they are intellectually appealing,"" said Hepinstall. He is associate director of the Center for Joint Preservation & Reconstruction at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City.\n\n""It\'s just important not to oversell this,"" he added.\n\nThe best candidates for the procedure are patients who still have some cartilage protecting their joint, but have somehow ""overloaded"" and injured the bone, causing swelling and pain, Hepinstall said.\n\n""If you inject this substance into the bone, you\'re basically providing internal support, a scaffold protecting the bone. That can theoretically reduce bone pain,"" Hepinstall noted.\n\n""The appealing thing about it is instead of going in and resurfacing a damaged joint, you\'re injecting something to help the bone, but keeping the patient\'s own anatomy,"" Hepinstall continued.\n\n""But there\'s a very narrow window of patients who are good ideal candidates for this, who basically have a real overload of their bone causing severe enough pain to warrant a surgical procedure, but also have healthy enough cartilage that doing something about the bone swelling is going to alleviate the majority of their pain,"" he stressed.\n\n""We don\'t want to send the message to people who have bone-on-bone, with big bone spurs and limited range of motion that they\'re all of a sudden going to get relief from injecting a little bit of cement into their bone,"" Hepinstall said. ""This is for people who have basically a normal joint that has normal range of motion and normal stability, just a little thinning of the cartilage.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on knee pain, visit the Arthritis Foundation.']","When it comes to an up-and-coming procedure like this, it’s buyer beware.","This story describes a minimally invasive procedure using bone cement that may offer pain relief to people suffering from some forms of knee and hip arthritis.

(Jan. 3, 2016) - Deregulation and inhibition of the immune system contributes to cancer development. Many therapeutic strategies aim to re-stimulate the immune system to recognize cancer cells and target them for destruction. Researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center report that a dendritic cell vaccine that targets the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells is safe and effectively stimulates the immune system leading to regression of early-stage breast cancer.\n\nThe HER2 protein is overexpressed in 20-25% of all breast cancer tumors and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Researchers have previously shown that immune cells are less able to recognize and target cancer cells that express HER2 as breast cancer progresses into a more advanced and invasive stage. This suggests that strategies that can restimulate the immune system to recognize and target HER2 early during cancer development may be effective treatment options.\n\nThe researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells. Their approach involves creating the vaccine from immune cells called dendritic cells that are harvested from each individual patient to create a personalized vaccine.\n\nIn order to determine if the HER2-dendritic cell vaccine is safe and effective, the researchers performed a clinical trial in 54 women who have HER2-expressing early-stage breast cancer. The dendritic cell vaccines were prepared by isolating dendritic cells from each patients\' blood and exposing them to fragments of the HER2 protein. Patients were injected with a dose of their personal dendritic cell vaccine once a week for 6 weeks into either a lymph node, the breast tumor, or into both sites.\n\nThe researchers report that the dendritic cell vaccines were well-tolerated and patients only experienced low-grade toxicities. The most common adverse events were fatigue, injection site reactions, and chills. They also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients. Approximately 80% of evaluable patients had a detectable immune response in their peripheral blood and/or in their sentinel lymph node wherein their cancer is most likely to spread to first. Importantly, the immune responses among the patients were similar, regardless of the route of vaccine administration.\n\nThe Moffitt researchers assessed the effectiveness of the vaccine by determining the percentage of patients who had detectable disease within surgical specimens after resection. The absence of disease is termed a pathological complete response (pCR). They report that 13 patients achieved a pCR and patients who had early non-invasive disease called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) achieved a higher rate of pCR than patients who had early-stage invasive disease. Interestingly, patients who achieved a pCR had a higher immune response within their local sentinel lymph nodes.\n\n""These results suggest that vaccines are more effective in DCIS, thereby warranting further evaluation in DCIS or other minimal disease settings, and the local regional sentinel lymph node may serve as a more meaningful immunologic endpoint,"" said Brian J. Czerniecki, MD, PhD, Chair of the Department of Breast Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center.\n\n###\n\nThe study was published in the December 13th online issue of Clinical Cancer Research and was supported by funds received from R01-CA096997, P30-CA016520, Pennies-in-Action®, and the Henle Foundation.\n\nAbout Moffitt Cancer Center\n\nMoffitt is dedicated to one lifesaving mission: to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.

The study’s main goal was to compare the safety and immune responses using varying routes of vaccination, including a lymph node, a breast tumor, or both. The news release quantifies some benefits and mentions harms, but it doesn’t spell out costs, availability or study limitations, leaving the reader to wonder why these findings are significant. The headline of a “promising” treatment for early stage breast cancer patients isn’t supported by the facts.

Most of these men, who all had terminal prostate cancer with limited treatment options, had disease control lasting much longer than expected in this group of patients.\n\nThe results have led on to the start of TOPARP-B, a second part of this trial in which only men whose prostate cancers have detectable DNA repair mutations will receive olaparib. If the results are successful, olaparib could become a standard treatment option for men with advanced prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations.\n\nThe development of olaparib, which is now owned by AstraZeneca, was underpinned by scientific research carried out with funding from Cancer Research UK at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the University of Cambridge, and clinical trials led by the ICR and The Royal Marsden, and other institutions in the UK and overseas. It has had particularly strong results in phase III trials in patients who inherited mutations to the BRCA genes, many of whom had breast or ovarian cancer.\n\nThe drug, a type of treatment called a PARP inhibitor, was licensed last year for women with ovarian cancer and inherited BRCA mutations, but so far has not been approved for use on the NHS by NICE or the Cancer Drugs Fund.\n\nTrial chief investigator Professor Johann de Bono, Head of Drug Development at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:\n\n""Our trial marks a significant step forward in the treatment of prostate cancer, showing that olaparib is highly effective at treating men with DNA repair defects in their tumours. It also proves the principle that we can detect prostate cancers with specific targetable mutations using genomic sequencing to deliver more precise cancer care by matching treatment to those men most likely to benefit.\n\n""I hope it won\'t be long before we are using olaparib in the clinic to treat prostate cancer, or before genomic stratification of cancers becomes a standard in this and other cancers.""\n\nStudy co-leader Dr Emma Hall, Deputy Director of the Cancer Research UK-funded Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, which co-ordinated the study, said:\n\n""This phase II clinical trial combined a highly targeted cancer drug with cutting-edge genomic sequencing. We showed that a subset of men whose tumours had mutations in their DNA repair machinery responded particularly well to treatment with olaparib. The next trial includes only men with these mutations in their tumours, with the aim of proving that olaparib is highly effective for them.""\n\nDr Aine McCarthy, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said:\n\n""Even though the number of men surviving prostate cancer is increasing, it\'s still the second most common cause of cancer death in UK men. This is partly because the disease is so hard to treat once it has spread around the body.\n\n""This trial is exciting because it could offer a new way to treat prostate cancer by targeting genetic mistakes in cancers that have spread. The hope is that this approach could help save many more lives in the future.""\n\nHoward R. Soule, PhD, executive vice president and chief science officer of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, said:\n\n""TOPARP-A is significant because it exploits the genetic similarities of prostate, breast and ovarian cancers,"" said. ""We are excited about this pioneering study because it demonstrates the tremendous crossover and wider applications in the research on these diseases.""\n\nDr. William Nelson, co-vice chair of the SU2C Scientific Advisory Committee and director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland, said:\n\n""Understanding the link between prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations is incredibly important for patients and their families. We can identify prostate cancer patients who will benefit from drugs like olaparib and also help men and their families better understand their genetic risk of metastatic prostate cancer, just as women with BRCA mutations do for breast and ovarian cancer.""\n\n###\n\nNotes to editors\n\nFor more information contact Henry French on 020 7153 5582 / henry.french@icr.ac.uk.

While the news release indicates that this is pioneering work in the field of personalized prostate cancer treatment, there is still much to be skeptical about the practice of isolating cancer-related genes with new targeted drugs. The key point not made in the news release is that the study did not demonstrate any mortality or survival benefit in the act of identifying and targeting men with mutated prostate tumors and giving them olarparib.
The news release comes across somewhat as a promotional vehicle for genetic testing and yet comparing it with the test for BRAC (breast cancer susceptibility gene) mutation would tend to give it a gloss it might not deserve. Without results with this form of  “precision medicine,” hyping genetic testing around this type of metastatic prostate cancer feels a little irresponsible. The final line: “Understanding the link between prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations is incredibly important for patients and their families” seems to be putting the cart way before the horse and is likely to confuse and build unreasonable expectations among prostate cancer sufferers.

As part of the survey, female participants had blood testing for iron deficiency as well as hemoglobin testing to identify anemia.\n\nWomen are typically tested some time in their teens for anemia -- the severe form of iron deficiency -- using a quick and affordable hemoglobin test. However, iron deficiency can develop years before anemia and can be missed by hemoglobin testing alone.\n\n""If you think about your car, you have to run your gas tank all the way down before the red light goes on, and that\'s similar to the way we\'re screening for iron deficiency,"" said Deepa L. Sekhar, physician and associate professor of pediatrics. ""We\'re basically waiting until their red light goes on. You have to be really low on your iron storage before you\'re going to flag as anemic.""\n\nIron deficiency without anemia has been associated with lower standardized math scores, attention deficit disorder and restless leg syndrome in children and adolescents. Among iron-deficient adolescent women there is a future risk of maternal iron deficiency and negative effects on infant health.\n\nBlood tests for iron deficiency without anemia have been developed but they are more costly and difficult to obtain in the doctor\'s office compared to hemoglobin testing for anemia. Sekhar and colleagues hoped to determine risk factors for iron deficiency without anemia that could pinpoint which women could benefit most from this more costly testing.\n\nIn the first study, when the researchers analyzed the NHANES study data, 9 percent of females who were 12 to 21 years old had iron deficiency without anemia. The researchers then looked at potential iron deficiency risk factors in this group, including the age when they started menstruating, as well as their race and ethnicity, poverty status, food insecurity, tobacco or nicotine use, dietary information, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity.\n\nAll of these factors have been associated with iron deficiency anemia in women in prior studies. However, the only risk factor significantly associated with iron deficiency without anemia in young women in this study was having had a period for more than three years. The research was recently published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nIn a second study, the researchers next looked at whether a specially developed questionnaire could better predict iron status. Questions were included on depression, poor attention and daytime sleepiness, symptoms which all have been associated with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia, but were not captured in the prior NHANES analyses. This questionnaire was compared to the currently recommended four iron deficiency anemia-risk questions in the Bright Futures Adolescent Previsit Questionnaire, a survey recommended for physician use by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNinety-six female adolescents participated in this study, published in The Journal of Pediatrics. The Bright Futures questions alone did not predict iron deficiency or anemia. Yet, the researchers\' risk assessment questionnaire was equally poor.\n\nTaken together, the studies suggest that risk factors and assessments should not be used to determine which young women should receive testing for iron deficiency.\n\n""The questions aren\'t predictive,"" Sekhar said. ""I think we need to establish the optimal timing for an objective assessment of adolescent iron deficiency and anemia.""\n\nSekhar believes the appropriate age may be 16 years old, when most females will have been menstruating for at least three years.\n\nIn addition to timing, further research will be needed to determine which blood test for iron deficiency without anemia is accurate, cost-efficient and practical for routine doctor\'s office use. This test should be given with hemoglobin testing to catch all young women on the spectrum of iron deficiency, Sekhar said.\n\nIron deficiency can be corrected with dietary changes and supplementation, Sekhar added.\n\n###\n\nOther researchers on the study in PLOS ONE were Laura E. Murray-Kolb, in the Department of Nutritional Sciences, Allen R. Kunselman in the Department of Public Health Sciences, Carol S. Weisman in the Departments of Public Health Sciences and Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Ian M. Paul in the Departments of Pediatrics and Public Health Sciences, all at Penn State.\n\nThis research received $62,500 of federal funding from The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health (grant number K12HD055882), which funded 100 percent of the project.\n\nMurray-Kolb and Paul also worked on the study in The Journal of Pediatrics, along with Eric W. Schaefer, a biostatistician in the Department of Public Health Sciences. Non-government funding from Sackler Institute for Nutrition Science of the New York Academy of Sciences provided 100 percent of funding for this research project.']",The release declares that doctors should screen all teen women for iron deficiency but this conclusion seems beyond the scope of the two studies.,"This release reports on two separate studies, one combing the medical histories and records of more than 6,000 women, and another where 96 patients were surveyed. In the first study, researchers found that a significant number of young women had iron deficiency that wasn’t quite as severe as anemia. In the second study, they tried to find a way to predict who might have iron deficiency by asking about fatigue and other factors, but were unable to find a predictive question. The release declares that doctors should screen all teens for “iron deficiency” but this conclusion seems beyond the scope of the two studies. Finding teens who may suffer health issues from iron deficiency is a great goal. However, whether universal screening is the best way requires further research.

""Our preliminary results are a first step in developing much-needed empirical data for clinicians and caregivers on how to use technology such as tablets as tools to enhance care and also for app developers working to serve the technologic needs of this population.""\n\n""Use of Tablet Devices in the Management of Agitation Among Inpatients with Dementia: An Open Label Study"" was recently published in the online version of The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. By using tablet devices to employ these therapies, however, patients and providers also benefit from a computer\'s inherent flexibility.\n\n""The biggest advantage is versatility,"" said Vahia. ""We know that art therapy can work, music therapy can work. The tablet, however, gives you the option of switching from one app to another easily, modifying the therapy seamlessly to suit the individual. You don\'t need to invest in new equipment or infrastructure.""\n\nResearchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The apps were freely available on iTunes and varied greatly in their cognitive complexity--from an app that displayed puppy photos to one that featured Sudoku puzzles.\n\nThe researchers found that tablet use was safe for every patient, regardless of the severity of their dementia, and that with proper supervision and training, the engagement rate with the devices was nearly 100 percent. The study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation, particularly--but not exclusively--among patients with milder forms of dementia.\n\nVahia cited several examples of the tablet\'s potential to improve a patient\'s condition. One particular patient, who only spoke Romanian, was very withdrawn and irritable, and medications were ineffective in controlling his symptoms.\n\n""We started showing him Romanian video clips on YouTube, and his behavior changed dramatically and instantaneously,"" said Vahia. ""His mood improved. He became more interactive. He and his medical support team also started using a translation app so that staff could ask him simple questions in Romanian, facilitating increased interaction. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet\'s potential as a clinical tool.""\n\nBased on such promising outcomes, the Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Services clinical team is expanding the use of tablet devices as a means to control agitation in dementia patients at McLean. This will allow researchers to develop more robust data and expand the scope of the study, including a focus on specific clinical factors that may impact how patients with dementia engage with and respond to apps.\n\n###\n\nAbout McLean Hospital\n\nMcLean Hospital is the largest psychiatric affiliate of Harvard Medical School and a member of Partners HealthCare. In addition to providing a full continuum of psychiatric clinical care, McLean maintains the largest neuroscience and psychiatry research program of any private psychiatric hospital in the United States. McLean\'s robust research program is backed by more than $40 million in funding from a variety of sources, including foundations, private contributors, National Institutes of Health, United States Department of Defense, and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Without using much measurement, the study concluded that the apps provided some reduction in symptoms of agitation for these residents. Although the release offered little in the way of quantification, it took pains to explain that the study was a pilot to demonstrate feasibility and that the intervention is “potentially effective” in addressing agitation in residents of nursing care facilities.

Dr. Uzma Samadani, who recently joined the faculty at Hennepin County Medical Center, in collaboration with researchers at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Veterans Center at NYU Langone Medical Center, developed the technology that can serve as a biomarker for concussion by tracking patients\' eye movements as they watch music videos.\n\nThe eye tracking technology works by having patients watch a music video for 220 seconds while eye movements are measured using a tracking camera. Videos used in the study ranged from Disney\'s Puss in Boots to Wavin Flag by K\'Naan. Multiple measures of each eye\'s movement, followed by comparisons of their positions over time are used to distinguish between normal subjects and those with concussion.\n\nIn the work, led by Uzma Samadani, MD PhD, Charles Marmar, MD, and Eugene Laska PhD, the investigators built a classifier based on 34 emergency room patients with brain injury and 34 uninjured healthy control subjects of similar age. A classifier is a mathematical model that converts a patient\'s eye movement measures into a prediction of the concussive status of the individual. They then tested the models on a dataset of 255 subjects, of whom 8 had concussions, and found that the eye tracking test had an optimal sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 87%.\n\nTypically, a classifier produces a score and a subject is classified as having a concussion if the score exceeds a predefined threshold value. The accuracy of a biomarker is measured by plotting the probability of a true versus false positivity at each possible threshold value and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is computed. A perfect biomarker has an AUC of 1.00, while a worthless marker - no better than the chance toss of a coin - has an AUC of 0.50. Most tests used clinically have AUC\'s greater than 0.80. For example, serum troponin, the most commonly performed blood test for heart attacks has an AUC ranging in various studies from 0.76 to 0.96. In this study, the eye tracking based classifier had an AUC of 0.88, and a cross-validated AUC of 0.85.\n\nAccording to Dr. Samadani, the major challenge for any technology proposed as a biomarker for concussion is first defining concussion. ""When doctors look for a biomarker for heart attack, it is relatively easy to check the accuracy of a potential candidate because they can perform a cardiac catheterization and confirm that the heart vessel is blocked and an attack has occurred. There is no analogous capability with brain injury – there is no gold standard diagnostic, no blood test, and no imaging study for definitively concluding that a patient has experienced a concussion. We use symptom severity scales and standardized cognitive examination assessments but the imperfect nature of these may result in incorrect subject classification. Potentially, eye tracking may be more accurate than it appears, because of its objective appraisal of a complicated process of coordination that may be impaired.""\n\n\n\nThe investigators defined concussion as (1) trauma to the head with a normal CT (computed tomography) scan of the brain, (2) symptom severity score of 40 or greater on SCAT3 testing and (3) standardized assessment of concussion (SAC) score less than 24. The symptom severity score measures the self-reported severity of 22 concussion symptoms ranging from headache to dizziness and irritability. The SAC measures orientation, memory, and concentration – capabilities which have some variability even among uninjured healthy control subjects.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial that also appears in the journal, Dr. Samadani proposes that eye tracking will help diagnose and classify brain injury and concussion, particularly in patients with elevated pressure inside their skulls and disruption of pathways in the brain that control eye movements.\n\n\n\n""The ultimate goal for brain injury,"" said Dr. Samadani, ""is to achieve the same level of diagnostic capability and care as currently exists for other medical conditions. Right now when someone comes in to the emergency room with chest pain, doctors perform an EKG, blood test, imaging, and treatment. With brain injury we need to be able to achieve the same level of care – to assess all aspects of the problem rigorously, classify, and treat accordingly. We already know that there is much more to brain injury than what is seen on a CT scan. Eye tracking tells us how well the brain is working regardless of how it looks, and represents the beginning of a solution to this problem. It is non-invasive, inexpensive and extremely quick. Testing does not require reading nor language skills which makes it useful for multiple patient populations.""\n\nCommenting further on the study was Dr. David Cifu, the Herman J. Flax, M.D. Professor and Chair of Rehabilitation at Virginia Commonwealth University, Senior TBI Specialist with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Principal Investigator of the VA/Department of Defense Chronic Effects of NeuroTrauma Consortium.\n\n""This innovative research by Samadani and colleagues highlights a novel approach to objectively and rapidly support the diagnosis of acute concussion using a novel technique of assessing eye tracking. This publication may represent the first step in the development of a more exacting method of diagnosing and monitoring recovery from traumatic brain injury. Computerized assessment of eye tracking may represent the first truly useful biomarker of TBI.""\n\n\n\nBrain injury is the number one cause of death and disability in Americans under age 35, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Every year, 1.4 million people suffer from a traumatic brain injury in the United States. Of those, 50,000 die and 235,000 require hospital admission.

Even if an injury does not occur, the fear of falling can lead to reduced activity and a loss of independence.\n\nResearch has shown that vitamin D plays a key role in maintaining muscle integrity and strength and some studies suggest vitamin D may reduce the risk of falls.\n\nHomebound elderly, a generally vulnerable population due to poor dietary intake and nutrition-related health conditions as well as decreased exposure to sunlight, are at increased risk for low vitamin D levels, possibly leading to more falls.\n\nResearchers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center set out to evaluate the feasibility of delivering a vitamin D supplement through a Meals-on-Wheels (MOW) program to improve the clients\' vitamin D levels and reduce falls.\n\nThe study is published in the early online edition (8/16/2015) of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.\n\n""Falls in homebound older people often lead to disability and placement in a nursing home,"" said Denise Houston, Ph.D., R.D., associate professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest Baptist and lead author of the study. ""One or our aging center\'s goals is to help people maintain their independence and live safely at home for as long as possible.""\n\nParticipants in the Meals-on-Wheels program in Forsyth County, North Carolina, were recruited to take part in a five-month, single-blind randomized trial.\n\nSixty-eight study participants received either a monthly vitamin D supplement of 100,000 international units or placebo delivered with their MOW meal. The study included the participants\' history of falls and their fear of falling, blood tests at the beginning and at end of the trial to measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D (biomarker for vitamin D in blood), and a monthly diary recording falls during the trial period.\n\nAt the beginning of this pilot study, the research team found that more than half of the participants had insufficient concentrations of vitamin D in the blood (less than 20 ng/ml), while less than a quarter had concentrations in the optimal range (30 ng/ml or more).\n\nThe study showed that the monthly vitamin D supplement was effective in increasing the concentrations of vitamin D in the blood from insufficient to sufficient levels in all but one of the 34 people who received it, and to optimal levels in all but five people. In addition, people in the vitamin D group reported approximately half the falls of those in the control group.\n\n""Although these initial findings are encouraging, we need to confirm the results in a larger trial,"" Houston said.\n\nThe Wake Forest Baptist team currently is conducting a clinical trial to try to determine how vitamin D affects risk factors for falls such as balance and muscle strength and power.\n\n###\n\nFunding for the study was provided by the Wake Forest Translational Science Institute and Center for Integrative Medicine and the Claude Pepper Older Americans Independence Center of Wake Forest Baptist.\n\nCo-authors are Janet Tooze, Ph.D., Jamehl Demons, M.D., Brooke Davis, M.S., Rachel Shertzer-Skinner, M.A., Stephen Kritchevsky, Ph.D., and Jeff Williamson, M.D., of Wake Forest Baptist; and Linda Kearsley, B.S., Senior Services Inc., Winston-Salem.']",A reasonably solid and succinct description of a study on vitamin D and falls. Better framing of the statistics would have helped readers interpret the results.,"This release started out very strong in describing the major findings of a study of vitamin D for preventing falls — an issue of critical importance to the nation’s growing universe of senior citizens and the people who care for them. The release offers a clear summary of the problem and intervention.  It also describes the intermediate endpoint (raising vitamin D levels) and the clinically important endpoint (falls). It would have been stronger if it had given the absolute reduction in fall risk (we need to know the fall rate in the control or intervention group to figure out how important the 50% reduction mentioned in the story would be), discussed cost and harm, and told us more about prior similar research.

The diet is aimed primarily at people with irritable bowel syndrome, a common condition in which abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits — with diarrhea, constipation or both — can wax and wane for years.\n\nFollowers are asked to eliminate, and then try to reintroduce, a long list of foods containing certain carbohydrates that might trigger gas, bloating, pain and diarrhea. FODMAP is an acronym for those carbohydrates: fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols.\n\nThe theory is that FODMAPs, found in many fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy foods and sweeteners, are poorly digested by susceptible people. The undigested carbohydrates can draw extra fluid into the digestive tract and end up in the colon, where they are “feasted upon” and fermented by gut microbes, leading to all sorts of misery, says Lauren Van Dam, a registered dietitian at the University of Michigan.\n\nIf giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. “We have some patients that are literally housebound because they are worried they are going to have an accident or because they have terrible pain,” Van Dam says.\n\nBarbara DeLancey, a 63-year-old registered nurse from Ann Arbor, says she was crippled by 10-times-a-day diarrhea when she agreed to try the diet a year ago. “I was resistant at first because it seemed so restrictive,” she says. She got teary-eyed at the grocery store, seeing all the food she could not have.\n\nBut eventually she learned she could tolerate and add back some favorites, including garlic and apples. She credits the diet, along with medication, with a big reduction in her symptoms, but says “it has not been a miracle cure.”\n\nThe diet has generated enough interest to prompt some food companies to introduce low-FODMAP products — hoping for a market surpassing that for gluten-free foods, according to some industry reports.\n\nIn 2014, IBS treatment guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology said the diet showed promise, but that the quality of evidence was “very low.""\n\nSince then, several studies have strengthened the case for the diet, says guideline co-author Brian Lacy, a professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, N.H. Still, one study from Sweden showed no advantage over a less-restrictive dietary approach that eliminates fewer foods and stresses changes such as smaller, more frequent meals.\n\n""The data are not overwhelming,” Lacy says. “But I think it’s a reasonable thing to try.”\n\nThe largest study so far, with 92 patients, was conducted at University of Michigan. It found that 52% of low-FODMAP patients and 41% of patients on a less-restrictive diet reported “adequate relief.” The difference was not statistically significant, says study co-author William Chey, a professor of gastroenterology. But low-FODMAP patients did get significantly better relief from pain and bloating and greater gains in mood, body image and overall quality of life, he says.\n\nMedications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say.\n\nIt’s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run — especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians.\n\n“Physicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,” Chey says. Ideally, all would be referred to dietitians, Chey and Lacy agree. But few dietitians are trained in the diet, and insurers typically do not cover the visits, Lacy notes.\n\nWhen patients do make their way to Kate Scarlata, a Boston area registered dietitian who specializes in the diet, the first thing she tells them is that it “is a dietary experiment. It’s a short-term learning diet.”\n\nVan Dam does the same — explaining that after a few weeks she will help clients reintroduce foods one carbohydrate category at a time.\n\n“Most are able to identify some high-FODMAP foods they can tolerate very well and some they can tolerate a little, but not in high portions every day,” she says. “Our goal is for them to be on the most varied, nutritious diet possible.”\n\nThe trickiest part is avoiding onions and garlic, the dietitians say. They teach clients strategies such as using (safe) garlic-infused oils, avoiding restaurant sauces and soups and topping salads with oil and vinegar.\n\nMapping FODMAP\n\nHigh- and low-FODMAP food lists are updated frequently at websites and apps run by the University of Michigan and Monash University in Australia.\n\nHere is a sampling from the Michigan site. (Note: the site receives funding from Nestle Health Science, which is marketing low-FODMAP products).\n\nFoods to avoid\n\nDairy: Milk, ice cream, yogurt, cottage and ricotta cheeses (except for lactose-free versions)\n\nFruits: Apples, peaches, pears, watermelon, cherries, figs\n\nVegetables: Garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, cauliflower or large servings (more than ½ cup) of broccoli and Brussels sprouts\n\nGrains: Wheat (except in sourdough bread), rye, barley\n\nLegumes and nuts: Cashews, kidney beans, soy beans and soy milk\n\nSweeteners: Honey, fructose, xylitol, agave syrup\n\nFoods to include\n\nDairy and dairy substitutes: Kefir, almond milk, coconut milk\n\nFruits: Bananas, blueberries, grapes, oranges, strawberries\n\nVegetables: Carrots, green beans, bell peppers, potatoes, tomatoes\n\nGrains: Rice, oats, gluten-free bread (but check labels for high-FODMAP ingredients)\n\nLegumes and nuts: Peanuts, pecans, walnuts\n\nSweeteners: Cane sugar, aspartame, stevia']","While we appreciate the cautionary signals sent by this story, we would have moved them much higher in the text.","This story focuses on a dietary pattern that has been around for years but is experiencing increased awareness and clinical use: the low-FODMAP diet. “FODMAP” stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, types of short-chain carbohydrates that may be poorly absorbed by the small intestine, leading to bloating, constipation and abdominal pain.
Filled with caution and caveats, the story makes it clear that existing studies of the diet’s efficacy are small and, when taken in the aggregate, inconclusive–yet intriguing enough that some people (and dietitians) are giving it a try.
While we appreciate the cautionary signals sent by this story, we would have moved them much higher in the text. As written, initial story graphs maintain a fairly neutral tone and are followed by a testimonial that puts the low-FODMAP diet on the “success-ish” side of the ledger. It is not until the second half of the story that the cautions and caveats emerge.

Roche, in an emailed statement, said it plans to discuss the data with health authorities but did not disclose the timing for the discussions. According to the FDA approval letter, the company has until December to submit the full trial data to the agency.\n\nMerck filed in February for FDA approval of Keytruda for both initial and secondary treatment of advanced urothelial cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer. Keytruda is already approved for treating melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nMerck announced in October that the second-line bladder cancer study met its main goal and was stopped early. The company is currently enrolling patients in a phase three trial of Keytruda, combined with chemotherapy, as an initial treatment for bladder cancer.\n\nIn addition to Tecentriq’s approval for bladder cancer patients whose disease has stopped responding to chemotherapy, the FDA last month approved the Roche drug as an initial treatment for people with a specific type of advanced bladder cancer and in people whose cancer progressed despite at least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.\n\nThe agency has also granted contingent approval to AstraZeneca Plc’s Imfinzi, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo and Bavencio, developed by Pfizer Inc and Merck KGaA, as second-line bladder cancer treatments.\n\nAll five drugs are part of a new class of treatments designed to unleash the body’s immune system to fight cancer by interfering with proteins known as PD-1 or PD-L1 that help malignant cells evade immune attack.\n\nMerck said data from an open-label Phase 3 trial of 542 advanced bladder cancer patients showed median survival of 10.3 months for Keytruda patients and 7.4 months for patients given second-line chemotherapy. The study’s median follow-up was 18.5 months.\n\nAfter 18 months, 36 percent of Keytruda patients were alive, compared with 20.5 percent of chemotherapy patients, according to research published by ASCO.\n\nThe study did not detect a difference in the length of time patients lived without their disease getting worse.\n\nSevere side effects were reported in 16.5 percent of the Keytruda patients, compared with nearly half of the chemotherapy group.']",Details that patients care about–such as the incredibly steep price tag and potential for adverse effects–didn’t get much attention in this story.,"Cancer immunotherapy drugs are big business, and many news sites feverishly report whatever drug companies send out about the latest clinical trials–even before the data can be verified by outside parties. Such is the case with this story from Reuters, which reports on a phase 3 trial for Keytruda, an immunotherapy drug.
We liked that the story included absolute numbers on the performance of the drug–readers can read between the lines and see that survival improved by just three months. Yet the story skirted over some key details, notably how expensive this drug is.

This amount of zinc is equivalent to what biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat can add to the diet of vulnerable, nutrient deficient populations.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, was led by CHORI Senior Scientist Janet King, PhD. King and her team are the first to show that a modest increase in dietary zinc reduces oxidative stress and damage to DNA.\n\n""We were pleasantly surprised to see that just a small increase in dietary zinc can have such a significant impact on how metabolism is carried out throughout the body,"" says King. ""These results present a new strategy for measuring the impact of zinc on health and reinforce the evidence that food-based interventions can improve micronutrient deficiencies worldwide.""\n\nZinc is ubiquitous in our body and facilitates many functions that are essential for preserving life. It plays a vital role in maintaining optimal childhood growth, and in ensuring a healthy immune system. Zinc also helps limit inflammation and oxidative stress in our body, which are associated with the onset of chronic cardiovascular diseases and cancers.\n\nAround much of the world, many households eat polished white rice or highly refined wheat or maize flours, which provide energy but do not provide enough essential micronutrients such as zinc. Zinc is an essential part of nearly 3,000 different proteins, and it impacts how these proteins regulate every cell in our body. In the absence of sufficient zinc, our ability to repair everyday wear and tear on our DNA is compromised.\n\nIn the randomized, controlled, six-week study the scientists measured the impact of zinc on human metabolism by counting DNA strand breaks. They used the parameter of DNA damage to examine the influence of a moderate amount of zinc on healthy living. This was a novel approach, different from the commonly used method of looking at zinc in the blood or using stunting and morbidity for assessing zinc status.\n\nAccording to King, these results are relevant to the planning and evaluation of food-based solutions for mitigating the impact of hidden hunger and malnutrition. King believes that biofortification can be a sustainable, long-term solution to zinc deficiency.\n\n###\n\nIn addition to King, the study\'s other authors are Sarah J Zyba, Swapna V Shenvi, David W Killilea, Tai C Holland, Elijah Kim, Adrian Moy, Barbara Sutherland, Virginia Gildengorin, and Mark K Shigenaga, conducting the research at CHORI\'s Nutrition and Metabolism Center.\n\nAbout UCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospital Oakland\n\nUCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospital Oakland (formerly Children\'s Hospital & Research Center Oakland) is a premier, not-for-profit medical center for children in Northern California, and is the only hospital in the East Bay 100% devoted to pediatrics. UCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospital Oakland affiliated with UCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospital San Francisco on January 1, 2014. UCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospital Oakland is a national leader in many pediatric specialties including cardiology, hematology/oncology, neonatology, neurosurgery, endocrinology, urology, orthopedics, and sports medicine. The hospital is one of only five ACS Pediatric Level I Trauma Centers in the state, and has one of largest pediatric intensive care units in Northern California. UCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospital Oakland is also a leading teaching hospital with an outstanding pediatric residency program and a number of unique pediatric subspecialty fellowship programs.']","This study might have important public health implications but the release will leave readers confused about its message. Are readers being encouraged to consume more zinc, and if so how? Through supplementation or zinc fortified foods? It’s not at all clear.","This news release describes a new study looking at the correlation between zinc intake and DNA damage and consequently makes a case for biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat. Although the release does an exemplary job explaining the role zinc plays in our bodies, it doesn’t quite explain how this brief, small trial of 18 healthy men demonstrates the impact of zinc on cellular health. It uses vague, broad language to describe the study’s findings and dedicates only one sentence to detail the study design.
Part news release, part policy article and part biofortification promotion, the release argues for the need for food-based interventions, like crop biofortification, to address malnutrition and mineral deficiency around the world based on a small study of 18 healthy American men. That may be due to the fact that the research was funded by HarvestPlus, a research program advocating for biofortification to breed higher levels of micronutrients directly into staple food crops. We wish this funding source was disclosed in the news release, as well as the question of how prevalent the practice of biofortification already is around the world.

These are early results, but if replicated may mean that treatment of some mental health problems could benefit from the inclusion of dietary advice. This is presented at the ECNP Conference in Barcelona.\n\nBipolar Disorder (which used to be called \'manic depression\') is characterised by episodes of mood swings, between being very up or very down with periods in between the two extremes. The fact that there are two opposite sets of symptoms means that finding an effective treatment is difficult. While current medications are useful, they are better at targeting mania symptoms (the \'up\' phase), leaving a lack of effective treatment for people experiencing depressive episodes. Now a group of Australian, German and American scientists have shown those who have a high quality diet, a less inflammatory diet, and/or a low BMI (Body Mass Index) may respond better to an add-on nutraceutical treatment provided as part of a clinical trial.\n\n""If we can confirm these results, then it\'s good news for people with Bipolar Disorder, as there is a great need for better treatments for the depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder"" said lead researcher Melanie Ashton of Deakin University in Australia.\n\nA total of 133 participants were randomly assigned to take a combination of nutraceuticals (compounds derived from foods such as vitamins or minerals that treat or prevent a disease or disorder) including the anti-inflammatory amino acid n-acetylcysteine (NAC), or NAC alone, or a placebo (a dummy pill) for 16 weeks. Participants received the study medication in addition to any stable treatments they were already receiving. Researchers measured BMI at the beginning of the study, and then measured depression and how a person is able to function in their day to day life. Researchers also rated whether a participant was improving and, if so, how much, over the next 20 weeks. Participants filled in a questionnaire about what they usually eat over the year and researchers calculated a diet quality score, where good diets included a healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, whereas poorer-quality diets had more saturated fat, refined carbohydrates and alcohol. These types of diets were then categorised as either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory based on foods that affect inflammation.\n\nMelanie Ashton continued, ""We found that people who had a better-quality diet, a diet with anti-inflammatory properties, or a lower BMI, showed better response to add-on nutraceutical treatment than did those who reported a low-quality diet, or a diet including foods that promote inflammation, or who were overweight.\n\nWhat this means, if these results can be repeated in a larger trial, is that treatment for Bipolar Disorder would need to take into account what a person eats and their weight.\n\nThere are some points we need to note about this study. This is a randomised, controlled trial, but what we found were exploratory outcomes; in other words, it wasn\'t the main result that we were testing. Our result is statistically significant, but because the study wasn\'t specifically designed to test the effect of diet quality,\n\ninflammatory diets and BMI on drug response in general, it is necessary to see the work replicated in a larger study before any firm conclusions can be formed"".\n\nCommenting, Professor Eduard Vieta (Barcelona) said:\n\n""This is interesting work, which holds out the possibility that patients with Bipolar Disorder may benefit from a balanced diet. However, it is an early study, and we need more research before we can think whether this might affect clinical practice"".\n\nProfessor Vieta was not involved in this work, it is an independent comment.\n\n###']",The release includes cautions and an outside perspective — something we’d like to see more of in health care PR announcements.,"There are several red flags for readers to be aware of in trying to understand this unpublished study (presented as a conference poster) looking into possible dietary influences on bipolar disorder. Mainly, this is a very small study, of limited duration, in which supportive data are not provided, and some key study design limitations are not discussed.
On a very positive note, the news release does a good job of making it clear the results need to be validated before dietary advice can be incorporated into the treatment of bipolar illness.

A study suggests online self-help behavior therapy could be a solution.\n\nSuicidal thoughts were much less common in new doctors who had four half-hour online sessions before starting their first year of training, compared with those who got no therapy.\n\nThe research involved about 200 medical interns — residents in their first post-graduate year, which is often one of the most intense periods of doctor training. It often involves 80-hour weeks and overnight hospital shifts dealing with multiple medical crises.\n\nAn earlier study of 740 interns found that suicidal thoughts increased almost four-fold during the first three months of residency, said Dr. Constance Guille of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. Her research group led both studies.\n\nSarah Dalechek, a first-year psychiatry resident at that university, said her program requires two month-long rotations of 16-hour overnight shifts in an emergency room. She said she became very depressed but had little time to seek help.\n\n""It\'s very stressful because you\'re sleep-deprived, you\'re not eating right ... you\'re working back-to-back shifts and you\'re trying to catch up on sleep but you can\'t,"" Dalechek said. She was not involved in the study.\n\nDalechek said she looked into seeing a therapist but would have preferred a web-based program since it\'s confidential and requires no appointment. Luckily, her depression subsided when that rotation ended.\n\nGuille said offering web-based therapy routinely to medical residents could be beneficial, if her research results are confirmed in a broader study.\n\nThe results were published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.\n\nThe study involved interns at Yale University and the University of Southern California. It used a free online program developed at the National Institute for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University in Canberra. Interns who got the sessions were 40 percent less likely to have suicidal thoughts during that first year compared to those who received four weekly emails with information about depressions and where to seek help.\n\nThe online program included sessions about how to put feelings of stress or despair into perspective. For example, a poor test grade or bad performance evaluation might lead to feelings of ""I\'m not good enough,"" but the lessons encourage more positive thinking about ""how many exams have you passed, to put this failure in a more accurate light,"" Guille said.\n\nThe training also encourages seeking out activities or thoughts that bring pleasure, especially when feeling down.\n\nPrevious research has shown benefits from similar web-based therapy in other settings.\n\nGuille said medical students and residents tend to be high-achieving perfectionists, but that they need to learn ""you can\'t always be perfect in medicine, you have to figure out how to deal with failure.""']",This story’s provision of some solid information wasn’t quite enough to satisfy our appetites. We wished for a few more details to round out the coverage.,"This is a somewhat uneven account of a study of the use of a web-based therapy program in the reduction of suicidal thoughts in medical interns. While some elements of the story are solid, it is incomplete in some important aspects.  The reader is provided with insufficient information on key components of the study design, in the timing of the collection of data presented, and on alternative approaches.  While the comments of Dr. Dalechek are useful for context, they do not replace the comments of an unaffiliated expert in the field.

Private investors and corporations are pouring money into the field.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSean Parker, the internet mogul of Napster fame, donated $24 million to set up an allergy research center at Stanford University. Nestlé this month invested $145 million in a startup aimed at tackling peanut allergy. And the Broad Institute of Cambridge, Mass., recently launched a new initiative to unravel the basic biology of food allergy.\n\nThe potential market is huge: It’s estimated that 50 million Americans have allergies. As many as 10 percent of children suffer from hay fever, nearly 12 percent have skin allergies, and 5 percent have food allergies, most commonly peanuts, dairy, and shellfish, according to the 2014 National Health Interview Survey.\n\n“I foresee that a lot of allergy therapies will become more and more specific and targeted, and more customizable to the individual patient,” said Andrew Long, the lead investigational drug pharmacist at Stanford’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy & Asthma Research.\n\nAnswering ‘home brews’ with science\n\n\n\nThe experimental treatment that may be closest to market is also one of the simplest. Bay Area startup Aimmune, backed in part by Nestlé with that $145 million investment, is creating a methodical peanut desensitization pill that slowly weans patients away from allergy.\n\nThe company has identified the peanut proteins that trigger allergic reaction and is filling little capsules with the stuff. Patients start out by taking half a milligram of peanut protein, and gradually work their way up — over the course of about six months — to the equivalent of eating a single peanut.\n\n“The people who need it the most are the people who have the most profound and potentially life-threatening reaction,” said Dr. Daniel Adelman, chief medical officer of Aimmune.\n\nThe capsules are science’s answer to previous efforts from allergists, who would concoct “home brews” of peanut protein to desensitize patients under the table. Aimmune’s peanut powder is in Phase 3 trials — and, despite its relative simplicity, is still considered something of a trailblazer in allergy science.\n\nTackling multiple allergies at once\n\nResearchers at Stanford University are building on the concept of desensitization.\n\nOne of the drugs Long is excited about: omalizumab, a biologic drug made by Genentech under the trade name Xolair.\n\nTo understand how it works, you have to back up and look at why you get all itchy and wheezy when you encounter an allergen. Such responses make sense from an evolutionary standpoint: They initially came into being to protect our bodies against toxins, like snake venom, or to ward away parasites. But they can be deadly in the modern era.\n\nTwo types of immune cells — called mast cells and basophils — are the biggest culprits behind allergic reactions. When a person encounters an allergen, let’s say peanut protein, a type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, gets activated. This stimulates the mast cells and basophils to release a storm of chemicals that provoke an allergic response to help exorcise peanut protein from the body.\n\nGenentech’s drug is an engineered antibody that binds to human IgE, blocking it from triggering that chemical storm.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in 2003 to treat a form of asthma often triggered by allergens, but Stanford researchers are now testing it on patients with food allergies — and finding that it might help speed along classic allergy desensitization therapy, in which patients are slowly introduced to escalating quantities of the allergen, via allergy shots or those “home brew” concoctions.\n\n“Right now, the process of immunotherapy is painstakingly long — it takes not just weeks or months, but years, to treat a single allergy this way,” said Dr. Toshi Kawakami, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology.\n\nThis timeline becomes untenable for patients with multiple allergies — and about 70 percent of people who have an allergy to one type of food will also be allergic to another, Long said.\n\nSo Stanford has paired Xolair with desensitization therapy to treat up to five different food allergens at any given time. Instead of taking years to gird a patient’s body against peanuts, they’re able to help her control her reactions to, say, hazelnuts, fish, dairy, and wheat as well.\n\nLooking at IgE from a different angle, Harvard statistical geneticist Liming Liang has been hunting for new drug targets that might modulate how, exactly, the antibody is expressed. In a paper published last year in Nature, Liang’s team found 30 genes that are involved in kicking off the allergic response.\n\n“We think we’ll be able to identify a potential drug target here for allergy reaction — but, of course, it’ll take quite a long time to turn that into a medicine used by patients,” Liang said.\n\nTesting a DNA vaccine for allergens\n\nAnother compelling approach is being taken by Japan’s Astellas Pharma (ALPMY), which is developing a DNA vaccine meant to protect the body from cedar pollen. (Hay fever has been called a “national affliction” in Japan, affecting a quarter of the population.)\n\nThe underlying research, from Immunomic Therapeutics and Johns Hopkins University, involves attaching a fragment of DNA from, say, cedar pollen to a template vaccine that can embed itself inside the cell. Once there, it revs up an aggressive immune response and imprints an “immunological memory,” which means the immune system will respond even more quickly to future exposures to the allergen.\n\nThe idea is to create resistance to an allergen without ever having to expose the patient to that substance. If it works, it’d be fairly easy to swap out the cedar pollen DNA for a different allergen — for instance, the genetic material that codes for peanut or cat antigens — and tack it onto this vaccine template.\n\n“The beauty of this is that, unlike food desensitization or skin patches, patients aren’t exposed to the circulating antigen,” Long said. “That hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.”\n\nOvercoming an industry’s fears\n\nFor all the research on allergies, none of the drugs in the pipeline is a sure thing.\n\nFor a cautionary tale, look no further than Circassia Pharmaceuticals, which has been working on an experimental immunotherapy drug to forestall cat allergies. Interest in Circassia had been sky-high — the small biotech’s market value had shot up to $1 billion earlier this year on speculation that its drug would prove effective.\n\nBut in a Phase 3 study, it turned out that the placebo effect was as effective as the drug itself. The company’s stock plummeted on that news this past June.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for The Readout Your daily guide to what’s happening in biotech. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nIt’s not just that solving allergies is hard. Current medications — such as Benadryl, Claritin, and epinephrine (best known for powering the EpiPen) — do a decent job controlling symptoms in most patients, so there’s little incentive to innovate.\n\n“There’s a dearth of new allergy products because antihistamines work so well,” said Dr. Todd Brady, CEO of Aldeyra Therapeutics (ALDX), a startup in Lexington, Mass., that’s developing a drug to reduce eye irritation from allergies.\n\n“They’re generic, they’re cheap, they’re safe, and easy to use — but unfortunately, a lot of patients suffer because of that phenomenon, because not everyone responds to antihistamines,” Brady said.\n\nAnother reason for the hesitancy: liability concerns. It’s a risky proposition to give patients the foods they’re deathly allergic to — inducing anaphylactic reactions simply to test drugs in clinical trials.\n\n“At the end of the day, it’s a fairly 19th-century approach,” said Dr. Wayne Shreffler, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who is working on the Broad Institute’s Food Allergy Science Initiative. “There’s really no doubt that there have been cold feet in the industry about this issue.”\n\nBut investigators around the world have shown they can carry out these “food challenge” trials safely — which could help hasten the development of new drugs.\n\n“In school, we didn’t learn anything about allergy treatment, except antihistamines and epinephrine,” Long said. “But now, we’re seeing this whole new spectrum of treatments. It’ll be interesting to see how this translates into making it into a pharmacy, and into the hands of patients.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of the story misstated some aspects of Aimunne’s work on peanut allergies.""]","Parents curious about these forthcoming treatments are likely already wondering if they’ll be affordable, but the story skirts any discussion of pricing.","The headline on this story from STAT promises to highlight a “new era” in allergy treatment built around the idea of preventing histamine and other immunologic explosions in our bodies’ mast cells and basophils before they start.
What it delivers is something less–updates on efforts at immunologic therapies that are way short of popping up at the pharmacy anytime soon–and more: an eye-opening look at how Big Pharma and Big Science are investing Big Money in a potentially huge worldwide market for treatments that probably won’t do much better than antihistamines, epinephrine and allergen-avoidance.

The company is seeking FDA approval to market the drug to certain men to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The drug will be reviewed by an FDA advisory panel on Wednesday along with Merck & Co.\'s Proscar, a drug similar to Avodart.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline conducted a study involving more than 8,000 men considered at high risk of developing prostate cancer. Overall, the study found a 23% reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer over a four-year period among those treated with Avodart, compared to patients receiving a placebo. The company has proposed that men considered at high risk for the development of prostate cancer are those who have had a prior negative biopsy and have an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen, or PSA.\n\nIn a document posted on the FDA\'s website Monday, the agency said the study results involving Avodart ""do not appear to confer clinical benefit for the indication under consideration.""\n\nThe agency said the reduction in prostate cancer risk was driven by prostate cancers considered to be low-risk. There was an increase in prostate cancers considered ""high-risk"" or those with a so-called Gleason Score of 8 to 10 among patients treated with Avodart compared to those receiving a placebo drug, the FDA said. Higher Gleason Scores indicate more aggressive cancers.\n\nSpecifically, 29 high-grade tumors were found among patients being treated with Avodart compared to 19 in the placebo group.\n\nAnne Phillips, a medicines development leader at GlaxoSmithKline, said the company believes Avodart can be safely used to lower the risk of prostate cancer ""without interfering with the ability to pick up the high-grade cancer."" She noted that men diagnosed with prostate cancer are often treated aggressively even in cases where their tumors are low-grade or low-risk.\n\nMerck is seeking to add the results of a separate clinical study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute that suggested Proscar cut the risk of prostate cancer, although the company isn\'t seeking FDA approval to market Proscar to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Proscar is widely available as a generic drug.\n\nThe FDA said the proposed label changes ""could be interpreted to suggest that Proscar is safe and effective for the prevention of prostate cancer in healthy men.""\n\nThe agency said there was an increased risk of high-grade cancers among men treated with Proscar and a decreased risk of lower-grade cancers compared to those treated with a placebo over a period of about seven years.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Corbett Dooren at jennifer.corbett-dooren@dowjones.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Harms, costs, and independent voices were lacking in this story. </span>","This story attempts to explain why the FDA seems hesitant to approve a drug named Avodart for the prevention of prostate cancer. (It also diverges briefly into the discussion of a second drug, Proscar, which isn’t the main focus of the story and won’t be addressed in our review.) The key point — which the story communicates well — is that the drug prevents low-risk cancers but seems to encourage the growth of aggressive ones. So the the data require close scrutiny to see whether there’s an actual net benefit to patients who are treated with the medication. Unfortunately, the story fell short in its coverage of some of the other areas that we feel readers deserve to see addressed. Detail about costs and harms is especially important in a case like this where a drug’s purported benefits appear to be marginal–and yet the story provided no information.

The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.\n\nPembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.\n\n""We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,"" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study\'s lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. ""So we thought, \'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?\'\n\n""It\'s like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.""\n\nThe researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.\n\nAll 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.\n\nThe other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.\n\n""For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy still only works in a subset of patients,"" said Dr. Deborah Wong, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Geffen School of Medicine and an oncologist at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, who was also an author of the paper.\n\n""This particular combination has been especially gratifying because not only does the SD-101 therapy drug induce tumor shrinkage at the actual site where it\'s injected, but it\'s working in conjunction with pembrolizumab to shrink tumors outside of the ones we\'re directly injecting.""\n\nThe study highlights the need for more research into combination therapies like this one, because many people with cancer do not respond to immunotherapy or experience a reoccurrence of their tumors after treatment.\n\n""We are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients,"" said Ribas, who is also the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. ""By understanding that, we can find more ways to make that therapy more active. One way is by combining the therapy with another agent that can overcome the resistance that some cancers have to these therapies.""\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded by Dynavax Technologies Corp., which provided SD-101. Merck & Co. provided pembrolizumab. Ribas\' research is funded by the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and the National Institutes of Health.']",It’s also notable that the Radiological Society of North America news release made no mention of side effects among patients given this combination of therapies–even though it was a phase 1 trial designed to assess safety.,"This news release describes a phase 1b trial to test whether injecting an immune stimulant directly into metastatic melanoma lesions would change the environment around the tumor in ways that would make an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), more effective.
But it’s important the readers are left primarily with the understanding that the results are from the dose-escalation phase–the part of a clinical trial where the researchers look to determine the “best” dose, typically meaning the highest dose that can be used without causing adverse symptoms or side effects.
The study was not designed to see whether this approach was better than the approach currently used, or if it helped some people with metastatic melanoma live longer.
Yet, the headline states: Combination approach shows promise for beating advanced melanoma.
The sub-headline asserts, “the new treatment is more effective in people receiving immunotherapy for the first time.”
And the first paragraph asserts that “a treatment that uses a bacteria-like agent in combination with an immunotherapy drug could help some people with advanced melanoma … live longer.”
None of that is known yet.
It also is notable that the release made no mention of side effects among patients given this combination of therapies–even though that’s what this trial was examining.

Campos, lead author of one of two papers appearing in the February issue of the Archives of Surgery.\n\nGastric bypass and lap-banding are the two most common surgical weight-loss procedures performed in the United States. The former involves stapling the stomach so food has to bypass a section of the small intestine, meaning you get full faster and less food gets absorbed into the gut.\n\nLap-banding, introduced in 2001, involves separating the stomach into two sections with a band so, simply speaking, eating too much becomes more difficult. ""It\'s a diet with a seatbelt,"" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of bariatric surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and Northern Westchester Hospital in Mt. Kisco, N.Y.\n\nIn a third type of weight-loss procedure, known as sleeve gastrectomy, surgeons remove part of the stomach.\n\nThe study led by Campos compared weight loss and diabetes outcomes in 100 patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery with 100 patients who underwent lap-banding. Gastric bypass is considered riskier and more technically demanding than the band.\n\nAll patients were morbidly obese (with a body-mass index higher than 40), and 34 in each group had type 2 diabetes.\n\nAlthough Campos is now an associate professor of surgery at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, he conducted the study while at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn the bypass group, patients lost an average of 64 percent of their excess weight, vs. 36 percent for those in the lap-banding group. Three-quarters of those undergoing gastric bypass surgery saw their diabetes improve or resolve, vs. only half in the other group.\n\nThe average cost of a bariatric surgery is nearly $30,000, according to a recent study from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLike all surgeries, weight-loss surgery carries its own set of possible risks, including bleeding, blood clots, infection and leaks from sites where body tissues are sewn or stapled together, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Later complications may include malnutrition, hernias and a tendency in about one in 10 people to regain much of the weight they lost as a result of the procedure.\n\nIn Campos\' study, roughly equal numbers of patients in each group experienced complications after one year (12 percent in the gastric bypass group compared to 15 percent in the lap-banding group); these included infection, internal bleeding and blood clots, but no deaths. More people in the bypass group had complications right after the surgery. More of those undergoing lap-banding, however, needed repeat surgeries (13 percent vs. 2 percent).\n\nThe second study, conducted in Taiwan and led by Dr. Wei-Jei Lee of the Min-Sheng General Hospital, involved randomly assigning 60 obese (but not morbidly obese) patients with type 2 diabetes to receive gastric bypass surgery or sleeve gastrectomy.\n\nAlmost all of those undergoing gastric bypass surgery (93 percent) had their diabetes resolved, vs. only half in the other group (these numbers declined to 57 percent and 0 percent after a year).\n\nThose in the gastric bypass group also lost more weight, and there were no serious complications in either group.\n\nThere are various theories to explain why gastric bypass may be superior, including one that attributes the success to changes in hormones that control the metabolism of blood sugar.\n\nAnd certain procedures may still be preferable for certain patient populations, added Roslin, such as bands for patients with lower BMI who don\'t have so many metabolic challenges.\n\n""Everyone thinks that all weight-loss operations are the same, even the doctors and the surgeons. [But] they\'re different, and they have different resolutions of comorbidities and probably should be used for different indications,"" he said.\n\nAn editorial accompanying the studies noted the results should be interpreted with caution since longer-term data is not yet available.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery for more on weight-loss procedures.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The headline &amp; lead paragraph overstate the strength of the evidence — a problem we also flagged in the <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3662"" target=""_blank"">competing LA Times coverage</a>. But this story quickly hedges with an important caveat that the Times missed.</span>","This story also was better than the LA Times story in other small but tangible ways, including its handling of the statistics on benefits and harms and its discussion of costs.

However, a similar approach might work for some other mutations.\n\nDuchenne, which affects as many as 15,000 Americans, mainly boys and young men, is the most severe common form of muscular dystrophy, a disease made more prominent by years of Jerry Lewis telethons. Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Patients typically lose the ability to walk as teenagers and die by age 30.\n\nWhile steroids, which reduce inflammation, can slow progression of the disease, they have undesirable side effects. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease.\n\nEteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. It changed its name recently from AVI BioPharma to distance itself from its underachieving past.\n\nPhoto\n\nShares of Sarepta nearly tripled on Wednesday, closing at $44.93. And the stock had already roughly quadrupled since July, when Sarepta announced some interim results from the study.\n\nThe study measured how far the boys could walk in six minutes. Those who received the higher dose walked an average of 21 meters farther after 48 weeks of treatment than at the beginning of the trial, a gain of about 5 percent. The boys in the placebo group walked 68 fewer meters at the end than at the beginning, a decline of about 17 percent.\n\nOne possible reason for skepticism is that two of the boys on a lower dose of the drug rapidly lost the ability to walk, even though the level of dystrophin in their muscles increased substantially.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“If you wait and require this company to do another two-year study, a lot of these boys are going to be in a wheelchair,” Christopher Garabedian, the Sarepta chief executive, said in an interview.\n\nPatient groups may also put some pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug quickly. But some also want Sarepta to make the drug available to more patients on a compassionate basis even before approval.\n\nTen-year-old Max Leclaire of Saxtons River, Vt., who has been receiving the highest dose in the trial, can now walk up stairs without having to pull himself up by the handrail, according to his mother, Jenn McNary. “He’s no longer riding the handicap bus to school,” she said.\n\nBut Ms. McNary said Sarepta had refused to provide the drug to Max’s 13-year-old brother, Austin, who could not be in the trial because he already could not walk.\n\nMr. Garabedian said Sarepta did not have the money or the manufacturing capacity to make the drug available outside of clinical trials. “That would be the quickest path to insolvency,” he said.\n\nIf eteplirsen gets to market, it would come nearly three decades after the 1986 discovery of the gene responsible for Duchenne. It would also represent a success, after decades of setbacks, for the technology eteplirsen uses, called antisense, which is a way of turning off specific genes.\n\nEteplirsen actually turns off just one part of the dystrophin gene, known as exon 51, which contains a mutation that in some patients stops production of dystrophin. By skipping over this exon, muscle cells can produce an imperfect form of dystrophin that nonetheless is at least partly functional.""]",A reasonably well written report on an early trial of a promising drug with just enough provisos to put the study into perspective.  We would have liked to have seen some additional information about potential harms (available in the company’s press release) and some thoughts from an independent expert.,"The approach to Duchenne muscular dystrophy described in the story is new and offers a potential approach to a host of genetic disorders.
Because the science is new and has not been studied in great detail, there are no guarantees that the approach will work in the long run and that side effects will not limit its usefulness.  This story did a reasonable job in describing a study based on information provided by the manufacturer and not yet published or even in abstract form.

The boy is currently on chemotherapy, the study authors noted.\n\n""This is a very good first step, but it\'s a little scary and we need to move to safer vectors,"" said Dr. Mary Ellen Conley, director of the Program in Genetic Immunodeficiencies at St. Jude Children\'s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.\n\n""The study shows proof-of-principle that gene therapy with stem cells in a genetic disorder like this has strong potential,"" added Paul Sanberg, a stem cell specialist who is director of the University of South Florida Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair in Tampa.\n\nNeither Conley nor Sanberg were involved in the study, which is scheduled to be presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Orlando, Fla.\n\nAccording to Conley, children (mostly boys) with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) are born with an inherited genetic defect on the X chromosome that affects the number and size of platelets and makes the children remarkably susceptible to easy bleeding and infections, including different types of cancer.\n\nBone marrow transplants are the main treatment for the disorder which, if they succeed, basically cure the patient.\n\n""They grow up, go to college and they cause problems,"" said Conley. ""But they\'re not an easy group of patients to transplant.""\n\nEven if a good match is found, transplant recipients can go on to have more problems with infections, such as graft-versus-host disease, in which the body basically rejects the foreign elements.\n\n""One of the long-lasting complications is the kids couldn\'t do this, they couldn\'t do that, they see themselves as different,"" Conley said. ""Transplants are getting better but we need better therapy, there\'s no question.""\n\nIn this study, the researchers inserted a healthy gene capable of producing WAS protein into hematopoietic stem cells (the ""granddaddy"" cells that give rise to different blood cells), then transferred these stem cells back into the patient using a viral vector. A viral vector is a virus that has been modified to deliver foreign genetic material into a cell.\n\nIn fact, the experiment was largely successful, with cells now able to produce WAS protein, resulting in increased platelet counts and improvement of some immune-system cells.\n\n""This is a first step that says you can correct the disease but I think most people would look at it and say the risk of leukemia is something, and that, let\'s see if we can avoid that,"" said Conley, whose team at St. Jude is working on a therapy involving a different type of vector. ""It\'s a good start, but I think we have better things coming down the road.""\n\nIn other news from the conference, another group of German researchers have determined that people who donate peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow to help save a life don\'t face any heightened risk of cancer.\n\nPreviously there had been some concern that drugs needed to get the stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream where they could be accessed might pose a risk of leukemia.\n\nThe study was based on questionnaires returned from more than 12,500 donors, which also showed the donors tended to be in good health and were willing to donate again.\n\nAnother study found that the drug rituximab (Rituxan), used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and forms of leukemia and lymphoma, could greatly reduce graft-versus-host disease in stem cell transplant recipients.\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Marrow Donor Program has more on Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.']","On a point-by-point basis, this story about a very early gene therapy experiment meets many of our criteria… and yet readers may be left a bit befuddled. The story doesn’t include any comments from the researchers, some of the quotes are confusing, and the results of the experiment aren’t clearly summarized.","This story relayed the findings of a very preliminary study on a new treatment for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome — a rare genetic disorder that leads to serious immune system deficiencies and problems with blood clotting. While the story did convey some caution about the early stage of this research and the potential for major side effects, it didn’t provide quite enough detail to satisfy many of our criteria.

The study, published Monday 11 September in the open access medical journal PLOS Medicine, showed that corn-soy porridge should be replaced with a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS), a fortified peanut butter. The results of the study can be used directly both in the treatment and prevention of acute malnutrition.\n\nGlobally, more than 50 million children are affected by acute malnutrition. Those with the most severe acute malnutrition have more than ten times increased mortality, and those surviving may have impaired development, compared to children without malnutrition. But this can be prevented if children are treated early, while they only have moderate acute malnutrition.\n\nLNS supports healthy growth\n\nChristian Fabiansen, MD PhD and a team from the Department of Nutrition, Sports and Exercise at the University of Copenhagen conducted the study in collaboration with a PhD-student from the Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé in rural Northern Burkina Faso, where there was a high prevalence of acute malnutrition. Dr Fabiansen previously worked in humanitarian medical projects with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), who also sponsored this work. The research was conducted in a malnutrition project run by the medical humanitarian organisation The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and its Burkinabe partners Keoogo and SOS Médecins.\n\nDuring the trial, 1609 small children with moderate acute malnutrition were given either LNS or corn-soy porridge for 12 weeks. The study found that children who received LNS experienced greater weight gain, and the large majority of the weight gain was healthy lean tissue.\n\nDr Fabiansen , the main author of the paper appearing in PLOS Medicine today, underscores the importance of the findings:\n\n""Previous studies of nutritional supplements have mainly looked at the effect on weight gain. It has been a concern that LNS, with its very high fat content, would result mainly in weight gain composed of fat. But by using a method based measurement of heavy water in the child\'s body we have found that LNS mainly increase lean mass, that is muscles and organs, which are important for immune function, survival and development.""\n\nNovel standard for research in malnutrition may save lives\n\nProfessor Henrik Friis, the senior author on the paper, points to the importance of the collaboration between university researchers and humanitarian organizations:\n\n""It has been a new way to conduct research, that we tested the effect of nutritional supplements used mainly by aid agencies, employing very advanced research methods in remote rural areas where humanitarian organization are working, and not at the university hospitals. The collaboration between researchers and humanitarian organizations means these findings can have immediate practical impact on field practice.""\n\nThe General Director of the Danish section of MSF Jesper H. Brix notes:\n\n""Acute malnutrition is still a major global health problem. So, I hope we can use the results to provide the best possible treatment for more vulnerable children. If we can treat children with moderate acute malnutrition with the scientifically proven most effective food aid product, and thereby prevent severe acute malnutrition, then many lives can be saved""\n\nDr Susan Shepherd, a paediatrician who heads ALIMA\'s Operational and Clinical Research, says:\n\n""ALIMA is very proud of its participation in this study. Vulnerable children, no matter where they live, deserve the best medical and nutritional treatments available. Studies like Treatfood generate the evidence we need to make the best decisions with our patients. ALIMA is committed to developing more research partnerships in its humanitarian projects, because this is how we will raise the quality of medical practice for all.""\n\nTreatfood: treating acute malnutrition\n\nUniversity of Copenhagen, Doctors Without Borders and ALIMA have collaborated on the project Treatfood, which aims to improve products for children with acute malnutrition. The study was primarily funded by Danida, MSF-Denmark and MSF-Norway, and USAID via the World Food Programme.\n\nThe main Treatfood results are presented in the paper: Effectiveness of food supplements in increasing fat-free tissue accretion in children with moderate acute malnutrition: A randomised 2 × 2 × 3 factorial trial in Burkina Faso, published in the open access medical journal PLOS Medicine. Earlier peer-reviewed articles from the study have appeared in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, BMC Nutrition, and Appetite.\n\nFacts about malnutrition\n\nMalnutrition in children can be chronic or acute. In acute malnutrition children are thin relative to their height, or wasted. Approximately 8% or 50 mio children globally are affected by acute malnutrition. Of these, 2/3 have moderate and 1/3 severe acute malnutrition. Acute malnutrition is more life-threatening than chronic. In chronic malnutrition the children are short relative to their age, or stunted. More than 30% of children in the world have chronic malnutrition.\n\nPrevious research has focused on treatment of severe acute malnutrition. WHO has called for research to identify the most optimal foods for treatment of children with moderate acute malnutrition.\n\n###\n\nContact\n\nPhd Christian Fabiansen\n\nDepartment of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen\n\nTelephone: +45 22440844\n\nMail: chfa@nexs.ku.dk\n\nProfessor Henrik Friis\n\nDepartment of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen\n\nTelephone: +45 26253968\n\nMail: hfr@nexs.ku.dk\n\nGeneral Director Jesper H.

Acute malnutrition affects over 50 million children across the world. It is characterized by bodily wasting following experience of a recent period of starvation.
According to the researchers, until now there has been concern that because LNS has a very high fat content any weight gain it produced would be composed primarily of fat. The distinction of this study is its demonstration that LNS not only resulted in more weight gain, but that weight gain was in muscles and organs (lean mass) rather than fat.

The researchers conducted this study to further clarify the association between metformin use and lung cancer risk.\n\nSakoda and colleagues conducted a retrospective cohort study of 47,351 diabetic patients (54 percent men), 40 years or older, who completed a health-related survey between 1994 and 1996. Information on their diabetes medications was collected from electronic pharmacy records. About 46 percent of them were ""ever-users"" of metformin, defined as those who filled two or more prescriptions within a six-month period.\n\nDuring 15 years of follow-up, 747 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer. Of them, 80 were nonsmokers, and 203 were current smokers.\n\nMetformin use was not associated with lower lung cancer risk overall; however, the risk was 43 percent lower among diabetic patients who had never smoked, and the risk appeared to decrease with longer use. Nonsmokers who used metformin for five years or longer had a 52 percent reduction in lung cancer risk, but this finding was not statistically significant.\n\nMetformin use for five or more years was associated with a 31 percent decrease in the risk for adenocarcinoma, the most common type of lung cancer diagnosed in nonsmokers, and an 82 percent increase in the risk for small-cell carcinoma, a type of lung cancer often diagnosed in smokers, but neither of these findings were statistically significant.\n\nIn an interview, Sakoda said, ""Metformin use was not associated with lung cancer risk when we looked at all patients with diabetes. However, our results suggest that risk might differ by smoking history, with metformin decreasing risk among nonsmokers and increasing risk among current smokers. Our results suggesting that the risk associated with metformin might differ by smoking history were unexpected. Additional large, well-conducted studies are needed to clarify whether metformin may be used to prevent lung or other cancers, particularly in specific subpopulations, such as nonsmokers.""\n\n###\n\nThis study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Sakoda declares no conflicts of interest. Assiamira Ferrara, Charles Quesenberry Jr., and Laurel Habel, coauthors on this study, have received research funding from Takeda to Kaiser Foundation Research Institute for a study of pioglitazone and cancer and from Sanofi through a subcontract from University of North Carolina to Kaiser Foundation Research Institute for a study of insulin glargine and cancer. Habel has received additional research funding from Genentech to Kaiser Foundation Research Institute for a study of HER2-positive breast cancer, including risk of cardiotoxicity following trastuzumab.\n\nFollow us: Cancer Research Catalyst http://blog. aacr. org ; Twitter @AACR; and Facebook http://www. facebook. com/ aacr. org\n\nFor AACR information, visit Fast Facts\n\nAbout the American Association for Cancer Research']",This news release overreaches in an attempt to find something newsworthy to say about a negative study. It puts promotion ahead of information.,"This release reports on an NIH-funded study to determine if the use of the drug metformin by diabetic patients may affect their risk of developing lung cancer. The overall answer is that it does not, but the release takes five paragraphs to say that. Instead, it focuses on a very small subset of patients who had never smoked and whose lung cancer risk appeared to be lower than never-smokers who didn’t take metformin. By trumpeting findings from that subgroup — and burying the main results of the study, which were negative — this release misrepresents the research findings and misleads its readers.
We’d suggest that the findings of this study probably did not warrant the spotlight provided by a news release. But if a news release is to be issued, it should lead with the results for the primary outcome and give second billing to provocative but preliminary findings from subgroups. While not as egregious as another example of subgroup “spin” that we recently reported on, this news release will certainly give readers the impression that there’s something special about metformin when it comes to preventing cancer in people with diabetes, when that hasn’t been established with any certainty.

1562,story_reviews_01037,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/4165/,2011-08-01 11:00:00,The Healthy Skeptic: DHA touted as ‘smart’ pill for kids,"['As a new school year approaches, many parents are hoping for a breakthrough for their children: Higher grades, better behavior and fewer talks with exasperated teachers.\n\nTutors, counseling, stern lectures and good old-fashioned wishful thinking are all possibilities. But some moms and dads also try to give their kids a nutritional edge in the classroom with the help of supplements.\n\nMany supplements promise to boost young brains with doses of docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid that’s naturally found in cell membranes throughout the body. DHA is particularly abundant in the nervous system, and it seems to help brain cells communicate with one another. Commonly found in prenatal vitamins and infant formulas, DHA is also showing up in products specifically aimed at grade-school children.\n\nBrainStrong, a product from Amerifit that’s widely advertised on TV, has a gummy formula for children ages 4 to 12. Each dose has 100 milligrams of DHA, along with a full day’s supply of vitamins A, C, E and B2. According to the instructions, children should chew one gummy each day. It’s sold at many drugstores and grocery stores, with a price tag of about $15 for a bottle of 30 gummies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrainStrong gets its DHA from Martek Biosciences Corp., which harvests the fatty acid from algae. Martek Biosciences makes a supplement of its own called life’sDHA Kids Softgel. The label says it’s “Great for Kids” and has a picture of two young people jumping for joy to drive home the message. Each softgel contains 100 milligrams of DHA without any other added nutrients. The label specifies that the product is intended for children older than 6. The instructions say to take one softgel every day with a meal. You can buy a bottle of 90 softgels online for about $30.\n\nThe claims\n\nThe TV ad for BrainStrong — in which the narrator speculates that a young girl wrapping herself in toilet paper may become a fashion designer and a boy playing with his pudding may become a food critic — says that DHA is a “nutrient essential for proper brain development.” The ad’s tagline is “BrainStrong: Nourish their potential.”\n\nThe BrainStrong website doesn’t make any specific claims that it will make kids any smarter, but it does say that “DHA is brain nutrition” and that “DHA ensures that the brain, retina, heart and other parts of the nervous system develop and function properly from infancy through adulthood.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe website for life’sDHA simply says that it’s a “supplement for brain, eye and heart health.” Cassie France-Kelly, a spokeswoman for Martek Biosciences, says DHA is as important for the brain as calcium is for the bones. “The bottom line is that kids need it, but they don’t get enough of it in their diets,” she says.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nUndoubtedly, DHA is an important nutrient for the brain and other organs of the body, says Usha Ramakrishnan, an associate professor of global health at Emory University in Atlanta who specializes in childhood nutrition. From time to time, she has purchased DHA-enhanced milk for her own child, who is now 9.\n\nRamakrishnan says that, although the evidence isn’t exactly air-tight, there is reason to believe that DHA supplements could help some children perform better in the classroom, especially if their minds have a tendency to wander. Children who get adequate DHA as infants and toddlers — a crucial period of brain development — seem to have more focus in later years, she explains, so it’s reasonable to suspect that supplements could help older kids too. “It’s not something that will make you smarter,” she says. “But it may help you pay attention and get more out of school.”\n\nStill, Ramakrishnan says, parents shouldn’t expect any dramatic improvements. “If it were a whopping effect, there would be a lot more studies,” she says.\n\nOne of the few clinical trials of DHA supplements in school-age children included nearly 800 kids from Australia and Indonesia. The 2007 study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that giving kids a supplement containing 88 mg of DHA every day for a year slightly improved verbal learning and memory scores but didn’t seem to affect overall intelligence or the ability to pay attention.\n\nA 2010 study of 450 children ages 8 to 10 found that taking a supplement containing 200 mg of DHA every day for 16 weeks had almost no measurable effect on thinking skills or academic performance. As reported in the journal Research in Developmental Disabilities, the children receiving the DHA actually had slightly worse reports from teachers than the children taking a placebo.\n\nEven with such uncertainty, DHA supplements may be worth a try for school-age kids, says John Colombo, a DHA researcher and director of the Schiefelbusch Institute for Lifespan Studies at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Colombo says his own children, now 13 and 16, have been taking 100 mg DHA supplements (Neuromins, which also uses DHA from Martek) for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s impossible to know if it made them better students, Colombo says. But it almost certainly didn’t hurt. “There’s no downside to it,” he says.\n\nCurious about a consumer health product?

In this piece about DHA supplements, though, we felt there wasn’t enough hard-hitting skepticism. The story did a great job explaining the supplements themselves and discussing the way they are marketed. It also provided good cost information. Most importantly, it presented strong evidence to counter the claims that DHA makes kids smarter. That evidence, however, was undercut by the only two people quoted in the story. Two medical doctors who give their own children DHA. These experts essentially say that kids should take the supplements even if the evidence supporting its benefit is weak. The article quotes one of these experts saying, “There’s no downside to it.” Glossing over potential risks and touting uNPRoven benefits are usually areas where the Healthy Skeptic finds fault. We fear this story will become yet another piece of marketing for an health supplement that has no documented health benefit.

Men with high-risk cancer need long-term hormone therapy.\n\nThe hormone therapy is known as androgen deprivation therapy. It\'s designed to reduce the levels of male hormones (androgens) in the body, since they can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells.\n\n""For patients with early, localized cancer of the prostate who were treated with radiation therapy, [by] adding short-term androgen deprivation therapy, we improved their cure rates and increased their chance of living 10 years from 57 percent to 62 percent,"" said lead researcher Dr. Christopher U. Jones, from Radiological Associates of Sacramento, Calif.\n\nBut when the researchers looked closely at those findings, they found that patients with low-risk prostate cancer did not need hormone therapy because the chance they would survive with radiation alone was already almost 99 percent, Jones said.\n\nAnd while short term hormonal therapy is ""not very toxic, there are [still] some toxicities,"" Jones noted. ""We don\'t want to treat any man unnecessarily with that type of treatment. We really want to make sure -- if we are going to recommend that treatment -- the person really needs it,"" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, hormone therapy plus radiation was most effective in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. ""We decreased the risk of dying from prostate cancer in those patients from 10 percent to 3 percent, at 10 years,"" Jones said.\n\nFor patients with high-risk prostate cancer, using hormone therapy for just a short while is not effective, he added. ""We know from other studies that short-term androgen deprivation therapy isn\'t enough. You need to give long-term androgen deprivation therapy in addition to radiation to have the best results,"" Jones said.\n\nThe report was published in the July 14 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFor the study, Jones\' team randomly assigned almost 2,000 men with prostate cancer to radiation therapy alone or in combination with four months of hormone therapy. The hormone therapy started two months before radiation.\n\nSide effects of male hormone therapy can include erectile dysfunction (impotence), loss of sex drive, hot flashes, growth of breast tissue, loss of muscle and bone mass, weight gain, nausea, liver problems, fatigue, memory problems and mood swings.\n\nIn October 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked manufacturers to add a warning that certain drugs used in hormone therapy (including the one used in the study) were linked to a small but increased risk of diabetes, heart attack, stroke and sudden death in men.\n\nIn this study, men treated with hormone therapy experienced a much higher percentage of liver damage; toxic effects of radiation treatment were similar in both groups.\n\nOver an average of over nine years of follow-up, 62 percent of the men who had combination therapy were alive, compared with 57 percent of the men who received radiation therapy alone, the researchers found.\n\nOverall, hormone therapy reduced the risk of dying from prostate cancer over 10 years from 8 percent to 4 percent, Jones said.\n\nHe noted that the radiation treatments in use today differ from those given in 1994 when the trial began.\n\n""We can give 15 to 20 percent higher doses of radiation now than we could then, and we can do it more safely and more accurately,"" he said. So, that brings into question how much, if any, hormone therapy is needed, he added.\n\nAn ongoing trial among patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer aims to answer that question, Jones said. ""We are going to find out if androgen deprivation therapy still applies to patients treated with modern techniques,"" he said.\n\n""This study, in conjunction with what we know about hormonal therapy, really nails home the conclusion that hormonal therapy should not be used in men with low-risk disease because the risks outweigh any conceivable benefit,"" commented Dr. Anthony D\'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston and author of an accompanying journal editorial.\n\nD\'Amico noted that new studies using up-to-date high-dose radiation also found that the addition of short-term hormone therapy improved outcomes at five years for men with intermediate risk prostate cancer, compared with radiation alone.\n\n""If you are in the low-risk category, stay away from hormone therapy. It does no good. [It] can hurt,"" D\'Amico said. ""If you have anything beyond low-risk [prostate cancer], the hormonal therapy helps,"" he said. ""It\'s just a matter of how long you need it for. It could be four months, six months or longer.""\n\nThese findings are good news for some men, since the effects of short term of hormone therapy are reversible, D\'Amico said. ""It\'s not three years, where men are changed forever,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on prostate cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was a generally well done story.  </span>","This story details the outcomes of a recent study examining whether the addition of male hormone therapy to radiation therapy improves outcomes for men with prostate cancer, and that the risk level of the man’s prostate cancer  determines whether short term male hormone therapy is of benefit.  The clear discussion of the study results should better enable readers to understand that not all prostate cancers are the same and that the approach to treatment should take into account the risk characteristic of the individual’s cancer.

Top of the list: the friendships and conversations in the locker room that are frequent sources of valuable information, connections and motivation. For example, I recently overheard a discussion about Y members and friends of members who had experienced devastating attacks of shingles, including one woman who nearly lost an eye and another who was left with unrelenting nerve pain.\n\nThat was the push I needed to end my procrastination about getting the new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last October after studies involving 16,600 people showed it to be far more effective at preventing this disease than the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, which I had had a decade earlier. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people 50 and older, including those previously immunized with Zostavax, should now get the Shingrix vaccine.\n\nThe process was surprisingly simple and less costly than I had anticipated (list price is $280 for the two-part shot without insurance). All I needed was a prescription from my doctor. I took it to my local pharmacy, where a staff pharmacist administered the vaccine. I’ll get the second part the same way in May. My Medicare Part D insurance covered it with a $40 co-pay for each part. (The cost may be higher if the vaccine is administered in a doctor’s office, so check first.)\n\nMany millions of Americans, especially those older than 40, are susceptible to an eventual attack of shingles, caused by the very same virus that causes chickenpox. Once this virus, varicella zoster, infects a person, it lies dormant for decades in nerve roots, ready to pounce when the immune system is weakened, say, by stress, medication, trauma or disease. One-third of Americans eventually get shingles, but the risk rises with age, and by age 85 half of adults will have had at least one outbreak of shingles.']",A study shows that the severity of the side effects of the vaccine were much more intense than what the Times implies.,"This New York Times story is a health column that’s unequivocally in favor of vaccination, and as such it presents information about the vaccine in a somewhat lopsided manner favoring the benefits of the vaccine and downplaying risk.
For example, relative numbers that inflate the benefits of the vaccine are used to describe effectiveness, but there is no quantification of the relatively common and significant adverse effects.

Made from parallel strands of the protein collagen, it refracts light to focus images on the retina.\n\nAlthough the fragile film is easily destroyed by trauma or infection, replacement human corneas can be used to restore vision, although this depends on a steady supply of donors.\n\nA team led by Griffith and Per Fagerholm, an ophthalmology professor and eye surgeon at Linkoping University in Sweden, conducted the study by removing diseased tissue from the corneas of 10 patients and replacing them with biosynthetic implants designed to mimic a normal human cornea.\n\nFor the process they used recombinant human collagen, a substance synthesized in the laboratory to mimic human tissue and supplied by the San Francisco biotech firm FibroGen Inc.\n\nThe patients were monitored for two years after surgery. The researchers found that, eventually, the cells and nerves from nine of the 10 patients regrew completely and packed themselves into the implant, resulting in a kind of “regenerated” cornea that looked and functioned like normal, healthy eye tissue.\n\nThe biosynthetic corneas also became sensitive to touch and the treated eyes began producing normal tears, the researchers said. Vision improved in six of the 10 patients.\n\nAfter the patients were also fitted with contact lenses, which is common after corneal transplants, their vision was comparable with that of patients who undergo regular human corneal tissue transplants.\n\n“The results were pretty encouraging and there is great potential here,” Fagerholm said in a telephone interview.\n\nLoss of vision due to corneal disease or trauma affects over 10 million people a year, but lack of access to donor tissue limits the number of transplants, particularly in poorer countries.\n\nIn the United States, an estimated 42,000 corneal grafts a year are performed using tissue from posthumous donors, but there are sometimes problems with rejection and experts say failure rates are significant.\n\nFagerholm said the patients in this trial had no problems with rejection and did not need long-term immune suppression drugs to help their bodies accept the corneas.']",This is the least complete of the three stories we reviewed that covered the publication of a small study of 10 patients who received synthetic cornea transplants. (See review of ,"Unlike the other two stories, this one takes too long to tell readers just how small the study really was. It does not bring in any outside experts to help put the research into context. Nor does it establish the novelty of the treatment, discuss the availability or even mention the potential costs.

The other eight were exposed to 60 minutes of continuous bright light. Those who experienced the flashing light were more quickly able to alter their circadian clock and thus, in theory, more quickly adapt to a new time zone.  The report covered the main bases found in the published research and, unlike a CNN article on the same study, included the helpful commentary of an outside observer who was able to add context to the meaning and impact of the study.

Survival was shown to be greatest among those prescribed first-generation nonselective beta-blockers. According to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators, the drugs block the effects of stress pathways involved in tumor growth and spread. With further research, they may also prove beneficial in conjunction with other treatment regimens and across other cancer types.\n\nPublished today in the journal CANCER, the findings are the result of a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of the medical records of 1,425 women with ovarian cancer treated between 2000 and 2010. Researchers compared overall survival among patients with documented beta-blocker use during chemotherapy and those without. Among the 269 patients who received beta-blockers, 193 (71.7 percent) received beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents (SBBs) and the remaining patients received nonselective beta antagonists (NSBBs). The research team found:\n\nFor patients receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers.\n\nMedian overall survival based on beta-blocker receptor selectivity was 94.9 months for those receiving NSBBs versus 38 months for those receiving SBBs.\n\nEven among patients with hypertension, a longer median overall survival was observed among users of NSBBs compared with nonusers (90 months versus 38.2 months).\n\nThis study builds on a large body of research by principal investigator Anil Sood, M.D., professor in Gynecologic Medical Oncology and Cancer Biology at MD Anderson. It showed that stress hormones fuel progression of ovarian and other cancers, and that beta-blockers - among the most proven drugs in cardiovascular medicine - might be a new way to stifle that effect.\n\n""Beta-blockers treat a variety of conditions, such as heart disease, high-blood pressure, glaucoma and migraines. They target a receptor protein in heart muscle that causes the heart to beat harder and faster when activated by stress hormones,"" Sood said. ""Our research has shown that the same stress mechanisms impact ovarian cancer progression, so these drugs could play a new role in cancer treatment.""\n\nAccording to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. ""The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis.""\n\nHe added that beta-blocker users in the study presented at a higher stage of disease, had an increased average BMI and were more likely to be hypertensive. All these factors were associated with decreased survival, yet those who received beta-blockers had either equivalent or improved overall survival. Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. This was not true for patients who took SBBs.\n\nAlthough further study is needed, these results highlight the importance of adrenergic receptor-β2 (ADRB2), a signaling pathway important to ovarian carcinogenesis and targeted by NSBBs (versus the ADRB1 pathway targeted by SBBs).\n\nOvarian cancer is the 5th most deadly cancer among women, accounting for more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer. An estimated 21,290 new cases are diagnosed, and some 14,180 women die from the disease each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nFuture trials will seek to identify patients who would benefit most from beta-blocker use and the best beta-blocker for a specific tumor type based on adrenergic receptor expression. Then they potentially could be used as an adjuvant therapy during surgical recovery and chemotherapy to decrease tumor growth, delays in wound healing and metastasis. Beta-blockers may also reduce cancer-related psychological distress in newly diagnosed patients, according to the study authors.\n\nThere are currently two clinical trials, one led by MD Anderson, evaluating the combination of chemotherapy and propranolol (a type of NSBB) on cancer biology and on stress modulators in patients with newly diagnosed EOC. According to Sood, the preliminary data from these feasibility trials will be used to design prospective, randomized clinical trials examining NSBBs on patient outcomes.\n\n""The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer. It also builds on the mounting evidence that beta-blockers may become a key treatment component for many patients in the future,"" said Sood.\n\n###\n\nPortions of this study were supported by National Institutes of Health grants (CA140933, CA104825, CA109298, P50CA083639, U54CA151688, U54CA96300, U54CA96297, and CA016672), an Ovarian Cancer Research Fund program Project Development Grant, the Department of Defense (grants OC073399, W81XWJ-10-0158, and OC100237), the Betty Ann Asche Murray Distinguished Professorship, the RGK Foundation, the Gilder Foundation, the Blanton-Davis Ovarian Cancer Research Program, and a Gynecologic Cancer Foundation-St. Louis Ovarian Cancer Awareness grant.

However, the study doesn’t seem to support the sweeping claim of the news release headline that the heart medication was “shown to prolong ovarian cancer patients’ survival.” There’s no mention of any of the limitations of the study design or the potential harms associated with the use of beta blockers.

(Nasdaq: HOLX) announced that study results published today in a research letter in JAMA conclude that breast tomosynthesis (Hologic\'s Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™) exams reduce recall rates, and increase invasive cancer detection in women with both dense and nondense breasts. These key benefits of 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ could lower the costs associated with needless follow-up exams, and improve patient experience for women seeking a more accurate screening mammogram.\n\nDensity is only identifiable on a mammogram or other imaging system, and is a reflection of how much fibrous or glandular tissue is in the breast. Higher breast density may increase a woman\'s chance of getting breast cancer, make detection of cancer on conventional mammography more difficult, and increase the chances that a woman will be recalled for additional imaging.1,2 Mammograms are categorized into four density groups: almost entirely fat, scattered fibroglandular densities, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense. The latter two groups are considered dense; however, the vast majority of women whose mammograms are considered dense have heterogeneously dense breast tissue.\n\n""Density creates challenges for conventional mammography by obscuring the images, which often results in additional visits and exams for women,"" said Edward Evantash, MD, board certified OB/GYN and Medical Director for Hologic. ""This new analysis confirms that Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams reduce unnecessary follow-up exams in dense-breasted women. This has the potential to provide health systems and insurance companies with significant cost savings, reduce patient stress and expenses, and alleviate challenges for referring physicians who are tasked with relaying mammography results to their patients.""\n\nImprovements in both recall rate reduction and invasive cancer detection were greatest for women with heterogeneously dense breasts, with a 50 percent increase in invasive cancer detection and a simultaneous 14 percent reduction in recall rate. Women with heterogeneously dense breasts make up about 40 percent of the U.S. screening population (women ages 40-74) — approximately 25 million women in the U.S.\n\n""Utilizing Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams for breast cancer screening will reduce the need for subsequent unnecessary testing, and decrease the number of unnecessary breast biopsies— addressing concerns that were previously raised as limitations of conventional mammography while also reducing costs for health systems,"" said Pete Valenti, Hologic\'s Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions. ""Twenty-six states have passed legislation requiring doctors to notify women if they have dense breasts — and now these women who were previously confused about how to proceed with breast cancer screening can feel confident turning to 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams to reduce their chances of stressful recalls and help find more invasive cancer.""\n\nThis study brought together the principal investigators from the groundbreaking 2014 study on 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams, also published in JAMA, this time led by Elizabeth Rafferty, MD, a co-author on the prior study.3 A total of 452,320 examinations (278,906 conventional mammograms compared to 173,414 Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams), were analyzed.\n\nGenius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams have been available in the U.S. since 2011, and are only available on the Hologic Selenia® Dimensions® mammography system.

A new wearable medical device developed by Kumamoto University has been found to effect visceral fat loss and improve blood glucose (sugar). The current study reports clinical trial results for optimal use frequency.\n\nType 2 diabetes is a disease of systemic organ failure due to chronic hyperglycemia and inflammation from the accumulation of excess visceral fat. Metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia attenuate stress resistance in the human body and exacerbate insulin resistance. The ability of insulin to lower blood sugar levels is reduced and insulin secretion is decreased.\n\nThe heat shock response (HSR) is activated as a response to stress in the human body, but its function decreased in those with type 2 diabetes. A research team from Kumamoto University, Japan has found that by restoring the function of HSP72, the main protein of HSR, improved glucose-related abnormalities. The team found that a suitable combination of mild electrical stimulation (MES) with heat shock (HS) activated HSP72 more efficiently.\n\nThe researchers developed a belt-type medical device that uses a special type of rubber to transmit MES and HS at the same time. They then performed a clinical trial of MES + HS on 40 obese men suffering from type 2 diabetes. Results showed a decrease fasting glucose levels, a loss of visceral fat, improve insulin resistance, and a significant (-0.43%) improvement in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. About half of all subjects (52.5%) achieved less than 7.0% HbA1c, which is a treatment goal for diabetes. The first trial showed that activation of the HSR produced a large therapeutic effect.\n\nIn the researcher\'s next clinical trial, 60 obese patients with type 2 diabetes from both genders were given a 12-week treatment with the belt-shaped MES+HS medical device. Trial subjects received treatments for 60 minutes each time, and were separated into three groups of 2, 4, and 7 treatments per week. This determined the most effective treatment frequency.\n\nThe reduction in the visceral fat area was 5.37 sq. cm in the 2 treatment per week group, 14.24 sq. cm in the 4 per week group and 16.45 sq. cm in the 7 per week group. Declines in HbA1c were 0.10%, 0.36%, and 0.65% in the 2, 4, and 7 treatment-per-week groups respectively. Improvements in chronic inflammation, fatty liver markers, renal function and lipid profile were also shown. Furthermore, adding the MES+HS treatment to a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is the most often used therapeutic drug for diabetes in Japan, showed an even stronger blood glucose improvement.\n\n""This device is very easy to use since it simply attaches to the abdomen, and it has a low-impact on the patient. One can expect the effects to be similar to exercise therapy,"" said Dr. Tatsuya Kondo, who lead the research. ""Even in patients who have difficulty exercising, such as those who are overweight, elderly, or have some form of disability, this device can be expected to provide acceptable treatment in addition to conventional diabetic medical care.""\n\nThis research was posted online in the nature.com journal Scientific Reports on October 19th, 2016.\n\n###\n\n[CITATION]\n\nT.

There were no complete responses with Yervoy alone.\n\n“The response rates and the depth of responses are quite impressive,” Dr. Stephen Hodi, director of the Melanoma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and co-lead author of the study, said in an interview.\n\nThe median time it took for Yervoy patients to see their cancer worsen was 4.4 months. But after 11 months, more than half of the combination group had yet to see their disease worsen. Overall survival data was not yet available.\n\n“Longer follow-up will be helpful to see the durability of these responses and what happens to patients who had complete responses,” said Hodi, who presented data from the Checkpoint-069 study at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nYervoy, also known as ipilimumab, had been the first immunotherapy to extend survival in patients with advanced melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer. It works by taking the brakes off the immune system to more efficiently attack cancer. Opdivo (nivolumab) belongs to a promising new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system.\n\nIn a separate group of 33 patients with a mutation of the BRAF gene involved in cancer cell growth, the overall response rate was 52 percent for the combination. The complete response rate was 22 percent. That compared with 1 percent overall response rate and no complete responses for Yervoy alone.\n\nThe combination of the two drugs also led to far higher levels of side effects, such as colitis and inflammation of lung tissue, at 54 percent versus 24 percent for Yervoy alone. Patients were also more likely to stop taking the combination of drugs.\n\n“Most of the patients who stopped for toxicity continued to benefit,” said Fouad Namouni, Bristol’s head of development for Yervoy and Opdivo.']",This bare-bones report on a drug trial was probably aimed at investors — but will almost certainly reach consumers as well. We think both groups would be interested in the very high cost of this drug combination.,"This story recaps a recent New England Journal of Medicine article that reports a combination of two immunotherapy drugs — ipilimumab (sold under the trade name Yervoy) and nivolumab (sold as Opdivo) — are more effective at treating advanced melanoma than Yervoy is by itself. It’s exciting and interesting news, but the story does little more than scratch the surface of this topic. It does not adequately address study design, cost or potential harms, and does not include any independent, third-party input.

All of the trials reviewed had ""major limitations,"" such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded).\n\n""The notion that any form of complementary and alternative medicine is effective for infantile colic currently is not supported from the evidence from the included randomized clinical trials,"" the researchers from the United Kingdom wrote. ""Additional replications are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.""\n\nBut because fennel extract, certain herbal teas and sugar water are generally safe, and because the research does suggest babies may benefit, pediatricians said they would feel comfortable recommending them to parents.\n\n""It\'s reasonable for parents to consider those kinds of interventions for which there is some suggestion of benefit but no known risks,"" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children\'s Medical Center of New York.\n\nThe study, published in the April print issue of Pediatrics, appears online March 28.\n\nColic usually starts when a baby is about three weeks old, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and author of the Expecting 411 book series. Colic is usually defined as excessive and inconsolable crying for at least three hours a day for more than three days a week over more than three weeks.\n\n""It\'s miserable for both baby and the parents,"" Brown said. ""And although we\'ve been studying it for years, no one has figured out what the cause is, which makes it all the more difficult to treat.""\n\nIn the United States, between 5 and 19 percent of infants are estimated to have colic, according to background information in the article.\n\nBecause pediatricians can\'t offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study.\n\nIn the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. The studies were published between 1991 and 2008, came from 10 different countries and included a total of 944 children.\n\nSeveral studies looked at spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. In three of those studies, parents reported their children cried significantly less afterwards. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review.\n\nThree studies looked at herbal supplements. One found improvement in infants given fennel extract compared to infants given a placebo; another found that infants given a tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel and balm-mint seemed to work; while a third found infants given a tea containing fennel, lemon balm and chamomile cried less than infants given a placebo.\n\nFennel, an intestinal ""antispasmodic,"" may increase the speed at which food moves through the intestine, Brown said. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added.\n\nTwo studies looked at giving babies solutions of sugar water, which some researchers believe has pain-killing properties. The parents of babies given sugar water reported significantly less crying. (If parents want to try it, they could deliver sugar water in a dropper, or put a small amount in a bottle, Adesman said.)\n\nA study of probiotics, which are reputed to help digestion, found that 95 percent of infants given L. reuteria probiotics seemed to reduce their average crying time compared to 7 percent of babies given simethicone, which is marketed to relieve gas under the brand names Mylicon and PediaCare Infants\' Gas Relief.\n\n""This is pertinent given that simethicone is considered the best available and most commonly prescribed treatment for colic, although it previously has been shown to be no more effective than the placebo,"" according to the authors.\n\nBrown said the strength of that finding suggests L. reuteria is worth further study.\n\nOne study found no difference in improvement of symptoms between infants whose parents were taught to do infant massage compared to infants put in a crib that vibrated. Nor did soy-enriched formula seem to help.\n\nA small study of babies given reflexology showed some improvement, but there was no difference in whether the reflexology targeted the feet, which are considered to be therapeutic for colic, or other parts of the body.\n\nThis implies the improvement may ""have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself,"" Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Nemours Foundation has more on colic.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">We found a stunning contrast between this story and another on the same study reported on the <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3767"" target=""_blank"">MSNBC site’s “Today Moms” feature</a>. We had to double check to make sure they were talking about the same study.</span>","HealthDay breaks down the evidence in a clear, concise way for readers, emphasizing high in the story that there still is not much evidence that any form of therapy works to quell colic. We wish it had spent a little more time quantifying the benefits that were found in this review for different alternative therapies, and we would have liked to have seen some cost information. All in all, though, this is exactly the approach more stories should take instead of presenting parents with an ever changing set of options for treating childhood maladies, none of which have much support in the scientific literature.

While their high blood pressure was not affected, cardiac health improved.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a major contributor to a form of heart failure that affects the way heart relaxes between contractions. About half of the human patients with heart failure suffer from this particular condition, known as diastolic heart failure. The majority of those patients are elderly women with high blood pressure. Importantly, there are currently no effective treatments for diastolic heart failure.\n\n""This low dose of thyroid hormone safely restored depressed cardiac tissue T3 levels to normal while largely preventing the accumulation of collagen, or scar tissue, resulting from sustained high blood pressure,"" said Gerdes. ""Thus, T3 treatment inhibited the major cause of stiffening of the heart in hypertension. The rats experienced overall improvement in contractile proteins and heart function too.""\n\nGerdes has published 32 animal studies showing a link between improvements in thyroid hormone levels and heart health in rats and mice.\n\n""The challenge now is to determine if humans benefit the same way,"" said Gerdes. ""If we can improve heart disease outcomes in patients by restoring normal thyroid function in the heart, we could save lives along with billions of dollars in health care expenses.""\n\nIn 2014, a study in Molecular Medicine showed that administering low doses of a thyroid hormone to rats with diabetes helped restore hormone levels in their hearts and prevented deterioration of heart function, adverse gene changes, and pathology. Earlier, a study in the Journal of Cardiac Failure found that thyroid hormone replacement therapy in rats significantly reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation. A 2013 study in The Journal of Translational Medicine showed thyroid hormone treatment administered to rats at the time of a heart attack led to a significant reduction in the loss of heart muscle cells and improvement in heart function.\n\nGerdes has long argued that medical opinion on thyroid treatment for patients with heart disease is largely shaped by outdated studies that used toxic doses of thyroid hormones.\n\n""What we have tried to do here is show the effect of safe doses of thyroid hormones and we\'re seeing amazing results in multiple studies, with dramatic improvements in heart function, gene expression, and collagen levels, just by restoring depressed thyroid levels in the heart,"" said Gerdes. ""The studies demonstrate that we should be able to implement a similar, safe treatment and monitoring program for use in human clinical trials. The experts once warned that Beta blockers were too dangerous to use in heart failure patients. But, they were proven to be wrong and these life-saving drugs are now standard therapy for heart failure treatment. I predict the same will eventually be true for thyroid hormones in a large subpopulation of cardiac patients. We are simply talking about restoring normal thyroid hormone balance in heart disease, not over-stimulating the heart.""\n\n###']",We wish more news releases were as up front with readers as this one is.,"This release focuses on a recently-published study in rats with high blood pressure that are at risk of heart failure, a condition in which the heart does not pump blood as efficiently as it should. The study’s findings suggest treating the animals with a low dose of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) improved cardiac health in the rats. Specifically, the study focused on diastolic heart failure, in which the left ventricle of the heart does not fill with blood properly, limiting the amount of blood pumped through the body with each heartbeat. The release mentions right in the headline that the study involved animals, and it does a good job of highlighting that much work needs to be done before the work done in rats may lead to clinical use in humans. The release could have done a better job describing the known risks associated with this hormone and describing the benefits observed in the study.

1607,story_reviews_00086,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/cnn-leaves-out-key-limitation-to-study-on-legalizing-marijuana-and-opioid-use/,2018-04-02 04:00:00,"Marijuana legalization could help offset opioid epidemic, studies find","['Watch Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta\'s CNN Special Report ""Weed 4: Pot vs. Pills"" on Sunday, April 29, at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n(CNN) Experts have proposed using medical marijuana to help Americans struggling with opioid addiction. Now, two studies suggest that there is merit to that strategy.\n\nThe studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , compared opioid prescription patterns in states that have enacted medical cannabis laws with those that have not. One of the studies looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D between 2010 and 2015, while the other looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid between 2011 and 2016.\n\nThe researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had 2.21 million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under Medicare Part D, compared with those states without medical cannabis laws. Opioid prescriptions under Medicaid also dropped by 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws, according to the studies.\n\n""This study adds one more brick in the wall in the argument that cannabis clearly has medical applications,"" said David Bradford , professor of public administration and policy at the University of Georgia and a lead author of the Medicare study.\n\n""And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective.""\n\nMedicare Part D, the optional prescription drug benefit plan for those enrolled in Medicare, covers more than 42 million Americans, including those 65 or older. Medicaid provides health coverage to more than 73 million low-income individuals in the US, according to the program\'s website\n\n""Medicare and Medicaid publishes this data, and we\'re free to use it, and anyone who\'s interested can download the data,"" Bradford said. ""But that means that we don\'t know what\'s going on with the privately insured and the uninsured population, and for that, I\'m afraid the data sets are proprietary and expensive.""\n\n\'This crisis is very real\'\n\nThe new research comes as the United States remains entangled in the worst opioid epidemic the world has ever seen. Opioid overdose has risen dramatically over the past 15 years and has been implicated in over 500,000 deaths since 2000 -- more than the number of Americans killed in World War II\n\n""As somebody who treats patients with opioid use disorders, this crisis is very real. These patients die every day, and it\'s quite shocking in many ways,"" said Dr. Kevin Hill , an addiction psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\n""We have had overuse of certain prescription opioids over the years, and it\'s certainly contributed to the opioid crisis that we\'re feeling,"" he added. ""I don\'t think that\'s the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids.""\n\nLike opioids, marijuana has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain as well as other conditions such as seizures, multiple sclerosis and certain mental disorders, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse . Research suggests that the cannabinoid and opioid receptor systems rely on common signaling pathways in the brain, including the dopamine reward system that is central to drug tolerance, dependence and addiction.\n\n""All drugs of abuse operate using some shared pathways. For example, cannabinoid receptors and opioid receptors coincidentally happen to be located very close by in many places in the brain,"" Hill said. ""So it stands to reason that a medication that affects one system might affect the other.""\n\nBut unlike opioids, marijuana has little addiction potential, and virtually no deaths from marijuana overdose have been reported in the United States, according to Bradford.\n\n""No one has ever died of cannabis, so it has many safety advantages over opiates,"" Bradford said. ""And to the extent that we\'re trying to manage the opiate crisis, cannabis is a potential tool.""\n\nComparing states with and without medical marijuana laws\n\nIn order to evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids, the two teams of researchers looked at whether opioid prescriptions were lower in states that had active medical cannabis laws and whether those states that enacted these laws during the study period saw reductions in opioid prescriptions.\n\nBoth teams, in fact, did find that opioid prescriptions were significantly lower in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws. The team that looked at Medicaid patients also found that the four states that switched from medical use only to recreational use -- Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington -- saw further reductions in opioid prescriptions, according to Hefei Wen , assistant professor of health management and policy at the University of Kentucky and a lead author on the Medicaid study.\n\n""We saw a 9% or 10% reduction (in opioid prescriptions) in Colorado and Oregon,"" Wen said. ""And in Alaska and Washington, the magnitude was a little bit smaller but still significant.""\n\nThe first state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medicinal use was California, in 1996. Since then, 29 states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of legalized cannabis. All of these states include chronic pain -- either directly or indirectly -- in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use, according to Bradford.\n\nThe details of the medical cannabis laws were found to have a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns, the researchers found. States that permitted recreational use, for example, saw an additional 6.38% reduction in opioid prescriptions under Medicaid compared with those states that permitted marijuana only for medical use, according to Wen.\n\nThe method of procurement also had a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns. States that permitted medical dispensaries -- regulated shops that people can visit to purchase cannabis products -- had 3.742 million fewer opioid prescriptions filled per year under Medicare Part D, while those that allowed only home cultivation had 1.792 million fewer opioid prescriptions per year.\n\n""We found that there was about a 14.5% reduction in any opiate use when dispensaries were turned on -- and that was statistically significant -- and about a 7% reduction in any opiate use when home cultivation only was turned on,"" Bradford said. ""So dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates.""\n\nThe impact of these laws also differed based on the class of opioid prescribed. Specifically, states with medical cannabis laws saw 20.7% fewer morphine prescriptions and 17.4% fewer hydrocodone prescriptions compared with states that did not have these laws, according to Bradford.\n\nFentanyl prescriptions under Medicare Part D also dropped by 8.5% in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws, though the difference was not statistically significant, Bradford said. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, like heroin, that can be prescribed legally by physicians. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and even a small amount can be fatal, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse\n\n""I know that many people, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, are skeptical of cannabis,"" Bradford said. ""But, you know, the attorney general needs to be terrified of fentanyl.""\n\n\'A call to action\'\n\nThis is not the first time researchers have found a link between marijuana legalization and decreased opioid use. A 2014 study showed that states with medical cannabis laws had 24.8% fewer opioid overdose deaths between 1999 and 2010. A study in 2017 also found that the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado in 2012 reversed the state\'s upward trend in opioid-related deaths.\n\n""There is a growing body of scientific literature suggesting that legal access to marijuana can reduce the use of opioids as well as opioid-related overdose deaths,"" said Melissa Moore , New York deputy state director for the Drug Policy Alliance. ""In states with medical marijuana laws, we have already seen decreased admissions for opioid-related treatment and dramatically reduced rates of opioid overdoses.""\n\nSome skeptics, though, argue that marijuana legalization could actually worsen the opioid epidemic. Another 2017 study , for example, showed a positive association between illicit cannabis use and opioid use disorders in the United States. But there may be an important difference between illicit cannabis use and legalized cannabis use, according to Hill.\n\n""As we have all of these states implementing these policies, it\'s imperative that we do more research,"" Hill said. ""We need to study the effects of these policies, and we really haven\'t done it to the degree that we should.""\n\nThe two recent studies looked only at patients enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare Part D, meaning the results may not be generalizable to the entire US population.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBut both Hill and Moore agree that as more states debate the merits of legalizing marijuana in the coming months and years, more research will be needed to create consistency between cannabis science and cannabis policy.\n\n""There is a great deal of movement in the Northeast, with New Hampshire and New Jersey being well-positioned to legalize adult use,"" Moore said. ""I believe there are also ballot measures to legalize marijuana in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota as well that voters will decide on in Fall 2018.""\n\nHill called the new research ""a call to action"" and added, ""we should be studying these policies. But unfortunately, the policies have far outpaced the science at this point.""']",There was no way to know if anyone was actually choosing to use marijuana instead of opioids.,"Health professionals—from doctors to policy experts—are exploring strategies for controlling the opioid crisis gripping the U.S. Advocates for legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational purposes have suggested that increased access to marijuana could curb opioid use. The two studies published in JAMA Internal Medicine discussed in this CNN article found that state legalization of medical marijuana was associated with a decrease in opioid prescriptions.
But before it presented the data, the article led readers to believe the study findings “suggest that there is merit” in “using medical marijuana to help Americans struggling with opioid addiction,”—which is beyond what the studies could possibly show.
The article took another misstep when it stated that the researchers analyzed opioid prescriptions to “evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids.” The data the researchers looked at could not answer that question. These were not clinical trials comparing pain relief from marijuana with pain relief from opioids in patients who would typically be prescribed opioids. They were analyses of data on opioid prescriptions in Medicaid and Medicare databases.
The researchers detail the limitations of their studies, as does a commentary published along with them. But only one limitation made it into the article: the caveat that the results may not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population because they only used data on patients enrolled in Medicare and Medicare Part D.
The biggest limitation goes unmentioned: There was no way to know if anyone was actually choosing to use marijuana instead of opioids.

Of those, between one third and one half have a type of lazy eye known as anisometropia, which is caused by a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes.\n\nStandard treatment for children involves eyeglasses or contact lens designed to correct focus issues. However, while this approach is often successful in younger children (between the ages of 3 and 7), it is successful among only about a third of older children (between the ages of 7 and 12).\n\nFor the latter group, doctors will often place a patch over the ""good"" eye temporarily in addition to eyeglasses, and treatment success is typically achieved in two-thirds of cases.\n\nChildren, however, often have trouble adhering to patch therapy, the treatment can bring emotional issues for some and a reverse form of lazy eye can also take root, the researchers said.\n\nStudy author Dr. Dennis S.C. Lam, from the department of ophthalmology and visual sciences and Institute of Chinese Medicine at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues report their observations in the December issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology.\n\nIn the search for a better option than patch therapy, Lam and his associates set out to explore the potential benefits of acupuncture, noting that it has been used to treat dry eye and myopia.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Lam and his colleagues recruited 88 children between the ages of 7 and 12 who had been diagnosed with anisometropia.\n\nAbout half the children were treated five times a week with acupuncture, targeting five specific acupuncture needle insertion points (located at the top of the head and the eyebrow region, as well as the legs and hands). The other half were given two hours a day of patch therapy, combined with a minimum of one hour per day of near-vision exercises such as reading.\n\nAfter about four months of treatment, the research team found that overall visual acuity improved markedly more among the acupuncture group relative to the patch group. In fact, they noted that while lazy eye was successfully treated in nearly 42 percent of the acupuncture patients, that figure dropped to less than 17 percent among the patch patients.\n\nNeither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said.\n\nThe team nonetheless pointed out that their study\'s tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist.\n\nAnd while theorizing that the apparent success of this alternative approach may have something to do with stimulating blood flow, retinal nerve growth and visual cortex activity, the authors acknowledged that the exact mechanism by which it works remains poorly understood.\n\nDr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that the finding is ""certainly suggestive and worth following up.""\n\n""This is kind of cool,"" he said. ""But I will say that I don\'t know of any study looking at acupuncture and vision. There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there\'s pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I\'ve heard of it, and I don\'t know that anyone has ever tried this before. So this is like a teaser.""\n\n""Of course people in those parts of the country, like where I live, where there\'s fairly wide acceptance of alternative medicine might receive this type of treatment better than others,"" Bensinger cautioned. ""And no question patients will gravitate towards treatments that are covered by their insurance even if it\'s not the best treatment. And as an alternative approach, this may not be covered.""\n\n""But if it works,"" he added, ""people will certainly be excited -- although it certainly needs further testing and further studies to decide if it\'s really beneficial or not.""\n\nFor his part, Dr. Stanley Chang, chairman of the ophthalmology department at Columbia University in New York City, did not seem to hold out much promise for acupuncture\'s potential as an alternative lazy eye therapy.\n\n""Acupuncture I think definitely works for pain amelioration, but I\'m not sure it works for some of these other things,"" he cautioned. ""They\'ve tried it for the treatment of myopia and glaucoma, without much success. And so although there haven\'t been any really good trials comparing acupuncture with conventional therapies, my guess is that it\'s probably not going to do much for the treatment of lazy eye.""\n\n""However, I think it\'s worth considering or trying,"" Chang added, ""because nothing else seems to work very well for patients of that age, including patch therapy. But what will need is a very carefully controlled study that accounts for all the variables that might have an impact on the outcome of this approach.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on amblyopia, visit the National Eye Institute.']","This story earned the same number of stars as the other one we reviewed on the results of this acupuncture trial, but the failure to quantify just how much difference was seen in patients leaves readers wondering.","This story offered an informative but flawed summary of a study that tested acupuncture to treat a form of “lazy eye” known as anisometropic amblyopia. It was at its best when describing why the trial, despite its positive results, provides only preliminary evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for this condition. On the downside, it offered only a vague description of how the researchers assessed the treatment effects in this study, making the discussion of benefits much less meaningful than that provided in the competing coverage from WebMD. The story also failed to completely characterize the costs and availability of acupuncture, and didn’t explain that the research team might have a financial incentive to promote the effectiveness of acupuncture.

It dilates blood vessels, giving it the potential to ease an abrupt cold water-induced constriction of blood vessels in the arms and legs that can lead to blood pooling in the heart and lungs.\n\nAthletes and others with this condition -- called swimming-induced pulmonary edema, or SIPE -- cough up blood, labor to breathe and have low blood-oxygen typically brought on by swimming or scuba diving, usually in cold water. Often the symptoms dissipate over 24 hours, but the condition can be serious and even fatal and medical attention is recommended. Many don\'t know they are prone to the problem until they are in the water and quickly develop symptoms.\n\n""During immersion in water, particularly cold water, susceptible people have an exaggerated degree of the normal redistribution of blood from the extremities to the chest area, causing increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs and leakage of fluid into the lungs,"" said Richard Moon, M.D., an anesthesiologist and medical director of the Duke Center for Hyperbaric Medicine & Environmental Physiology.\n\n""Some cases of SIPE appear to have been the result of cardiac problems,"" said Moon, who was lead author of the study published online February 16 in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nMoon and colleagues studied these responses in 10 athletes who had experienced the condition while exercising or competing in triathlons. During a carefully monitored test in Duke\'s hyperbaric center, the researchers had the participants exercise under water in a dive pool that recreated the conditions of a swim that could trigger the SIPE response.\n\nThey compared those participants with 20 others who did not have a history of SIPE. None of the participants in either group had heart abnormalities, but the SIPE-susceptible athletes had higher pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure during the underwater exercise, confirming that SIPE is a form of pulmonary edema caused by high pressure in the blood vessels within the lungs.\n\nWhen the SIPE participants were given sildenafil and then performed the same underwater exercise, the pressures were no longer as elevated.\n\n""This is a small study, but also very intensive with direct, accurate pressure measurements,"" Moon said. ""It appears that the drug, which dilates the blood vessels, could be creating more capacity in the blood vessels in the arms and legs, reducing the tendency for blood to redistribute to the thorax, and therefore reducing the high pressure in the pulmonary vessels.""\n\nOne study participant, triathlete Katherine Calder-Becker, said her bouts with SIPE threatened to end her competitive career. She said she would have no problems during training in swimming pools, but then experienced debilitating shortness of breath and distress during the swim portions of competitions in colder open water. She coughed up blood and was once hospitalized.\n\nTriathlete Calder-Becker, 51, was diagnosed with SIPE and enrolled in studies at Duke in 2011. Afterward, she consulted her cardiologist and was prescribed a low dose of sildenafil that she takes shortly before competitions.\n\n""I have successfully raced in 20 triathlons since I started taking sildenafil, including five ultra events that require 10-kilometer swims,"" Calder-Becker said. ""I have not had an incident since then. I didn\'t want to give up racing -- this is something my husband and I do together, and we travel together to competitions -- so it has meant everything to me to continue.""\n\nMoon said larger studies are needed to replicate the results and learn more about possible adverse side effects of the drug. He also said research is ongoing to further illuminate the causes of SIPE and potential ways of diagnosing it early.\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Moon, study authors include Stefanie D. Martina, Dionne F. Peacher, Jennifer F. Potter, Tracy E. Wester, Anne D. Cherry, Michael J. Natoli, Claire E. Otteni, Dawn N. Kernagis, William D. White, and John J. Freiberger.\n\nThis study received funding from the Divers Alert Network and U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command Contracts (N61331-03-C-0015, N0463A-07-C-0002).']",This news release uses a patient story to tout the benefits of Viagra for a rare lung condition affecting swimmers. The study itself was far less definitive than the patient’s glowing anecdote.,"This news release describes a small study of individuals prone to swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE, fluid in the lung) that found that giving them a dose of sildenafil (sold under the brand name Viagra) dilated blood vessels and prevented the cold water-induced constriction that may cause the problem. The study involved 10 individuals with a history of SIPE and 20 control subjects.
The news release, based on the study published in the journal Circulation, describes the condition and the study parameters nicely but then overwhelms the cautionary comments appropriate for such a modest design with an enthusiastic testimonial from a participant who felt the medicine was a life-changer. The release would be stronger if it had added some quantification of the benefits and relied less on a patient testimonial to make its case.

Thanks to that recommendation, which has influenced insurance company policies, annual pap tests are no longer the standard of care today— and I see that as a huge problem.\n\nFor one, the three- to five-year interval between screening tests for women ages 21 to 65 doesn’t take into account the several risk factors that boost a woman’s chance of developing cervical cancer, such as multiple sexual partners, a weakened immune system that occurs with smoking, and even oral contraceptive use for more than five years. For these women, there is a still a serious need for more frequent cervical cancer screening, but nowhere in the guidelines are these risk factors addressed. Unfortunately, the only risk factor that changes the recommended frequency of screening is an abnormal pap result in the past.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\nI watched a 28-year-old woman die of cervical cancer during my OB-GYN residency, and it was horrible. I don’t see why major medical organizations have made a recommendation that puts women at risk of a cancer that can be so easily prevented— and frankly, I see it as more of an economic decision than anything else.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at what this means: Let’s say you have multiple sexual partners and during a visit to your gynecologist, this information flies under the radar for whatever reason. (A woman with multiple sexual partners has a greater chance of acquiring HPV, the virus that causes most cervical cancers.) By the same token, no one brings up the issue of your partner’s number of partners. And by the way, you can never be 100 percent positive that your partner is monogamous— no one can! The greater the number of partners he has, the greater his risk of contracting HPV and passing it to you. So you aren’t given cervical cancer screening that day when, in fact, many doctors would agree that you need it.\n\nAnother problem I have with the current guidelines is this: New recommendations published last summer in the Annals of Internal Medicine advised physicians to stop offering routine pelvic exams to asymptomatic, average-risk women. I find this outrageous. Pelvic exams allow your physician to inspect the vulva for changes, and even feel around the ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes for any masses. The delay to diagnosis of vulvar cancer, specifically, is about 18 months. A gynecologist is trained to detect early changes, and then do a biopsy for anything suspicious. As a diagnostic and screening tool, the pelvic exam is vital.\n\nWhat makes all of this even worse: No more pelvic exams and infrequent paps mean women won’t see their gynecologist as regularly, and they may miss opportunities to voice concerns related to their reproductive health. An annual well-woman visit with your gynecologist allows you to discuss your health status, sexual practices, contraception needs, and get a breast exam, among other things— so it’s still important for you to go, even if you don’t end up having a pap or pelvic exam.\n\nUltimately, when it comes to gynecological cancer screening tests, every woman has individual risk factors, so you should talk to your doctor about yours. If you fall into any of the high risk categories— you have multiple partners, you smoke or are otherwise immunocompromised, and you’ve been on birth control pills for five years or more— you really should be screened at least every other year. If you’re insurance denies to cover this, you should fight them on the basis of being at a higher risk.\n\nAnd always be sure to visit your gyno if you’re having any sort of symptom, such as pelvic pain, irregular discharge, or sexual dysfunction— all of which can point to a more serious problem. In these cases, you should be given a pelvic exam at the very least.\n\nDr. Jennifer Landa is Chief Medical Officer of BodyLogicMD, the nation\'s largest franchise of physicians specializing in bioidentical hormone therapy.

Aside from the issue of balance, there are many factual errors in the science in this piece, particularly in the section on Pap smears.  Of our 3 reviewers on this piece, the physician-reviewer, with expertise in women’s health, said she discounted the credibility of the article because of the medical misinformation and lack of balance in that first section on cervical cancer screening. That’s too bad, because the topic raised in the second part, on the value of pelvic exams, is a worthwhile area for debate.  It is part of a larger discussion on the value of periodic visits — “annual exams” — that allow a doctor and patient to develop the shared medical history and level of trust that some say is a crucial part of excellent and effective health care, even if it is a difficult area to measure.

The program runs on a smartphone, which records the sessions.\n\nWhen the device\'s camera detects an emotion such as happiness or sadness, Julian sees the word ""happy"" or ""sad"" — or a corresponding ""emoji"" — flash on the glass display. The device also tests his ability to read facial expressions.\n\n""The autism glass program is meant to teach children with autism how to understand what a face is telling them. And we believe that when that happens they will become more socially engaged,"" said Dennis Wall, who directs the Stanford School of Medicine\'s Wall Lab, which is running the study.\n\nStanford student Catalin Voss and researcher Nick Haber developed the technology to track faces and detect emotions in a wide range of people and settings.\n\n""We had the idea of basically creating a behavioral aide that would recognize the expressions and faces for you and then give you social cues according to those,"" said Voss, who was partly inspired by a cousin who has autism.\n\nGoogle provided about 35 Google Glass devices to Stanford, but otherwise hasn\'t been involved in the project. The Silicon Valley tech giant stopped producing the headset last year after it failed to gain traction, but the device found new life among medical researchers.\n\nBrain Power, a Cambridge, Mass.-based startup, is also developing Google Glass-based applications to help children with autism improve their face-reading abilities and social skills.\n\nAutism advocates are excited that researchers are developing technologies to help the estimated one in 68 American children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.\n\n""Glass and wearable technology are the future.

While the story admits that these are very early results, the fact they are framed in such positive terms is a bit disconcerting and might be setting up false hope for families with children on the autism spectrum.
Even though autism advocates are “excited that researchers are developing technologies to help” these children, it might be worth waiting until there are more details of the effectiveness of the wearable technology before announcing it with such enthusiasm to the general public.

As most people age, an opaque film slowly forms over the lens -- the part of the eye that helps with focusing on images at various distances. It clouds vision and can lead to blindness.\n\nIn cataract surgery, which has been around for several decades, eye surgeons make an incision in the front of the eye and remove the lens from its supporting capsule. Then they replace it with an artificial lens.\n\nThe new procedure described in Nature involves making a slim incision at the side of the lens capsule, removing the entire lens, yet preserving the empty capsule bag or ""scaffold."" A certain kind of stem cell, called endogenous stem/progenitor cells, when left intact, then begins to repopulate the damaged lens and essentially grow a new, healthy lens.\n\nStudy author Dr. Kang Zhang, the chief of ophthalmic genetics at UC San Diego\'s Shiley Eye Institute, told CBS News, ""Unlike [the] current way of cataract surgery, which destroys over half of lens stem cells and requires implantation of a plastic intranet ocular lens, we devised a new surgery to make a very small opening at the side of a cataractous lens bag, remove [the] cataract inside, allow the opening to heal, and promote dormant lens stem cells to regrow an entirely new lens with vision.""\n\nPioneering surgery tested in babies\n\nThe experimental procedure was done in 12 infants who were born with a congenital cataract condition.\n\nBy using a less invasive procedure, Zhang and his colleagues report that they were able to leave the lens epithelial stem cells, also called LECs, intact. These LECs regenerated the eye\'s lens in the children, eliminating the need for implants. The same technique was also successfully performed in animals.\n\nIn little ones with congenital cataracts, eye surgeons need to intervene early so that light can get to the brain and allow for normal, healthy growth, said Suraj Bhat, associate professor of ophthalmology and director of the Vision Molecular Biology Laboratory at the UCLA Stein Eye Institute. Bhat was not involved in the new research, but said it\'s ""extremely exciting"" because it offers an alternative to ""an extraordinarily invasive"" procedure.\n\n""In early childhood cataracts are very bad. We need light to enter into the eyes at a young age to get proper brain function, otherwise, information does not get transferred to the developing brain,"" said Bhat.\n\nArtificial irises let people see in a different light\n\nTraditional surgery can cause opacity in the line of a child\'s vision and, because the eye is still growing, it is difficult to provide good vision with eye glasses, explained Julie T. Daniels, from University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, in an accompanying commentary in Nature.\n\nMany children also later go on to suffer from glaucoma.\n\nDaniels wrote that to correctly refract light onto the retina at the back of the eye, the cornea and lens must remain transparent throughout life. Current treatments for the cornea and lens involve donor transplants or artificial implants, but the procedures can be risky. She said the new procedure, which coaxes stem cells to regenerate normal tissue in the body, offers promise.\n\n""The study\'s stem cell engineering has led to the regeneration of transparent lens tissue in children, showing that the concept offers a potential therapeutic approach,"" Daniels wrote.\n\nShe noted a second study in Nature that used transplant tissue grown in the laboratory from stem cells to treat damaged corneas, saying it also holds promise.\n\nZhang said their results need to be validated in a large number of patients ""and with a longer follow-up period.""\n\nWill it work in older eyes?\n\nOne major question remains to be answered: Can it be applied to age-related cataracts, the leading cause of blindness?\n\nAccording to the National Eye Institute, about 24.4 million Americans suffer from cataracts. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of cataract cases in the U.S. went up by 20 percent, and it\'s expected to continue to grow as the population ages.\n\n""We are now planning a study to test this approach in this old patient population. In addition, we are testing if this approach can be used in treating other leading causes of blindness, such as macular degeneration and glaucoma,"" said Zhang.\n\nHe hopes the surgery will be available to the general population within four to five years.\n\n""I would anticipate that it may be available after several independent studies with a large number of patients,"" he said.\n\nSome other experts in the field saw great promise in the research.\n\n""Everyone\'s working on this. Stem cells are like the Holy Grail of vision research,"" Dr. James Tsai, M.D., president of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, told CBS News. ""To me, it\'s very exciting data. They may be on to something.""\n\nBut he tempered the hope the study offers by noting that the lens regeneration work is also ""very controversial"" and could impact a multimillion-dollar industry.\n\n""This is potentially a new surgery. If you think about the implications in the long run, lens implants may not be necessary,"" he said. ""There are a lot of doctors who will want to see more data.""\n\nHe also pointed out that the study involved infants, and that adults -- the most common cataract patients -- have a different regenerative capacity of lens epithelial stem cells.\n\nIn the meantime, Tsai said it\'s hopeful news for some babies with congenital cataracts like the children who participated in the study. ""As a glaucoma specialist, the way we do congenital cataracts, there\'s a great risk these babies will develop glaucoma for a lifetime and maybe with this new surgery, they won\'t have that glaucoma risk.""\n\nDr. Maria Valeria Canto-Soler, assistant professor of ophthalmology and director of the Retinal Degeneration Research Center at Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, said she was impressed by the research.\n\n""The main excitement for me is the ability to regenerate an organ or a tissue within an organ,"" said Canto-Soler, a retina specialist.\n\n""From what I know, I\'d say this is the first demonstration where you can use endogenous stem cells for replacing tissue within the eye. It\'s something we are all looking for. They have actually done it in humans.""\n\nShe said, even without answers to the question of whether it will work in aging eyes, it creates hope for children with congenital issues. ""If you can create it in children, that\'s a big thing. You are giving sight back to little kids and that change their lives.""\n\nLarger studies, ""more eyes"" needed\n\nDr. Kathryn Hatch, an ophthalmologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston, told CBS News the procedure ""seems very exciting,"" but more research is needed.\n\n""I\'d need to see a larger study with more eyes, and we need to see some reproducibility, and see how long it would take for the lens -- if it\'s able to regenerate -- what are the visual results. Because that\'s what patients really care about. Their vision. If it takes months to get to an outcome, it\'s not superior to the lens technologies we have now. I\'m not sure what the advantage is. Most patients don\'t even want to wait. They want to get back to work, their life,"" Hatch added.\n\nShe also had questions about how the procedure was done with such a tiny incision. ""I don\'t understand how they\'re doing the surgery with such a tiny hole without tearing the capsule. If we make a three millimeter incision [in traditional cataract surgery], that\'s really small in an adult.""\n\nCataract surgery is ""traditionally done by hand with a bent needle. That\'s one of the most difficult steps to learn as a surgeon. One of most important steps to learn,"" she said and there could be major eye damage if a surgery was compromised by a tear.\n\nShe also noted that baby eye surgery is different from adults in that the infant cataract is much softer compared to an adult\'s harder cataract.\n\nUCLA\'s Bhat noted another limitation in the study: ""These are all genetic cataracts. This study wasn\'t long enough. They [cataracts] may come back,"" he said, but it\'s also possible the genetic defect may not reappear.\n\nHe\'s said it\'s unclear if the results will be mirrored in older cataract patients, the same concern expressed by others in the field.\n\n""Cell division is slower in older people,"" Bhat said. ""The biggest problem as we grow older, particularly beyond 50, is cell division which keeps on decreasing. Our ability to make new cells is significantly lost. The process that these people are depending upon is tremendously dependent on cell division.""\n\nBhat said he also paused when he read the statement in the paper that claimed a 100 percent success rate three months after surgery.\n\n""I don\'t know them. I can\'t second guess them. You\'ve got to believe the written word.""']","This story had a lot going for it–including a multitude of independent sources–but it would have been stronger if it had better quantified the results of the study, and explained how the researchers measured the success of this new surgical method.","This story describes the findings of a study published in Nature that involved a new approach to correcting congenital cataracts in infants using the patient’s own stem cells to grow new lenses in the eye, versus the more standard approach of using artificial lenses.he story had a lot going for it compared with some less thorough competing stories (see here and here), especially when discussing important caveats about the study’s limitations. However, the piece would have been stronger if it had better quantified the results of the study: How did the researchers measure the success of this approach? We also wanted to see more information about the study design itself: How many patients were studied? And for how long? Finally, the story quickly turned to examining whether this approach might be used among older adults who have conventional cataracts–even though congenital cataracts are a very different disease process, and the current study applied to infants only.

Men also had a risk reduction from frequently eating berries.\n\n""For total flavonoids, the beneficial result was only in men. But, berries are protective in both men and women,"" said the study\'s lead author, Dr. Xiang Gao, a research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health and an associate epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston.\n\n""Berries could be a neuroprotective agent. People can include berries in their regular diet. There are no harmful effects from berry consumption, and they lower the risk of hypertension too,"" Gao added.\n\nResults of the study are published online April 4 in the journal Neurology.\n\nParkinson\'s disease is a degenerative condition that affects the central nervous system. It causes movement disorders, such as tremors, rigidity and balance problems. About 500,000 Americans have Parkinson\'s disease, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\n\nFlavonoids are substances found in plant foods that help prevent damage to the body\'s cells, known as oxidative damage. Anthocyanins are a type of flavonoid plentiful in such berries as strawberries and blueberries.\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed nutrition and health data from almost 50,000 men enrolled in the Health Professional Follow-Up Study and more than 80,000 women participating in the Nurses\' Health Study.\n\nThe researchers looked at dietary intake of five major flavonoid sources: tea, berries, apples, orange juice and red wine.\n\nOver 20 to 22 years of follow-up, 805 people developed Parkinson\'s disease -- 438 men and 367 women.\n\nWhen researchers compared those who ate the most flavonoids with those who ate the least, they found that only men saw a statistically significant benefit, lowering their risk of Parkinson\'s by 40 percent.\n\nGao said it wasn\'t clear why only men benefited from the extra flavonoid intake, but he noted that other studies have also found differences between men and women. Gao said it\'s not clear if there\'s a biological mechanism causing these differences, or another factor.\n\nBut, when the researchers looked at the dietary compounds individually, it was clear that berries could benefit both men and women, lowering the risk of Parkinson\'s disease by about 25 percent for those who had at least two servings of berries a week.\n\nGao said that anthocyanins protect the cells from oxidative damage and they also have an anti-inflammatory effect, which may be how berries help to reduce Parkinson\'s risk.\n\nThe study findings should be interpreted cautiously because the participants were mostly white professionals, and the results might not apply to other ethnic groups. Also, recollections of dietary intake may be faulty, and it\'s possible that other properties of fruits and vegetables might have influenced the results, the authors said.\n\nDr. Michael Okun, medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation, said, ""It is exciting to see research emerging about modifiable dietary issues that may affect the risk of getting diseases such as Parkinson\'s.""\n\nBut, he added, it\'s important for people to realize that this research isn\'t applicable to people who already have the disease.\n\nHe also said it will be important to confirm these findings in other studies and learn the mechanism of how berries and other flavonoids appear to offer some protection against Parkinson\'s disease.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about Parkinson\'s disease from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.']",Inaccurate language to describe an observational study was the main problem in this story about how certain foods may affect the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.,"Here’s what we thought could have been handled better:

They range from patient demands to malpractice fears to financial incentives and doctors’ own lack of understanding of the risks and benefits of screening.\n\n“There are a lot of pressures,“ said Dr. Gerald L. Andriole, a urologic surgeon at Washington University. “It is not all pure data that is promoting aggressive screening.” Dr. Andriole is directing a National Cancer Institute study of 76,000 men that failed to find a screening benefit after 10 years. The men were aged 55 to 74 when the study began. P.S.A. screening is controversial at any age. Screening proponents say the cancer institute study was flawed and point to a European study of 162,000 men aged 55 to 69 that showed a 20 percent drop in the prostate cancer death rate with screening.\n\nScreening critics say the European study was flawed and add that there is a logical reason it has been hard to show a screening benefit.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey note that prostate cancer is a common cancer, found in most men’s prostates on autopsy, although often the men had no idea they had it. The cancer can be lethal, but it usually grows so slowly that men die with it, not because of it.\n\nFor most men, screening only has harms because it leads to biopsies and treatments with unpleasant side effects. And, they say, it might not help cure many deadly prostate cancers because those cancers may have already spread outside the prostate, microscopically seeding other organs, long before a P.S.A. test indicates a possible problem.\n\nA positive P.S.A. test usually leads to a biopsy and then, if cancer is found, to a decision about whether to treat it. Nearly all men opt for treatment, which includes surgery to remove the prostate or radiation to destroy the cancer. Side effects can include impotence and incontinence.\n\nEven younger men should weigh the harms of screening, says Dr. Lisa Schwartz of Dartmouth Medical School. “You also have the potential to wreck their lives,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne reason treatment is the most common choice is that it is hard to know if a cancer is lethal. Pathologists can distinguish between cancers that look particularly aggressive and those that do not, but there is a real possibility that even if tissue obtained at a biopsy has only less aggressive tumor cells, more aggressive cells might still be lurking in the prostate.\n\nBut even with this uncertainty, prostate cancer specialists say, most men who are treated would not have died of prostate cancer, and that is especially true for elderly men, in particular those who are frail and have a limited life expectancy.

And doctors, he added, have many inducements to screen. They often are afraid they could be sued if they do not screen and a man is found to have a lethal cancer. And there are financial incentives.\n\n“Urologists make money by finding ways to biopsy men and administer treatments,” Dr. Andriole said. Screening, he added, “is promoted by hospitals and industry.” And, he added, “many patients demand it.”\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Brooks of the cancer society says he travels the country and talks to primary care doctors about screening, and has learned that many have misconceptions about the test’s benefits.\n\n“They often don’t appreciate the downside of screening,” Dr. Brooks said, “and they don’t appreciate the delay in benefit.” In addition, Dr. Brooks said, primary care doctors often “overestimate the likelihood that early detection of prostate cancer will lead to survival benefits.”\n\nAdded to that, Dr. Brooks said, is the length of time it takes to discuss the pros and cons of screening with patients. Often it is easier to just order the test.\n\nDr. Bruce Roth, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, said that ideally, a doctor should take a man’s overall health into account and not just go by age in ordering P.S.A. tests. But if a man has been screened year after year, it can be hard to suggest he stop because he may not live much longer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome men say the cautions just do not apply to them.\n\nJ. Allen Wheeler, who is 82 and lives in Portland, Ore., said he had his most recent P.S.A. test in January.

He would like to know if he has cancer, he says, although he may decide not to be treated.\n\nA 75-year-old Connecticut man said he had the test because he was healthy and wanted to stay that way.\n\n“I think I am going to live to be 100,” he said, asking that his name be withheld to protect his privacy.

Despite its longtime use, warfarin remains tricky to dose because a person\'s genetic makeup influences how the drug is processed in the body. Too much warfarin can cause internal bleeding; too little warfarin fails to prevent blood clots.\n\nNow, a new study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that dosing warfarin (Coumadin and others) is safer -- producing fewer adverse events such as hemorrhage -- when key elements of a patient\'s genetic makeup are considered.\n\nThe research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis).\n\n""Physicians have been prescribing warfarin since the Eisenhower administration,"" said first author Brian F. Gage, MD, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ""It\'s a widely used anticoagulant, but it causes more major adverse events than any other oral drug. Thousands of patients end up in the emergency department or hospital because of warfarin-induced bleeding. But we continue to prescribe it because it is highly effective, reversible and inexpensive. So our goal is to make warfarin safer. GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy.""\n\nPatients in the trial were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received warfarin dosing based on standard factors such as age, height and weight; the second group was dosed based on these clinical factors plus genetic variants. Participating sites in the trial included Washington University School of Medicine, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, Intermountain Healthcare, University of Utah, and Rush University Medical Center.\n\nOf the 789 patients who were dosed in the traditional manner, 116 experienced at least one adverse event (14.7 percent). Of the 808 patients whose warfarin dosing was guided by genetic testing, 87 experienced an adverse event (10.8 percent). Compared with patients receiving traditional warfarin dosing, patients dosed with the genetic approach had a 27 percent reduction in adverse events, which was statistically different. The adverse events were bleeding, formation of blood clots in the veins and warfarin overdoses. No patient died during the trial.\n\nEarlier studies looking at whether genetic testing could improve warfarin dosing had produced conflicting results. However, these studies were smaller and considered fewer genes than GIFT. GIFT enrolled 1,600 patients age 65 and older at high risk of blood clots because they underwent hip- or knee-replacement surgeries.\n\nUnlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy. Genetic variants were assessed on a commercial platform called GenMarkDx. Variants in one gene affect vitamin K recycling. Variants in another gene affect warfarin sensitivity. Variants in the third gene alter warfarin metabolism in the liver and can cause an overdose if the dose is not adjusted soon enough.\n\n""There are additional genetic variants that may help to guide warfarin dosing, especially among patients with African ancestry,"" Gage said. In the future, we hope to quantify how these variants affect warfarin.""\n\nGage also noted how health-care costs relate to dosing warfarin in a genetically guided manner. ""Although genetic testing is more expensive than clinical dosing, the cost is falling,"" he said. ""In our study, we estimated that genetic testing costs less than $200 per person, which is less than one month of a newer anticoagulant.""\n\n###\n\nThis work was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers R01HL097036 and UL1TR000448; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, grant number CAG-00400N; and GenMarkDx, which supplied instrumentation.\n\nGage BF, Bass AR, Lin H, Woller SC, Stevens SM, Al-Hammadi N, Li J, Rodriguez Jr. T, Miller JP, McMillin GA, Pendleton RC, Jaffer AK, King CR, DeVore B, Porche-Sorbet R, Napoli L, Merritt K, Thompson AM, Hyun G, Anderson JL, Hollomon W, Barrack RL, Nunley RM, Moskowitz G, Davila-Roman V and Eby CS for the GIFT investigators.

(It doesn’t apply.),"This news release describes results of a study designed to learn whether testing for the presence of three gene variants could make dosing with the blood thinner warfarin safer for patients given the drug to prevent blood clots after joint replacement surgery.
The study found a modest reduction in the risk of bleeding or clots (from over- or under-dosing) in those whose regimens were developed in part by genetic testing for the variants, compared to those whose doses were calculated without the genetic testing.
The release does an overall good job in describing the study, its purpose and design; and in quantifying the results. It could have been even stronger if it had included more information about newer alternatives to warfarin that are growing in use and an explicit statement that no one is yet recommending routine genetic testing for the variants based on this study. And although the headline somewhat over promises clinical benefit at this point in time, thoughtful readers will come away with a decent understanding of the context of the research and its potential impact.

In 2009, he had routine blood work that revealed an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. When PSA is above 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood, it can be one of the first signs of a prostate tumor. Harder’s PSA was 9.\n\nBy the time Harder saw a urologist, it had skyrocketed to 20. His doctor recommended the traditional next step: a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, which involves taking random tissue samples from 12 cross sections of the prostate.\n\nOver the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. They were all inconclusive.\n\n“It is frustrating to have a bunch of biopsies with a rising PSA and no proof of cancer,” Harder said.\n\nAfter Harder’s third biopsy, his urologist was ready to throw in the towel, and that’s when Harder was referred to Jinxing Yu, M.D., at VCU Health. By then, Harder’s PSA was around 30.\n\nYu is the director of oncologic and prostate imaging in the Department of Radiology at VCU. Over the past five years, he has developed diagnostic techniques using MRI technology to investigate difficult cases like Harder’s.\n\nAfter one MRI, Yu found Harder’s tumor. After that, Yu performed a targeted biopsy guided by the MRI scanner, allowing him to take tissue samples directly from the tumor.\n\nHarder finally had a diagnosis.\n\nIn 2012, he started on a treatment plan: hormone therapy for six months to shrink the tumor and prostate, and then external beam radiation to finish the job. Today, his PSA is normal.\n\nOther patients who continue to hit a brick wall with negative results from TRUS biopsies yet persistently high PSA levels may not be as fortunate.\n\n“A patient had 10 TRUS biopsies and his doctors still couldn’t find a tumor,” Yu said. “If you do not have this kind of advanced imaging, sometimes a patient runs into a situation when a tumor can’t be found and treated because it’s too late — it has already metastasized. He ends up diagnosed with cancer only after the tumor has spread to his bone or lymph nodes years later.”\n\nPrecise imaging leads to detection\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for the prostate have provided relief for patients like Harder who have not been able to get an accurate diagnosis. When caught early, prostate cancer is highly treatable.\n\nMuch like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. VCU Medical Center is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country doing advanced multiparametric MRI, which involves taking three different types of imaging sequences of the prostate.\n\nEach of the sequences — T2 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging — tells a story, and together they can be used to make a diagnosis with more than 90 percent accuracy.\n\nInterpreting a prostate MRI to be able to correctly diagnose cancer is a skill that can take years to develop. Yu and his team look for certain patterns that are typical of cancer on each of the different sequences.\n\n“If we put those characteristic features together from each sequence then we can say with a high degree of confidence that this area is concerning for cancer and potentially target it for biopsy,” said Sarah Winks, M.D., an attending physician in the Department of Radiology.\n\nAn MRI can also help determine how aggressive a tumor is, Yu said, and indicates if the tumor extends outside of the prostate and involves other areas — all information that helps urologists and radiation oncologists determine the best course of treatment.\n\nTraditional meets emerging technology\n\nIn addition to enhancing detection of prostate cancer, magnetic resonance technology also enhances the biopsy process with a procedure called magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy. MRI scans are overlaid with real-time ultrasound images to guide the biopsy needle to the tumor.\n\nIn 2014, VCU Health’s Department of Radiology, supported by the Division of Urology in the Department of Surgery, purchased ultrasound/MRI fusion biopsy equipment. Prior to this, Yu’s team had performed targeted MRI biopsies with the patient being moved in and out of the MRI scanner as the needle was guided to the target area — a sort of stop-motion procedure that could take up to an hour. The new equipment has simplified and shortened the process to about 20 minutes.\n\nA study published in 2015 by the Center for Cancer Research found that fusion biopsy is 30 percent more accurate in diagnosing high-risk, aggressive cancers than a TRUS biopsy. It is also much better at finding tumors in the anterior part of the prostate, near where Harder’s tumor was located.\n\nYu credits the technology and also having a dedicated team that can perform multiparametric-MRI, read the MRI scans and conduct biopsies with a very high success rate.\n\n“At most places, there will be a radiologist reading the MR image and a clinician performing the biopsy. The person reading the image and person putting in the needle is different,” Yu said. “Sometimes you don’t get the same result. We do both. That’s one of our strengths.”\n\nNew path to diagnosis\n\nYu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients’ care. “Five years ago, 95 percent of patients with prostate cancer or a high PSA would never get any imaging,” Yu said. “Right now, I think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging.” Sometimes, these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of Yu’s patients did last year.\n\nLast August, Jim Grandon of Colville, Washington, discovered he had a PSA of 5.3. It was elevated from the 4.1 measurement that he had registered for a few years. The rising PSA was cause for concern. Instead of going through with an immediate TRUS biopsy recommended by his urologist, he decided to research next steps.\n\n“With just going in and doing a blind biopsy like most urologists will do, you have anywhere from 35 to 45 percent success rate,” Grandon said. “I found three or four places around the country with a biopsy success rate of over 85 percent. When I went back to my urologist, he said, ‘Why spend money flying around the country when we can take care of you here?’ I said, ‘Because 85 percent is better than 40 percent.’”\n\nVCU Medical Center was one of the places Grandon had researched to get his diagnostic testing done, and a few phone calls later, he was on a plane flying across the country to see Yu.\n\nOn his second day in Richmond, Grandon had an MRI that showed a lesion. The next day, Yu biopsied it. On the fourth day, Grandon flew home and began researching treatment options. He opted for brachytherapy followed by external radiation at a clinic closer to home, and recently completed his treatment.\n\nA change in care\n\nMore and more, physicians are hearing about and understanding the benefits of MRI technology for prostate care, which has also been helpful in preventing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. According to the Center for Cancer Research study, MRI targeted biopsies detect 17 percent fewer low-risk tumors. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.\n\nWhen Yu started prostate MRI screening in 2011, his team performed about 50 scans per year. Now, with the support of Massey Cancer Center, Urology and Radiation Oncology, they are doing about 1,200 multiparametric-MRI and 200 imaging guided biopsies per year. He estimates the volume will continue to increase because VCU will attract patients not only from the Greater Richmond area but also patients such as Grandon from other parts of the country.\n\nYu hopes the advanced technology means positive changes in the standard of care. He speculates that in the same way women have a baseline mammogram, men would have a baseline prostate MRI and periodic magnetic resonance scans if warranted by bloodwork and family history.']",Do targeted biopsies ultimately lead to fewer deaths as claimed in the release? Years of prostate cancer research hasn’t borne that out.,"This news release touts a high-definition scan called multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MS-MRI), shown in studies to increase the accuracy of prostate cancer detection. The scan is used to identify suspicious lesions in the prostate that can be biopsied for cancer. A study at the Center for Cancer Research (National Cancer Institute, NCI) in Bethesda, Md., showed that targeted MRI-guided biopsies found more cases of high-risk prostate cancer while detecting fewer low-risk cancers compared with standard biopsies.
The news release presents this data but does not mention cost, associated risks, and the fact that more research is needed on whether targeted biopsies ultimately lead to fewer deaths. The news release hypes the procedure as having a “more than 90 percent success rate” without explaining what that means. Moreover, it stokes fear by selectively describing cancer cases discovered by MRI and stating that without advanced imaging cancer may not be found until it’s “too late.”  Reading this, one might conclude that all men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level would do well to hop on the next plane to Richmond.

Their findings are published in the Journal of Applied Research on Children.\n\n""Obesity is the most pressing health issue facing us today,"" said Craig Johnston, HHP assistant professor. ""We\'d like to think it\'s preventable, but from where I sit right now, there hasn\'t been a lot shown to be very effective on a large scale.""\n\nThe study acknowledged that snacking is more common during the adolescent years and that the unhealthy eating habit can lead to an unhealthy weight. This is especially true if a student doesn\'t have access to other meals during the school day.\n\n""We have a lot of kids skipping meals for a whole bunch of reasons,"" he said. ""What we found is that kids get home from school around 4 p.m. There\'s less supervision by parents and less structure. Kids are sitting down at the TV and eating, eating, eating because they really didn\'t eat at school.""\n\nInstructors guided 257 Latino adolescents from three Houston-area charter schools through a program of physical activity and nutrition education. About half the students received a snack of peanuts or peanut butter three to four times a week, while the rest received the snack fewer than once a week. The snack was administered after school as students were boarding the school bus to go home. Peanuts were chosen because nuts are nutrient-dense snacks that promote a feeling of being full.\n\nFollowing the 12-week intervention, students spent 12 more weeks maintaining the healthy snacking habit. At the end of the period, those students who received the snack more regularly experienced a decrease in their overall BMI (-.7kg/m2) compared to those who did not receive the regular peanut snack (-.3kg/m2). The researchers conclude that afterschool programs and schools can replace energy dense, unhealthy snacks with peanuts to provide a healthier alternative for children (researchers in the study ensured students did not suffer from nut allergies).\n\nJohnston says the fight against obesity needs creative solutions that help people manage their weight, appetite and hunger by offering socially acceptable food choices.\n\n""Schools are doing a great job of teaching kids, getting them workforce ready, and a whole bunch of other things. We\'ve just got to make sure that our kids are going to live long, happy lives with that kind of education,"" he said.\n\nParticipants in the study were part of a larger longitudinal study on a school-based obesity intervention program. The Family Lifestyle Overweight (FLOW) Prevention Program is a school-based pediatric intervention for urban, low-income, minority students.\n\n###']","This news release focuses on the important issue of childhood obesity, but may draw misleading conclusions.","Carrying a misleading headline, and some not-quite-accurate and confusing descriptions of the study, this news release describes research designed to evaluate the impact on overweight or obese teens of complying with a healthier snacking regimen — one involving peanuts and peanut butter. It could have been markedly strengthened by less emphasis on quotes stating the obvious and questionable (“…unhealthy eating  habit(s) can lead to an unhealthy weight”; “snacking is more common during the adolescent years”), and more emphasis on the design, context and hopeful outcome of this small, but rigorous randomized controlled intervention trial.

Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\nThere were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU\'s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n""The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,"" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n""For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it\'s never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it\'s never too early,"" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\n###\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives. In 2016, he was ranked the No. 14 ""Top Scientist in the World"" with an H-index of 173.\n\nAbout the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine:\n\nFAU\'s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine is one of 145 accredited medical schools in the U.S. The college was launched in 2010, when the Florida Board of Governors made a landmark decision authorizing FAU to award the M.D. degree. After receiving approval from the Florida legislature and the governor, it became the 134th allopathic medical school in North America. With more than 70 full and part-time faculty and more than 1,300 affiliate faculty, the college matriculates 64 medical students each year and has been nationally recognized for its innovative curriculum. To further FAU\'s commitment to increase much needed medical residency positions in Palm Beach County and to ensure that the region will continue to have an adequate and well-trained physician workforce, the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine Consortium for Graduate Medical Education (GME) was formed in fall 2011 with five leading hospitals in Palm Beach County. In June 2014, FAU\'s College of Medicine welcomed its inaugural class of 36 residents in its first University-sponsored residency in internal medicine.\n\nAbout Florida Atlantic University:']",This release urges greater use of a drug while offering “reassurance” to clinicians and patients of its safety and effectiveness. The expert making the claims should also reassure us that his financial ties to the drug maker had no bearing on his analysis.,"This news release from Florida Atlantic University amplifies a bold claim made in a medical journal commentary that the FDA’s “black box” warnings on varenicline (Chantix) medication labels encouraged many people to avoid the drug — and that failure to use the drug caused thousands of people to die prematurely from heart attacks and cardiovascular disease.
That’s a speculative claim, and one that the release does not back up with evidence.
The release also urges wider use of Chantix, a prescription medication. The FDA required Chantix to carry the warning of side effects from 2009 until December 2016. The release does not address the lingering debate over the safety of Chantix — or note that the senior author of the commentary has served as an advisor to Pfizer, the company that sells Chantix.

Overall, the women ages 50 and over had a total of 31,385 mammograms, 3,504 callbacks (11.2% recall rate), 836 biopsies, and 270 cancers detected. By adding the women ages 40-49 to the screening population of 50 and over, the overall callback rate increased 1.5%, the biopsy rate increased 0.1% and 19.3% more cancers were detected.\n\nThe study results showed that there was a higher number of callbacks among women ages 40-49 compared to women ages 50-59 (17% compared with 12.5%) and to women ages 60-69 (17% compared with 10.2%). There was also a lower positive biopsy rate among women ages 40-49 compared with women over 50.

These tests might tell,"['(CNN) -- Most heart attacks strike with no warning, but doctors now have a clearer picture than ever before of who is most likely to have one, says Dr. Arthur Agatston, a Miami cardiologist and author of the best-selling South Beach diet books.\n\nAgatston says relatively new imaging tests give real-time pictures showing whether plaque is building up in key blood vessels, alerting doctor and patient to an increased risk of a potentially deadly heart attack.\n\n""Unless you do the imaging, you are really playing Russian roulette with your life,"" he said.\n\nAgatston invented one of the imaging tests, the coronary calcium scan, which looks at plaque in the arteries leading to the heart. Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)\n\nThe other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nAmerican Heart Association: Learn and live\n\nBoth tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.\n\nOne large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the ""good"" cholesterol.\n\nAgatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.\n\nMost hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.\n\nCardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.\n\nHigh-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don\'t think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.\n\n""There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,"" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University\n\nA good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.\n\n""Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?"" she asked.\n\nA calcium score would answer that question, she says.\n\nThere\'s a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient\'s LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.\n\n""There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don\'t get into the vessel wall,"" Agatston says.\n\nThese new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.\n\n""One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices.

Hall, M.D., M.Div., M.H.Sc., of the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System and University of Pittsburgh, and colleagues examined the effect of a Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) on death and complications by comparing the surgical outcomes of patients treated before and after implementation of the FSI.\n\nAs the U.S. population ages, the number of operations performed on elderly patients will likely increase. Frailty predicts postoperative mortality and illness more than age alone, thus presenting opportunities to identify the highest-risk surgical patients and provide tailored clinical care to improve their outcomes. This study included 9,153 patients (average age, 60 years) from a Veterans Affairs medical center who presented for major, elective, noncardiac surgery. Preoperative frailty was assessed with the Risk Analysis Index (RAI; a 14-item questionnaire), and the records of all frail patients (as determined by a certain RAI score) were flagged for administrative review by the chief of surgery (or designee) before the scheduled operation. On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient’s frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input.\n\nThe researchers found that overall 30-day mortality decreased from 1.6 percent (84 of 5,275 patients) to 0.7 percent (26 of 3,878 patients) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2 percent to 3.8 percent), although mortality rates also decreased among the robust patients (1.2 percent to 0.3 percent). The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180 and 365 days.\n\n“The ultimate cause of the survival benefit is likely multifactorial, including changes in preoperative decision making, intraoperative management, and postoperative rescue,” the authors write.\n\n“This study reveals the feasibility of facility-wide frailty screening in elective surgical populations. It also suggests the potential to improve postoperative survival among the frail through systematic administrative screening, review, and optimization of perioperative plans. The absolute reduction in 180-day mortality among frail patients was more than 19 percent, with improvement remaining robust even after controlling for age, frailty, and predicted mortality.”\n\n(JAMA Surgery.

That typically happens to people with the mysterious illness commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Research findings from Stanford University released Monday could point the way to a long-sought diagnostic laboratory test for the condition, and possibly a first-ever treatment.\n\nBelieved to affect at least a million people in the U.S., the condition is now increasingly termed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS for short.\n\nMany patients see the name ""chronic fatigue syndrome"" as trivializing and misleading, giving the impression that they\'re simply tired or depressed. In fact, they\'re experiencing profound exhaustion that isn\'t relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, ""brain fog"" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. (A 2015 Institute of Medicine report proposed the name ""systemic exertion intolerance disease,"" but it hasn\'t really stuck.)\n\nThe symptoms can range from mild to extremely severe, with about a quarter of patients so ill they\'re mostly or completely confined to bed. Now, the Stanford researchers have linked ME/CFS to variations in certain cytokines, immune-signaling proteins, that track with illness severity. The study results were published online Monday in the the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. The study involved 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Out of 51 cytokines investigated via sophisticated fluorescence-based testing, only two of the cytokines differed, in their total concentrations, between the ME/CFS and control groups.\n\nBut, levels of 17 of the cytokines varied dramatically between the patients with mild versus severe ME/CFS symptoms. Of those 17 cytokines, 13 were types that promote inflammation. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness.\n\n""This is a field that has been full of skepticism and misconception, where patients have been viewed to have invented their disease. These data clearly show the contrary, and demonstrate what can be achieved when we couple good research design with new technology,"" lead author Dr. Jose Montoya, professor of infectious diseases at Stanford, tells Shots.\n\nAccording to Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, a Harvard internist and epidemiologist who has written a commentary to accompany the study, ""For many years medical scientists have speculated that the symptoms of ME/CFS might be caused by cytokines, molecules that the immune system use to wage war against foreign invaders of the body. Past studies have shown high levels of many cytokines but it was not clear that these high levels were causing symptoms.""\n\nWhat the latest research shows, Komaroff tells Shots, is that ""levels of many cytokines do correlate with symptoms: The higher the blood level, the worse the symptoms. That supports the theory that the cytokines are a cause of the symptoms.""\n\nSo why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? Simply put, Montoya says, those tests aren\'t measuring the right things.\n\nTwo classic laboratory measures of inflammation are sedimentation rate — the ability of red blood cells to clump together, which isn\'t a factor in ME/CFS — and C-reactive protein, which reflects levels of a single cytokine that wasn\'t one of those linked to severity in this study.\n\n""Inflammation is much more complicated than two imperfect old measures,"" Montoya says. ""We\'re showing an inflammation that has not been seen before.""\n\nThe multidisciplinary Stanford team is now working on developing a panel that could be used commercially, that would test for around five of the 17 cytokines and would likely involve the doctor first classifying patients by severity in order to interpret the results. Such a test could both establish the diagnosis and serve to monitor patients\' responses to treatment.\n\nWhat\'s more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy. Montoya hopes that by publishing these findings ""a team of researchers somewhere in the world will see these cytokines and say they have the drug for that inflammation. We hope drug companies will pursue it.""\n\nIndeed, a major drug trial is now being conducted in Norway investigating whether the immune-modifying drug rituximab alleviates ME/CFS symptoms, after preliminary studies suggested that it did in some patients. Interestingly, the drug is approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases and also non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that one study found uniquely occurs at a higher rate among older people with ME/CFS.\n\nKomaroff also notes a recent increase in research funding by the National Institutes of Health, which has included a comprehensive in-house study aimed at unraveling the underlying causes of the condition.\n\nAnd in an ongoing privately funded study, Stanford geneticist Ron Davis and a team including three Nobel laureates is taking a similar ""big data"" approach to investigate a group of ME/CFS patients who are all severely ill, including Davis\' own adult son.\n\n""There is much to learn,"" Komaroff writes, in the journal. ""Hopefully, a decade from now, ""doctors will know better what to measure and, more importantly, what to do to ease the suffering caused by this illness.""\n\nMiriam E. Tucker is a freelance journalist specializing in medicine and health. You can follow her on Twitter @MiriamETucker.']","Also, the story talks about work to develop a commercially available test, but there is no discussion of what such a test might cost.","
This story about the potential use of cytokine testing to diagnose and then guide the treatment of chronic fatigue is cautiously worded. It reports that a new study “could point the way.”
Yet even with such careful language, readers are likely to get an inflated sense of what the latest study actually reported, because the story seems to assume that high levels of cytokines are causing CFS/ME and that tracking these levels will help guide treatment. However, the study under discussion, which is observational in nature, is incapable of proving such a relationship. As such, it’s too early to suggest that these lab markers can be used to diagnose the condition or monitor treatment — at least not without the inclusion of strong qualifying language.

The findings will appear in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease.\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is the most common type of dementia. Symptoms include serious memory loss, confusion, and mood changes that develop gradually and worsen with time.\n\nThe new study included 124 people aged 65 to 88 who had mild cognitive impairment, which is the medical term for mild memory loss. About 15% of people with MCI develop full-blown Alzheimer\'s disease each year.\n\nIn the study, blood levels of caffeine were more than 50% lower among people with MCI who developed Alzheimer\'s during follow-up, when compared with their counterparts who did not worsen.

Robot surgery may not be the answer,"['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Robots may not help doctors do a better job on some surgeries, according to a new study.\n\nSurgeons treating women with endometriosis - a chronic condition that affects more than 5 million women and adolescent girls in the U.S. - didn’t get better or faster results when they used a robotic system.\n\nWith the surgeon alone, “the incision is smaller (and) the manipulations are more controlled,” Dr. Ceana Nezhat, an author on the study and the chair of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Northside Hospital in Atlanta, told Reuters Health.\n\nBecause the robot lets the surgeon get a better picture of the inside of the body, the authors had expected that surgeries using the robot would go more smoothly than those without it.\n\nTo test this idea, they looked back at 78 minor surgeries that were done on women with endometriosis - half using the assistance of a robot, half without it.\n\nThere was no difference in how much blood patients lost, and there were no complications in either group. But robotic surgeries took longer than non-robotic surgeries by about 40 minutes - 3 hours and 11 minutes compared to 2 hours and 29 minutes, on average. Longer surgeries often mean a more tired surgeon and more chances for things to go wrong.\n\nThe robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one.\n\nSurgical robots do not operate on their own. Rather, surgeons move electronic instruments that are linked to the movement of other instruments inside the body, while they watch a three-dimensional image of what’s going on inside. One robot can cost around $1.5 million.\n\n“We were surprised that (surgery with the robot) did not have better outcomes than (the surgeon alone), as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better,” the authors write.\n\nHowever, they suggest that more complicated procedures for severe endometriosis, which might require open surgery, would benefit from the help of a robot.\n\nInexperienced doctors might also take advantage of the robot for surgery if they don’t think they have the skills to do the surgery with only a small cut, Dr. Nezhat said. In this case, the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one.\n\nDr. Tommaso Falcone, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Cleveland Clinic, said this study shows that more technology is not always better. Using a robot for basic surgery, like the kind studied here, would be like using a computer to do addition, he told Reuters Health.\n\n“I just need a calculator to add a few things,” said Falcone, who was not involved in the study. “Yes it’s true that if I’ve got that supercomputer maybe it looks better. But all I need to do is add 5 and 5.”\n\nEspecially in a time of concern over rising medical costs, “we should not simply use the highly sophisticated technology just because it’s there,” Falcone said.\n\nSOURCE: here\n\nFertility and Sterility, online May 26, 2010.']","This story is important because it highlights an example where robots may not improve outcomes and in fact may add to cost.  The story does not explore this fully, however.","What could have been a John Henry style man-triumphs-over-technology story with outsized language and overheated quotes turns out to be a fairly straightforward, clear-eyed piece of reporting – but with some missing elements.

Researchers did not have information on the doses of fish oil that were taken by women in the study.\n\nExactly how fish oil may affect breast cancer risk is not fully understood, but it may be related to its strong anti-inflammatory properties. Some research suggests that inflammation plays a role in the development of breast and other cancers. Other studies have not found a link between eating more fatty fish and breast cancer risk, but it may be that the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil supplements is much higher than what is typically found in the diet.\n\nOther supplements were not linked to breast cancer risk in the new study, including black cohosh, dong quai, soy, and St. John\'s wort, which are often taken to relieve some of the symptoms of menopause.\n\nThe new research is part of the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) study, which included data from women 50 to 76 years old from Washington state.']","Four sources were interviewed – a strength of this story – delivering appropriate caveats.

It is estimated that the condition affects one in 110 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n""There is a serious unmet need in the autism world, where diagnosis is currently done by subjective reports, and after the child has missed many developmental milestones,"" said lead researcher Joy Hirsch, a professor of functional neuroradiology, neuroscience and psychology, and director of the Functional MRI Laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\n""It is now possible to develop an objective imaging diagnostic,"" she said.

However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch\'s group noted.\n\nTo further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children\'s Medical Center of New York in Lake Success, said that ""although the investigators did indeed find significant differences on neuroimaging between controls and autistic children, the clinical utility from a diagnostic standpoint is unclear.""\n\nThere are important limitations to the study, Adesman said.\n\nFor one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.\n\n""It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed,"" he explained.\n\n""The other major limitation of this study is that the investigators did not look at whether these brain differences are specific to children with autism, or if they would also be seen, for example, in children with language delays who are not autistic,"" Adesman said.\n\nHirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.\n\n""There are questions about how this varies across the severity of autism. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?"" she asked. ""These are things that aren\'t known.""\n\nFurther work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. ""This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,"" she said.\n\nThis test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Robert F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that ""it\'s nice to have an objective measure, but it doesn\'t really do much.""\n\nUltimately, he said, ""the diagnosis of autism is a clinical diagnosis. I see this as having more implications for research into the pathophysiology of autism.""\n\nHowever, if this test could be done in really young children, it might help identify autism so that treatment can begin early, Lopez-Alberola suggested. ""We know the earlier we begin interventions, the greater the likelihood of better outcome,"" he said.\n\n""Although this technique holds promise for identifying infants at risk for autism, it still needs to be determined whether the atypical patterns of brain activation are specific to autism,"" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for Autism Speaks.\n\n""It is possible that children who have delayed language but not autism would also show the same pattern.

Dr. Kevin Smith says frequent migraine sufferers shouldn't count out the possibility the pain may be from a deviated septum. Photo: BILLY SMITH II, CHRONICLE Photo: BILLY SMITH II, CHRONICLE Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Constant migraines may be from unlikely culprit: a deviated septum 1 / 1 Back to Gallery\n\nIf you suffer from chronic or migraine headaches, Dr. Kevin Smith urges you to consider the real problem might be in your nose.\n\nSmith, an ear, nose and throat and facial plastic surgeon in Houston, has written The Migraine Imposter to help patients find a simpler cure for what can seem like a complex problem.\n\nFor 17 years Smith has treated patients who have been diagnosed with migraine headaches but really have a deviated septum, which occurs when the partition separating the left and right nasal airways becomes displaced.\n\nHe believes this deviation in the nose can touch sensitive tissue that, in turn, triggers episodic headaches, often mistaken as migraines. At least 32 million Americans are believed to be affected by migraines.\n\n“What I am proposing is that if after you are referred to a neurologist and the MRI of your brain turns out negative (for tumor or aneurysm), your next step should be to get a CT scan of the sinuses,” Smith said.\n\nIf a CT scan shows a septal deviation, a 20-minute procedure called a septoplasty can often solve the problem. Smith said that within his practice, some 90 percent of patients have gotten headache relief after a deviated septum is repaired.\n\nSymptoms to watch for include pain in the forehead, temple, area around the eyes, cheeks and top of the head, Smith said.\n\nA deviated septum is often caused by trauma to your nose, such as having broken your nose, he said, adding that many professional athletes who suffer from migraines may actually have a deviated septum caused by contact sports.\n\n“National Football League player Percy Harvin missed a lot of practice because of migraines,” Smith said. “If a deviated septum is caused by trauma and you have an NFL player with migraines who has been subjected to trauma by playing this sport, there is a high likelihood that he has a deviated septum.”\n\nHouston resident Cheryl Guthrie isn't an athlete, but suffered from migraines since she was a little girl.\n\n“Migraines are awful. You really can't function. I had seen Dr. Smith on a program and tucked (the information) away in a drawer,” Guthrie said. “Finally, he was my last resort.”\n\nIf Smith's hunch is correct, he believes septoplasties can have a big impact on finances and help patients find speedier relief. Often, he said, headache sufferers get passed around to doctors of many specialties, from general practitioners to ear, nose and throat specialists and neurosurgeons as well as oral surgeons, opthalmologists and pain specialists.\n\n“These headaches can cost millions of dollars in lost revenue and a shortened career if sports players never find the reason for their headaches,” Smith said. “I also treated one lady who had suffered 15 years and had 14 MRIs performed in the brain before she was diagnosed with a septal deviation. I want to alleviate health care expenses and health care waste for my patients.”\n\nTo diagnose the problem, Smith said he sprays decongestant up a patients nose and then examines it to see if there are any bends in the back of the nose. A CT scan is then used to confirm the septal deviation.\n\nDr. Gina Rizzo of Gulfcoast MRI and Diagnostic Centers, agrees with Smith and urges physicians to consider this simple screening. “A screening of the sinuses should not be overlooked in the case of recurrent headaches that have been ruled out as tumors or aneurysms in the brain,” Rizzo said.\n\nkamaria.monmouth@chron.com""]",Troublingly shallow story on one doctor’s book and his claims of surgical relief of migraines. ,"This story advances the claims of a book author/ear, nose and throat surgeon who says that many patients with migraines actually suffer from migraine-like headaches caused by a deviated septum in the nose. While the idea sounds reasonable enough, what’s lacking here is evidence. Most problematic is that the story unquestioningly passes along the author’s claim — based entirely on his own practice data — that he has a 90% success rate when treating headache patients with deviated septums. That’s a statistic that will probably help sell lots of books and drive more patients to the author’s practice, but we doubt it accurately reflects the benefits that the typical patient can expect from this treatment. Also troubling is the story’s failure to mention any possible harms associated with the surgery promoted in the book. Considering that septoplasty itself can provoke new chronic pain in some patients, this omission is particularly glaring.

It was funded by a grant from the government\'s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. ""Acupuncture that we have tested works for pregnant, depressed women,"" said Rachel Manber, a study author and professor at Stanford University. However, ""no single study is enough to make policy recommendations,"" she said.\n\nDepression in pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is associated in some studies with poorer cognitive and emotional development in children. Some have linked depression in pregnancy and low birth weight.\n\nAs many as 14% of pregnant women are thought to develop a significant depression at some point during their pregnancy, according to the study authors, comparable to numbers who suffer from postpartum depression. Antidepressants are generally considered safe for use in pregnancy, but research has been limited and concerns continue to grow, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. One study showed that the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension, a potentially serious lung condition, is significantly greater in newborns whose mother took antidepressants later in pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration recommends that patients and physicians ""carefully consider and discuss together"" the benefits and risks taking antidepressants during pregnancy.""Antidepressants are not an attractive option for many women,"" said Dr. Manber. ""Many women are concerned about using antidepressant medication during pregnancy.""\n\nAcupuncture, based on ancient Chinese medicine, attempts to treat conditions by stimulating points on the body, most often with needles stuck in the skin and moved by hand or electrical stimulation, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\n\nIn the study, 150 clinically depressed pregnant women who weren\'t previously taking antidepressants were randomly assigned to get either acupuncture for depression, acupuncture not specifically designed for depression, or massage for eight weeks. Those who got acupuncture targeting depression had a significantly greater decrease in depressive symptoms, compared with the other women. Some 63% of women in the acupuncture-for-depression group responded to treatment, compared with 44% in the other groups.\n\nThere wasn\'t a difference between the groups in full recovery from the depression. Though this study didn\'t compare acupuncture for depression with another active treatment, the response rates are comparable to those rates from other depression treatments in studies of non-pregnant individuals, Dr. Manber said. And future work needs to examine how acupuncture for depression compares with standard treatment like antidepressants or psychotherapy, as well as who responds to treatment and what the optimal dose of the acupuncture treatment should be.\n\nWrite to Shirley S. Wang at shirley.wang@wsj.com']","One of four stories we reviewed on this same study.  Overall, solid report.  It would have taken only a few minor additions to make this a 5-star story.

The story could have been improved in the following ways:
1. By providing more detail on the specially-designed type of acupuncture used in one arm of the study. Where could a woman seeking this treatment find it? How many practitioners are trained on this regimen?
2. By mentioning any harms of the treatment. While acupuncture is very safe, the study did report some pain and bleeding.
3. By seeking the perspective of an independent expert and not simply quoting the lead author of the study. 
4. By describing the costs or insurance coverage for acupuncture. Because insurance coverage for acupuncture varies widely, out-of-pocket expenses for the 12-session regimen could be a substantial barrier to many women seeking treatment.

Parvalbumin, a protein found in great quantities in several different fish species, has been shown to help prevent the formation of certain protein structures closely associated with Parkinson\'s disease.\n\nFish has long been considered a healthy food, linked to improved long-term cognitive health, but the reasons for this have been unclear. Omega-3 and -6, fatty acids commonly found in fish, are often assumed to be responsible, and are commonly marketed in this fashion. However, the scientific research regarding this topic has drawn mixed conclusions. Now, new research from Chalmers has shown that the protein parvalbumin, which is very common in many fish species, may be contributing to this effect.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Parkinson\'s disease is amyloid formation of a particular human protein, called alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is even sometimes referred to as the \'Parkinson\'s protein\'.\n\nWhat the Chalmers researchers have now discovered, is that parvalbumin can form amyloid structures that bind together with the alpha-synuclein protein. Parvalbumin effectively \'scavenges\' the alpha-synuclein proteins, using them for its own purposes, thus preventing them from forming their own potentially harmful amyloids later on.\n\n""Parvalbumin collects up the \'Parkinson\'s protein\' and actually prevents it from aggregating, simply by aggregating itself first,"" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, Professor and Head of the Chemical Biology division at Chalmers, and lead author on the study.\n\nWith the parvalbumin protein so highly abundant in certain fish species, increasing the amount of fish in our diet might be a simple way to fight off Parkinson\'s disease. Herring, cod, carp, and redfish, including sockeye salmon and red snapper, have particularly high levels of parvalbumin, but it is common in many other fish species too. The levels of parvalbumin can also vary greatly throughout the year.\n\n""Fish is normally a lot more nutritious at the end of the summer, because of increased metabolic activity. Levels of parvalbumin are much higher in fish after they have had a lot of sun, so it could be worthwhile increasing consumption during autumn,"" says Nathalie Scheers, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and researcher on the study. It was Nathalie who first had the inspiration to investigate parvalbumin more closely, after a previous study she did looking at biomarkers for fish consumption.\n\nOther neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\'s, ALS and Huntington\'s disease, are also caused by certain amyloid structures interfering in the brain. The team is therefore keen to research this topic further, to see if the discovery relating to Parkinson\'s disease could have implications for other neurodegenerative disorders as well. Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede stresses the importance of finding ways to combat these neurological conditions in the future:\n\n""These diseases come with age, and people are living longer and longer. There\'s going to be an explosion of these diseases in the future - and the scary part is that we currently have no cures. So we need to follow up on anything that looks promising.""\n\nA follow up study, looking at parvalbumin from another angle, is indeed planned for this autumn. Nathalie Scheers, together with Professor Ingrid Undeland, also of Chalmers, will investigate parvalbumin from herring, and its transport in human tissues.\n\n""It will be very interesting to study how parvalbumin distributes within human tissues in more depth. There could be some really exciting results.""\n\nMore About: Fish and Better Neurological Health\n\nThe link between higher consumption of fish and better long-term health for the brain has been long established. There is correlation between certain diets and decreased rates of Parkinson\'s disease - as well as other neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n""Among those who follow a Mediterranean diet, with more fish, one sees lower rates of Parkinson\'s and Alzheimer\'s,"" says Tony Werner, a PhD student in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and lead researcher on the study. This has also been observed in Japan, where seafood forms a central part of the diet. The team is careful to note that no definite links can be established at this point, however.\n\nMore About: Amyloids and Aggregation\n\nProteins are long chains of amino acids that fold into specific structures to carry out their function. But sometimes, proteins can fold incorrectly, and get tangled up with other proteins, a process known as aggregation. As these misfolded proteins aggregate together, they create long fibrous structures known as amyloids. Amyloids are not necessarily a bad thing, but can be responsible for various diseases. Some of them can interfere with neurons in the brain, killing those cells, and causing a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nMore About: The Study\n\nNathalie Scheers had looked at parvalbumin before in another context.\n\n""I was on a previous study where we looked at possible compliance markers for fish intake. Parvalbumin is a cause of fish allergies, so we knew that it passed over to the blood, and that this form of parvalbumin is specific for fish""\n\nShe joined forces with Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, and together they took the idea forward.\n\n""Because Nathalie had previously shown that parvalbumin passes into the body of the person eating fish, it made sense to study its interaction with human proteins. We already knew that they can meet in the gut, the blood, or the brain,"" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede.\n\n###']",The announcement should have made it clear that studies of fish cannot be extrapolated to humans.,"The subtitle of this news release says the Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) study “shines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better long-term neurologic health.”
But this in vitro lab study only suggests that the fish protein, parvalbumin, binds to a particular human protein called “alpha-synuclein” which has been identified as forming amyloid chains in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
The news release should have made it clear that studies of fish cannot be extrapolated to humans, and further, that no cause and effect relationship has been established between amyloid proteins and the development of any neurologic disease.

Clinical trials will need to be conducted to see if the effect researchers have observed is actually due to the meningococcal B vaccine. But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea.\n\nThe last remaining drugs to cure this sexually transmitted infection are showing signs they may only have a few more years of usefulness left.\n\n“While it is still very early days, these findings represent a positive step in the search for a vaccine against this common and distressing disease that is increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment,” said Robin Gaitens, a spokeswoman for GSK, which owns the product that contains this meningitis component.\n\nWhy would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? Some biology is useful here.\n\nMeningitis is a condition — inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord — that can be triggered by some viruses and several types of bacteria.\n\nOne of the latter is Neisseria meningitidis, sometimes known as meningococcal disease. It is the only form of bacterial meningitis that triggers epidemics.\n\nDespite the fact that gonorrhea and meningitis are quite different from one another, the bacteria that cause Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are actually related.\n\nMeningococcal disease is rare but very dangerous. It can kill, and quickly. People who survive the infection can suffer permanent brain damage or may lose one or several limbs.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for The Readout Your daily guide to what’s happening in biotech. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nBecause of the severity of the consequences, health officials often mount emergency vaccination campaigns in response to outbreaks of Neisseria meningitidis.\n\nThere are vaccines for several Neisseria meningitidis strains, but designing a vaccine to protect against the B strain was a particularly difficult nut to crack. As a consequence, the vaccine component that was made to protect against B targets a different part of the bacterium, Petousis-Harris said.\n\nThat may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. Meningococcal vaccines that protect against the other strains do not seem to have the same effect.\n\n“A lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,” Petousis-Harris said. “And what’s happened with gonorrhea? Nothing. Gonorrhea carries on its merry little way.”\n\nNew Zealand had a very bad meningococcal outbreak in the early 2000s caused by the B strain. A special vaccine that only protected against that strain was made; it was used between 2004 and 2008.\n\nPetousis-Harris and her colleagues looked later to see if gonorrhea rates had changed after that meningococcal vaccination campaign. They found people who were vaccinated were 31 percent less likely to be infected with gonorrhea than those who hadn’t received the meningococcal B vaccine.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the Lancet, was funded by GSK and Auckland Uniservices, the commercialization arm of the University of Auckland.\n\nThe single-component vaccine used by New Zealand is no longer made. But the same component is one of several in the Bexsero vaccine, which was used in Quebec when the government decided to vaccinate against meningococcal B disease in a part of the province with a high relative rate of cases a few years ago.\n\nDr. Jean Longtin, head of the province’s public health laboratory, said he and some colleagues decided to look at whether the vaccination campaign was having an impact on gonorrhea rates in that area after reading about an early observation from Norway.\n\n“In Quebec we saw the exact same effect as New Zealand,” said Longtin, who said his group is still analyzing its findings. “Gonorrhea rates have been going down in the vaccine group whereas in the non-vaccine group it’s following the rest of the province.”\n\nIt is not clear how long the protection — if it’s real — will actually last. But even a few years of protection could help significantly reduce the spread of gonorrhea, experts argue.\n\n“Mathematical modeling has shown that even a vaccine of moderate efficacy and duration could have a substantial effect on the transmission and prevalence of gonorrhea, if coverage in the population is high and protection lasts during the highest risk period,” Kate Seib, of Australia’s Institute for Glycomics, wrote in a commentary that accompanied the study.""]","This industry-sponsored study received broad coverage, much of which downplayed the lack of safety and efficacy data while raising an alarm about antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea and neglecting other strategies to combat the disease.","This story reports on a New Zealand study that suggests a vaccine that protects against a strain of meningitis may also offer some protection against gonorrhea. The research, published in the Lancet, estimated that a meningitis B vaccine administered to teens and young adults during an outbreak in the early 2000s was 31 percent effective in protecting against gonorrhea.
The story does a good job of covering the science behind this surprising finding, but its optimistic assertion that the “world might be catching a break when it comes to drug-resistant gonorrhea” seems premature. Also, the potential costs and side effects were not discussed. Excluding the drawbacks plays into the marketing strategy of GlaxoSmithKline, which is pushing to increase sales of its vaccine, Bexsero.

In 2013 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 230,000 were given that diagnosis. Each one very likely came as a devastating blow, both to the patient and to her family.\n\nBut what if some of these cases are preventable? What if there was a medication that could at least reduce a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer?\n\nSuch drugs already exist.\n\nThe Breast Cancer Prevention Trial published results in 1998 indicating that women who took one of those drugs, tamoxifen, were half as likely to develop breast cancer as similar women who did not take the drug.\n\nOther medications, including raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatese inhibitors, do much the same thing, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved aromatese inhibitors for this use. Studies estimate that more than 2 million American women at high risk for breast cancer could benefit from taking a preventive drug.\n\nA carton and individual 20 mg tablets of Tamoxifen, manufactured by Pharmaceutical company Wockhardt UK Ltd.

A small 2014 study in the Journal of Women’s Health found that only 13 percent of internal medicine, family medicine and gynecology physicians reported having recommended or prescribed these medications to women who might benefit from them.\n\nThe “low uptake of these medications is a missed opportunity,” says Heidi Nelson, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. “Many high-risk women . . . could reduce their risks for invasive cancer by approximately 30 to 50 percent.” On the other hand, these drugs don’t suit everyone, and they are not without risks of their own. Because some of the side effects are serious — such as blood clots in the legs and in the lungs, and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer — only women who are deemed to be at high risk for the disease should consider them. But there are conflicting views on who meets that “high risk” definition\n\nA bit about the drugs\n\nChemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. Although both involve taking drugs, chemoprevention medications are taken with the goal of avoiding breast cancer altogether and the subsequent need for chemotherapy later.\n\nAnd they work on the body differently. Chemotherapy kills off cells, healthy ones as well as cancercous ones. The chemoprevention drugs, by contrast, work by blocking estrogen, a hormone known to promote the growth of cancer cells in breast tissue. Chemoprevention drugs are called SERMs, or selective estrogen receptor modulators, and two have been approved specifically for breast cancer prevention: tamoxifen, which was developed to treat breast cancer after its onset and only later was found to have a preventive benefit, and raloxifene, which was designed to treat osteoporosis.\n\nA 2013 study in the Lancet analyzed data for more than 80,000 women taking tamoxifen or other SERM drugs. The researchers found an overall 38 percent reduction in new cases of breast cancer 10 years after women took these drugs compared with women who took a placebo. The effect was even larger during the first five years of the study.\n\nInvestigators working for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of scientists and clinicians funded by the government, echoed these results. After looking at multiple trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene, the task force noted that these drugs reduced new cases of breast cancer significantly: from 23 cases per 1,000 women in the control groups to 16 cases per 1,000 women in the treatment groups.\n\nNelson, one of the lead authors of the analysis, is “confident” that these results show a true benefit. Others are more cautious.\n\nKenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University who worked on developing the task force’s SERM guidelines, notes that while SERMs may have reduced new cases, they “have not been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in any study or meta-analysis.” One possible explanation, he says, is that “these drugs are effective at preventing nonlethal cancers rather than the more serious ones.”\n\nNot used enough?\n\nGiven that these drugs seem to offer some protection, why are they not in widespread use? Serious side effects is one reason. Beyond blood clots and uterine cancer, other known reactions to the drugs include strokes, cataracts, bone pain, hot flashes, nausea and vaginal dryness.\n\nFor some women, the risk of such side effects may be worth taking, depending on their particular odds of developing breast cancer. Those odds can be figured by using a commonly used calculator, often called the Gail model, that estimates a woman’s chances of having breast cancer in a five-year period and over a lifetime.\n\nBut this is where it gets more complicated. While many experts agree that women at high risk should consider the medications, they do not agree on what Gail score should trigger that consideration.\n\nThe studies that served as the basis for the FDA approval of the drugs, along with recently released guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), set the threshold at a five-year Gail score of 1.67 percent.\n\nThe Preventive Services Task Force, however, recommended a threshold of 3 percent. At that point, the panel said, women “are likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene.”\n\nASCO’s lower cutoff worries some experts. “At the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,” Georgetown’s Lin says, “every woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.” That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects.\n\nStarting a conversation\n\nKala Visvanathan, the lead author of the ASCO recommendations and a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the cutoffs provide only a rough estimate of risk.\n\nIt is important to realize, she adds, that “as the risk increases, the benefits tend to be greater. This is an evolving field, and our goal is to better discern who is at high and low risk of breast cancer and develop a greater range of prevention strategies.”\n\nAn individual risk analysis should prompt conversation between doctor and patient about the potential benefits and the risk of the therapy.\n\nBoth the ASCO and the task force guidelines recommend such a conversation. “The discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent,” according to ASCO.\n\nThe task force similarly recommends that “clinicians engage in a shared, informed decision making” with women and said that clinicians “should offer to prescribe” these drugs. Many risk factors increase a woman’s chances of having side effects. These factors include older age, obesity, having a history of a blood clot, history of any cancer, immobility, history of certain autoimmune conditions, history of using estrogen or oral contraceptives and history of some form of heart disease.\n\nInsured women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs, because this treatment was included in the Affordable Care Act as mandated, no-charge preventive care.\n\nSo what should a woman do?\n\nMost important, become familiar with your family history, know your risk factors and discuss them with your primary-care physician. Age and family history cannot be controlled, but lifestyle changes — including eating a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and not overconsuming alcohol — are eminently doable and can reduce your risk. These basic tenets of leading a healthy lifestyle have been shown to be important factors in breast cancer prevention.\n\nVisvanathan and her colleagues are hopeful that more women will be aware of this option.\n\n“A discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,” she says. “We should begin to implement preventive strategies based on what we already know.”\n\nMishori is an associate professor of family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and director of the Health & Media fellowship. Seliby is a family physician and the Health & Media fellow at Georgetown University School of Medicine.']",This is a thorough look at the pros and cons of taking certain drugs that have been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer. The five stars are well deserved.,"Drugs exist to lower the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women, but they aren’t getting used as often as one might expect. This story does an excellent job of exploring the disparity between research showing the drugs’ effectiveness and the lack of real-world use. We especially like that the story includes the perspective of an independent family physician, who raises some concerns about the drugs and their supporting evidence that cancer specialists might be less likely to emphasize.
The story does have some problems that would have been fairly easy to address. Inflated relative risk figures are presented high up in the story, while more useful absolute figures are buried further down. Costs aren’t fully explored. And since the story emphasizes the need for careful patient decision-making about this treatment, we also thought it would have been valuable to interview some actual patients. With existing groups of women who “meet” on social media to discuss breast cancer, it wouldn’t have been much additional work to include the patient perspective.

Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture and cause a blood clot to form on the plaque’s surface. If the blockage isn’t treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. This heart damage may go unrecognized and lead to severe or long-lasting problems.\n\nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a surgical procedure that improves blood flow to the heart by bypassing clogged arteries. CABG was once thought to be too risky for patients with the long-term effects of coronary artery disease: left ventricular dysfunction (when the left side of the heart is unable to pump normally) and heart failure (when the heart can’t pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs). Early studies of the safety and effectiveness of CABG excluded most patients with these conditions. The procedure was typically used to relieve disabling angina, or chest pain.\n\nA team led by Dr. Eric J. Velazquez of Duke University Medical Center conducted a 5-year randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of CABG on patients with coronary artery disease that shows sign of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. More than 1,200 patients were included in the clinical trial. They were randomly assigned to receive either CABG plus medical treatment or medical treatment alone. The medical treatment included guideline-directed medications and devices. Patients had follow-up evaluations every 4 months for the first year and then every subsequent 6 months.\n\nAn extension study evaluated the 10-year outcomes of the surgical intervention. Almost all the participants were included in the 10-year follow-up results. The research was funded by NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Results were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine on April 3, 2016.\n\nDeath from any cause occurred in 359 patients (59%) in the CABG group and in 398 patients (66%) receiving medical treatment alone. A total of 247 patients (41%) in the CABG group and 297 patients (49%) in the medical treatment group died from cardiovascular causes. In addition, the bypass surgery was associated with an overall 1.4-year increase in median survival time (7.7 vs. 6.3 years).\n\nThese results show that CABG improves survival for people with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure.\n\n“The current 10-year follow-up provides new important insights about patient subgroups that are more likely to benefit from CABG as compared to medical therapy alone,” explains NHLBI Director Dr. Gary H. Gibbons. “As such, we now have a solid evidence base to inform patient care and the future development of clinical practice recommendations.”']",This news release delivers good info on heart bypass surgery outcomes but harms and costs were absent.,"This news release describes extended outcomes of a large, randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery plus medical treatment with those of medical treatment alone on patients with dysfunction or failure of their heart’s pumping function. The study showed significantly lower rates of death from any cause (59% vs 66%) and death from a heart or blood vessel-related cause (41% vs 49%) as well as greater median survival (7.7 vs 6.3 years) among those who received CABG and medical treatment compared to those who received medical treatment alone.

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors.\n\n""Until now there were no quick ways to rule out a heart attack within the emergency department,"" explains lead author Dr Anoop Shah from the University of Edinburgh in the UK. ""We have identified a cardiac troponin concentration (less than 5 nanograms per deciliter; <5 ng/L) below which patients are at very low risk of heart attack either during the admission or in the ensuing 30 days. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. These findings could dramatically reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and provide substantial cost savings for healthcare providers.""[2]\n\nOne of the most common causes of hospitalisation worldwide is acute chest pain. In the UK alone, chest pain is responsible for around 1 million visits to the emergency department every year. International guidelines recommend that individuals presenting with chest pain are admitted to hospital for testing for very high levels of troponin (above the 99th percentile)--a sign that a heart attack has occurred. Current approaches for assessing patients with suspected heart attacks either require admission into hospital or lengthy stays in the emergency department for repeat testing. Until now, whether new high-sensitivity cardiac troponin tests could identify very low-risk patients who may be suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department was unknown.\n\nThe test used in this study is more sensitive than the standard version and can detect far lower levels of troponin in the blood. Using this test, troponin levels were measured in over 6000 patients with chest pain admitted to four hospitals in Scotland and the USA. Dr Shah and colleagues prospectively evaluated the negative predictive value (the probability that patients were not at risk) of heart attack or subsequent death from a heart condition after 30 days for a range of troponin concentrations.\n\nThe researchers found that a troponin threshold of <5 ng/L at presentation identified around two-thirds (61%) of patients at very low risk of heart attack and may have been eligible for early, safe discharge--with a high negative predictive value of 99.6%. This high negative predictive value persisted irrespective of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, or prior cardiovascular disease. At one year, these patients had a three times lower risk of heart attack and cardiac death than those who had troponin levels 5 ng/L or higher.\n\nAccording to Dr Shah, ""Over the last two decades the number of hospital admissions due to chest pain has tripled. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. This study shows that low plasma cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation identify up to two-thirds of patients who are at very low risk of heart attack and could be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.""[2]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Louise Cullen and William Parsonage from the Royal Brisbane and Women\'s Hospital, Queensland, Australia, and Martin Than from Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand, say, ""The ultimate validation for the safety and efficacy of discharging patients with cardiac troponin concentrations less than 5 ng/L will be the report of clinical outcomes after this threshold is implemented in routine clinical practice...Finally, what further assessment, if any, is needed for those patients identified as low risk and suitable for early discharge? Trials are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of clinical pathways that involve no further testing for such patients.""\n\n###\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\nThis study was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Chief Scientists Office (Scotland).\n\n[1] A troponin test measures the level of troponin proteins in the blood. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, like during a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin there will be in the blood. Even a slight increase in the troponin level will often mean there has been some damage to the heart. Very high levels of troponin are a sign that a heart attack has occurred.\n\n[2] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.']","A pretty good breakdown on the basics of this study and its implications, but there was room for more context.","This news release describes the results of a study designed to significantly advance the search for a rapid blood test that can rule out evidence of heart muscle damage in people who come to emergency rooms with chest pain and other symptoms of heart attack. The study, reported in the journal The Lancet, specifically offers compelling evidence that a version of a commonly used blood test may indeed further that quest.
For the study, investigators used a highly sensitive version of an existing blood test that detects the protein troponin on more than 6,300 consecutive people presenting to hospital emergency rooms (mostly in Scotland) with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The researchers were able to determine the probability that patients were NOT at risk of heart attack or death from heart attack after 30 days for a range of troponin levels.
The release does a generally adequate job of describing how the high-sensitivity test appears to identify very low levels of troponin, in contrast to current troponin tests, thus making it theoretically possible to accurately, relatively quickly, and safely rule out a heart attack in more than 60 percent of such people, at least over the short term. It covers the fact that conventional troponin testing detects only higher levels of the protein, and must be done on serial blood samples over a longer period of time. And the news release puts appropriate emphasis on the potential the new test has for decreasing unnecessary hospitalizations and reducing health care costs.
All that said, the release could have done a much better job of making clear earlier in the text that substantially more research will be needed to determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of relying heavily on high-sensitivity troponin testing. Although the release uses qualifiers such as “may have been eligible for early safe discharge,” we think more needed to be said about potential risks, about the potential costs of the more sensitive test; and most of all about the limitations of the study and over-reliance on any single test when people experience heart attack symptoms.

But an updated look at the study indicates that heart disease patients who follow this advice may actually increase their risk for death.\n\nThe original ""Sydney Diet Heart Study,"" was initially conducted between 1966 and 1973, at a time when the cholesterol-lowering benefits of all polyunsaturated vegetable acids (PUFAs) were touted with a broad brush.\n\nBut in the ensuing years, researchers have come to understand that not all PUFAs are alike, with key biochemical differences -- and perhaps varying cardiovascular impacts -- observed among multiple types of omega-3s (found in fish oils) and omega-6 linoleic acids.\n\n""There is more than one type of polyunsaturated fatty acid,"" explained Dr. Christopher Ramsden, who headed the re-analysis and is a clinical investigator with the laboratory of membrane biophysics and biochemistry at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\n""And so, we were interested in trying to evaluate just one of these compounds, linoleic acid, by looking at this old trial using modern statistical methods, and also by re-including some original data that had gone missing from the first analysis,"" Ramsden explained.\n\nThe findings appeared online Feb. 5 in the BMJ.\n\nThe 458 male participants in the original study had been between the ages of 30 and 59 at enrollment, and all had a history of heart disease, with most having survived a heart attack.\n\nThe men were placed into two groups. The first group was told to consume linoleic acid, in the form of safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine, at levels equal to 15 percent of total calorie intake. This, said Ramsden, is equivalent to roughly twice the amount that Americans currently consume.\n\nWhile omega-3 consumption was not affected, the men were also asked to lower their saturated fat intake so that it made up less than 10 percent of their diets. They did so by substituting safflower oil for animal fats, common margarines and shortening oils, salad dressings, baked goods and other products, according to the study.\n\nThe second group continued their routine nutritional habits, and both groups kept food diaries and underwent regular assessments during the three-year-plus study period.\n\nBy newly crunching all the original data the NIH team found that, compared to the no-dietary-change group, the linoleic acid group faced a higher risk of death, from both heart disease specifically as well as from all causes overall.\n\nIn turn, Ramsden\'s investigators included their Sydney conclusions in a new review of all studies to date exploring the impact of omega-6 consumption.\n\nDespite the fact the American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that 5 percent to 10 percent of all calories come from polyunsaturated fat (principally from omega-6), the NIH team found no evidence to support the notion that linoleic acid confers health benefits. The review highlighted the possibility that boosting omega-6 consumption may actually increase the risk for developing heart disease.\n\nRamsden acknowledged that the Sydney study had been narrowly focused on a specific group of people: middle-aged men with a history of heart disease, who were asked to consume linoleic acid in quantities far exceeding both AHA guidelines and the dietary habits of most Americans.\n\n""So, yes, one of the limitations of this kind of study is always the question of its generalizability to other populations,"" he cautioned.\n\nBut he also suggested that his team\'s rigorous look back offered valuable insights into how nutritional science has evolved.\n\n""What to many people had at one time seemed pretty straightforward in the 1960s has turned out to form a much less black-and-white picture,"" he said. ""Polyunsaturates are not just involved in cholesterol-lowering. They may also be involved in inflammation, oxidation or clotting. So, it\'s a very complex picture. And though our goal is not to come up with diet advice, it may be that our conclusions will have important implications for nutritional guidelines.""\n\nOn that score, American Heart Association spokesperson Penny Kris-Etherton, a registered dietician and professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, suggested that the controversy concerning linoleic acid is not new and will continue.\n\n""But I don\'t think this is going to change AHA recommendations,"" she said. ""Because there\'s very robust evidence showing the cardiovascular benefit of linoleic acid. The AHA science advisory board did not just look at one study or a couple of studies. There are lots of studies that form the basis for their guidelines.""\n\n""So, I don\'t think anybody should get alarmed and change their diet,"" Kris-Etherton said. ""Those who are concerned should wait for more research to come out on this topic before taking any drastic measures to change their eating habits in a way that could be harmful.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on AHA guidelines regarding linoleic acid, visit the American Heart Association.']","This story attempted to address some complicated nutrition science, but didn’t quite measure up. ","The main strength of the story was an independent perspective from an American Heart Association expert who provided valuable context about the problem of reading too much into the results of a single study. The major weakness was the failure to distinguish between vegetable oils that are almost entirely omega-6 linoleic acid (e.g. corn and safflower oil), about which the study raises significant concerns, and those that have a balance of linoleic acid and omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. canola and soybean oil), about which there is less worry. The treatment of the statistics was also unsatisfactory, as was the explanation of why the results are novel and different from previous research.

Collaboration with Ping Wang, associate professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania\'s Perelman School of Medicine, enabled the design and implementation of the key clinical validation study.\n\nSymptoms, judgment, waiting\n\nIn rural or underserved areas, doctors sometimes must rely on a patient\'s symptoms or use their own judgement in looking at test sample color results to determine whether a patient has an infection. As expected, this process is often inaccurate. If they send results off to a lab in a distant city, the doctors sometimes must wait for days -- by which time the infection may have become widespread. Most existing mobile health diagnostic devices, meanwhile, can only analyze one sample at a time.\n\nSmartphone vs. lab tests\n\nThe WSU researchers found that their portable smartphone reader worked nearly as well as standard lab testing in detecting 12 common viral and bacterial infectious diseases, such as mumps, measles, herpes, and Lyme Disease.

""If we find out about infections, we can treat them more quickly, which makes a difference especially in low-resource, remote areas.""\n\nLow-cost components\n\nBuying the components themselves, the research team was able to build the device for about $50, but the manufacturing cost would probably be lower than that, he said. They have filed a patent and hope to move forward with clinical trials that could lead to commercialization.\n\n###\n\nThe work was supported by a WSU fund to support entrepreneurial endeavors.']",It’s a huge leap from the lab to field use in the real world. This release ignores the many steps and considerations that must be dealt with in between.,"This news release about a smartphone-based infectious disease testing device confuses speed and device cost with benefits to patients and public health. It oversimplifies infectious disease detection and response. In their published study, the researchers reported an important achievement: comparable accuracy (under ideal conditions) with existing lab devices. However, the release doesn’t point out vital distinctions between performance in the lab and in real-world field use, or between the cost of a device and the total cost of a public health program that uses such a device.

1802,story_reviews_00883,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/treating-sleep-apnea-without-the-mask/,2012-04-09 04:00:00,Treating Sleep Apnea Without the Mask,"['About 28 million Americans have sleep apnea, which causes repeated awakenings and pauses in breathing during the night, sometimes resulting in loud snoring and gasps for air. For decades, the standard treatment has been “continuous positive airway pressure.” A mask worn at night pushes air into the nasal passages, enabling easier breathing. C.P.A.P. reduces and in some cases completely prevents episodes of apnea.\n\nJoseph A. Golish M.D.\n\nBut the mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie: big, bulky and obtrusive. Many patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep. Studies show that about half of all people prescribed C.P.A.P. machines stop using them in one to three weeks.\n\n“For a lot of people out there, the C.P.A.P. machine turns into a doorstop,” said Dr. Joseph Golish, the former chief of sleep medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and now a professor with the MetroHealth System in Cleveland. “C.P.A.P. is very effective in the sleep lab. But when people go home, there’s a good chance they won’t use it, and the success rate of an unused C.P.A.P. machine is absolutely zero.”\n\nNow an alternative form of C.P.A.P. is gaining popularity: a patch that fits over the nostrils. Called Provent, the patch holds two small plugs, one for each nostril, that create just enough air pressure to keep the airways open at night. It is far less intrusive than the traditional C.P.A.P. machine. It is also more expensive, and it doesn’t work for every patient.\n\nApproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008, Provent has spread mostly by word of mouth. But it has caught on fast. Its manufacturer, Ventus Medical, says it has shipped one million of the devices in the past 12 months, up from a half million total in the two years prior. Doctors say it has given them a new weapon in the battle against sleep apnea, and many patients who struggled with C.P.A.P. call it a godsend.\n\nBob Bleck, who owns a computer networking firm in Ohio, struggled with poor sleep and chronic fatigue for decades. But it was only a year and a half ago that he finally went to a sleep clinic, prodded by his wife, who worried about his heavy snoring.\n\nThe diagnosis was severe sleep apnea. Tests showed that in a typical night, Mr. Bleck, 47, awoke or stopped breathing 42 times an hour.\n\nHis doctor prescribed a C.P.A.P. machine, and Mr. Bleck hated it.\n\n“I had this constricted feeling,” he said. “It would be incorporated into these dreams where I was tied up, like in the movie ‘Alien.’ It was more difficult to sleep with that thing on than to just get through the night with the apnea.”\n\nMr. Bleck got rid of the machine after he discovered Provent. “After I started using it, I noticed a difference right away,” he said. “My symptoms subsided dramatically.”\n\nProvent works like a traditional C.P.A.P. machine but is only a fraction of the size. When people with apnea fall asleep, their throat muscles collapse, constricting the airway and causing the body to fight for air. C.P.A.P. machines use mild air pressure to keep the airway from constricting.\n\nProvent does too, but in a different way. The device contains two pinhole-size valves, one over each nostril. The valves let air in easily — most people breathe through their nostrils while asleep — but there is resistance as the user exhales. That resistance creates a backpressure in the airways, dilating the muscles that would otherwise collapse in the middle of the night. In the morning, the patch is removed; a new one is used every night.\n\nLast year, in a large study of 250 apnea sufferers published in the medical journal Sleep and subsidized by Ventus, researchers found that those who used Provent devices over a three-month period saw their apnea episodes fall sharply, compared with people who were given a sham, or placebo, device. A follow-up study tracked people over the course of a year and had similar results.\n\nBut not everyone finds that Provent alleviates their apnea. In interviews, sleep specialists said that a third or more of patients do not end up using it.\n\n“It works like a champ in some people and doesn’t work on other people,” said Dr. Nancy Appelblatt, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in Sacramento who has prescribed it to about 100 patients. “All sleep apnea is not created equal.”\n\nSome people, for example, breathe through the mouth at night, not the nostrils. In those people, Provent typically doesn’t work. Nor will it work very well in someone who has severe nasal allergies and has a blocked nose at night, said one of the leaders of the Provent studies, Dr. Meir H. Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School and founder of the National Sleep Foundation.\n\nUnlike C.P.A.P., Provent is not covered by Medicare and most major insurers, though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future. In the meantime, a 30-day supply of the patches costs $65 to $80.\n\nDr. Lee A. Surkin, a cardiologist and sleep medicine specialist in Greenville, N.C., said patients typically start with a 10-day trial pack that costs $27.50. He has prescribed Provent to about 300 of his patients.\n\n“The No. 1 reason people don’t continue it is the out-of-pocket expense,” he said.\n\nFor now, Dr. Kryger and others say that C.P.A.P. will continue to be the gold standard, and certainly the first option for patients with severe apnea.

That makes it much safer than, say, systemic stimulants that also rev up the heart and other parts of the body and cause strong side effects, according to the research. Anyone remember fen-phen?\n\nFor now, the new approach has been demonstrated only in mice, according to the research, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. But Ronald Evans, director of the institute\'s Gene Expression Laboratory and lead author of the new study, said in an interview that if it shows the same promise in primate studies, clinical trials on humans could begin in a couple of years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n""We described a new type of therapy that targets the known genetic switch in our bodies that is linked to eating and metabolic control,"" Evans said. ""The drug or the pill is taken orally, and it tricks the body into thinking you’ve eaten a meal."" Yet the mice showed no reduction in appetite and continued to eat the same amount of food, the study showed.\n\nThe paper suggests that the drug may one day offer a nonsurgical alternative to ""vertical sleeve gastrectomies"" that have become popular in the battle against morbid obesity. More than a third of the U.S. population is considered obese.\n\nNearly 20 years ago, Evans\'s lab worked to identify the molecular switch that turns on a whole series of bodily responses to eating, including digestion, absorption, the transfer of nutrients by the bloodstream and increased blood circulation, to name a few. In mice at least, fexaramine turns on that switch and sets off the same cascade of reactions without any side effects, Evans said.

The drug contributed to development of brown fat, which helps burn calories, and relieves inflammation of cells in various tissues, which is the result of chronic obesity. It also reduced resistance to insulin, the hormone that helps cells absorb the glucose they use for energy. Many Type 2 diabetics become resistant to insulin and have to inject additional amounts.\n\nBut don\'t expect to be popping fexaramine any time soon.

Overall, this story says too much about things that have yet to be tested, and not enough about the hurdles that stand between this experimental drug and clinical approval.

An already approved drug could be quickly available and would then be the first breast cancer prevention drug.\n\nAbout one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Causes can be the use of synthetic sex hormones and other environmental factors, but also gene mutations like in the BRCA1 gene (BReast CAncer). US actress Angelina Jolie who underwent a preventive double mastectomy is the most famous carrier of a „faulty“ BRCA1 gene. On average, women with this mutation have an up to 87% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Tumors usually develop early in life. Until now, prophylactic surgery is the only procedure which significantly reduces the breast cancer risk, but which is also often associated with postoperative complications.\n\nIn 2010, Josef Penninger, the scientific director of IMBA in Vienna and his team have shown that sex hormones can trigger breast cancer (Schramek et al., Nature) through proteins called RANKL and its receptor RANK, which are key factors in bone metabolism. RANKL and RANK also link sex hormones to breast cells by providing signals telling the breast cells to grow. This occurs normally in every woman during pregnancy and the menstruation cycle. However, if deregulated, mammary cells start to divide and multiply and fail to die when they should, ultimately resulting in breast cancer.\n\nA multinational research effort now made the discovery that RANKL is also the main driver of BRCA1 mutation-driven breast cancer. In the current study, Verena Sigl, graduate student from Penninger\'s research group, showed that blocking the RANKL/RANK system in BRCA1 mutant mice led to largely normal mammary glands whereas invasive carcinomas could be found in the control group. To determine the relevance of their results for humans, scientists in Vienna and Toronto isolated breast tissue cells from women who had undergone preventive mastectomy because of their BRCA1 mutation. In the human cell culture, too, RANKL inhibition led to a significant reduction of growth and spreading of breast tissue cells. Moreover, the scientists – together with colleagues in Barcelona and from the CIMBA* consortium mapping more than 23,000 women – showed that genetic variants in the RANK gene are associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer in women who carry BRCA1 and also BRCA2 mutations.\n\n""Our finding is so exciting because there is already an approved drug against RANKL called „Denosumab”. It is an antibody with very few side effects, which binds tightly to RANKL, thereby inhibiting its ability to act. Based on our discovery, the already approved drug Denosumab or other future drugs that will block RANKL/RANK, could be used for breast cancer prevention in BRCA mutation carriers,"" explains Verena Sigl.\n\nScientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have already tried the preventive use of a RANKL blocking drug in mice. Animals carrying BRCA1 mutations were divided into two groups. In the control group multiple early breast cancer lesions developed. The second group received RANKL blockade treatment for prevention with the result that virtually no malignant changes in breast tissue could be observed even over a longer period of observation.\n\nCareful phase III clinical trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy in humans. Thereafter, any woman who has been tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation could take RANKL blockade as prevention measure to reduce her dramatically increased breast cancer risk. Josef Penninger adds: “This work is a great example of an international collaboration of many scientists with one grand vision: Prevention of breast cancer. Cancer prevention is one of the key issues we face in medicine today, a world where much fewer women will get breast cancer in the first place. We have also shown that RANKL/RANK are critically involved in sex hormone-driven breast cancer. If the uncovered mechanism indeed works in the prevention of breast cancer in high risk patients, this could possibly be used to prevent breast cancer in general. One door for breast cancer prevention has now been opened and this can be tested very fast.”\n\nThe present work is the result of international collaboration. Scientists from Austria (IMBA, AKH Wien) participated as well as researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, Baltimore, USA; Toronto, Canada and Barcelona, Spain. See original publication for details.\n\n*CIMBA: http://www.apps.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/consortia/cimba/\n\nJosef Penninger’s studies at IMBA are largely supported by the 7.4 million US $ ""Innovator Award"" through the ""US Department of Defense”.']","Everyone is interested in cancer prevention discoveries, but alarm bells go off when we see findings from studies in mice and Petri dishes applied to humans.","This news release covers new published research around the use of a drug — denosumab — as a preventative treatment for those women who might have a genetic disposition to a certain type of breast cancer, those who carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. While this multinational research news release presents the discovery as hopeful and exciting, the leap from rodent studies to humans is likely long, tenuous and far from certain. The news release treats the benefits and evidence found in the research somewhat vaguely, but over-reaches in describing the potential application of denosumab in preventing breast cancer. The release also claims that denosumab would be the first drug for preventing breast cancer, but Tamoxifen and raloxifene have already been approved for reducing breast cancer risk.

On Thursday, an FDA advisory panel is expected to review Qnexa, made by Vivus, from a combination of phentermine and topiramate. It helped patients in clinical trials lose as much as 13 percent to 15 percent of body weight.\n\nFDA briefing documents posted online Tuesday acknowledged Qnexa\'s effectiveness in helping patients lose weight, but said the review panel should take into account a number of potential nervous system and psychiatric side effects, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe third new drug is Orexigen Therapeutic\'s Contrave, which is a combination of the antidepressant Wellbutrin and the addiction drug naltrexone.\n\nFor the lorcaserin study, Smith\'s team randomly assigned 3,182 obese or overweight people to lorcaserin or placebo. Patients took lorcaserin twice a day for a year and also took part in diet and exercise counseling.\n\nAfter one year, 47.5 percent of those taking lorcaserin had lost 5 percent or more of their body weight. ""That\'s about 20 pounds,"" Smith said.\n\nAmong those taking the placebo, only 20.3 percent had achieved that amount of weight loss, the researchers found.\n\nAfter the first year, people taking lorcaserin were randomized to lorcaserin or placebo for an additional year. Among people who stayed on lorcaserin, 67.9 percent were able to maintain the weight loss they had seen in the first year. Among those who were switched to a placebo, 50.3 percent were able to maintain their weight loss, Smith\'s group reported.\n\nSmith\'s team noted that for those taking lorcaserin, there was no increase in heart valve problems as had been seen with the discredited diet drug Fen-Phen. However, common side effects included headache, dizziness and nausea.\n\nDr. Arne Astrup, from the department of human nutrition at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that ""the trial on lorcaserin provides evidence of a safe weight-loss medication, that seems to provide benefits in terms of reducing risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.""\n\nAlso, it does not have the same problems as the previous weight-loss drugs, Fen-Phen (Phentermine), Acomplia (rimonabant) or Meridia (sibutramine), which had been associated with heart problems, he said.\n\n""If weight-loss drugs are tailor-made to hit only the right receptor, based on physiological knowledge, it seems to be possible to develop weight-loss medications that do not possess any serious adverse effects,"" Astrup added.\n\nHowever, one expert was not sold on this new drug.\n\n""What\'s most impressive about this two-year clinical trial is how unimpressive it is,"" said Dr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nNearly half of the people dropped out in the first year, he pointed out, and by year two, more than half the remainder had also dropped out.\n\n""Among those who remained, lorcaserin produced relatively modest weight loss when combined with diet and exercise counseling, and that weight loss was maintained in over half of the participants only so long as they kept taking the drug. And the paper made no mention of the costs attached to long-term pharmacotherapy,"" Katz added.\n\n""This close look at lorcaserin reaffirms that better daily use of feet and forks holds far greater promise for meaningful, sustainable and affordable weight control than pharmacotherapy,"" Katz said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, lorcaserin will be reviewed by an FDA panel in September, and Contrave will be reviewed in December.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on losing weight, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","This is the best of the three stories reviewed on lorcaserin, but it’s not without flaw.

Newsweek’s coverage points out possible selection bias of study participants,"['An emerging treatment for a common hospital-acquired infection could be (slightly) less gross in the future. Researchers have found that delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in a pill—a poop pill, basically—is no worse than a similar procedure done with a colonoscopy.\n\nNeither option may sound particularly enticing, but FMTs are wildly effective at treating a very nasty infection called Clostridium difficile. One of the first controlled clinical trials for FMTs in 2013 ended early because the patients who received the treatment were doing so much better than patients who didn’t. In the new study, almost 90 percent of adults treated with the capsules were cured.\n\n“It’s absolutely insane. We just don’t see kind of efficacy with drugs,” Dr. Dina Kao told Newsweek. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Kao and her colleagues published the findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nC. difficile infections can set in after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can wipe out some of the bacterial populations normally found in people’s gut. The transplants work by replacing those “healthy” bacteria. “C. difficile is the single biggest cause of diarrhea in a health care setting,” Kao said. “It is our public enemy No. 1 in hospitals.”\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, C. difficile infects half a million people in the United States per year and kills 15,000 people. But patients may be hesitant to accept this potentially life-saving treatment because there are feces involved. Previous research found that while every part of this treatment was unappealing to most people, being offered the treatment in a pill form made patients significantly more open to the idea. Other efforts to take the “poop” out of the poop pills—to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits—have failed.\n\nREUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nThe 116 patients used in this study may have been selected in part because they were ideal candidates for FMTs, Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann noted, but she said the paper is solid overall. (Hohmann, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who has also done research on FMTs, was not involved in his research.) “The results are sort of a best-case scenario,” she said. “What I like about this paper is that it validates the upper-GI route and demonstrates that you can get very good cure rates without doing a colonoscopy.”\n\nThat’s important because colonoscopies and the anesthesia required for the procedure can put a lot of stress on a person’s body and can be complicated for the people most at risk for C. difficile infections, Hohmann noted\n\nKao’s study also showed that people found FMTs far less unpleasant when the poop came in a pill. Two-thirds of the 57 patients who got the pills said their experiences were “not at all unpleasant,” while just 44 percent of the 59 patients who received the FMT via a colonoscopy could say the same.\n\nBut most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.\n\nFMTs are not yet common practice, though Kao noted that it is becoming the standard of care for C. difficile infections. “For this group of patients, nothing else really works,” she said. However, the same cannot be said yet for other conditions. While the FDA said in 2013 that doctors can try fecal transplants in patients with C. difficile infections, the agency noted doctors should only use FMT for other conditions in clinical trials. Over 100 clinical trials are ongoing for various FMT therapies, including ones to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease in children. (New FDA guidelines have been in the works since 2016 but aren’t finalized.)\n\nDespite the FDA’s advice, some people have set up shop as FMT providers anyway. Buzzfeed reported in June that one clinic in Tampa was even providing FMTs as a treatment for autism.\n\nThough physicians think they know how FMTs work, it remains somewhat mysterious. One recent, small study found that even stool samples that are entirely free of bacteria can be effective, perhaps because there are non-bacterial organisms that also help.\n\n“We still don’t understand what’s going on, and in these other conditions it’s not as clear-cut that the disturbance in the bacterial composition is the cause,” Kao said. “Stool is such a complex mixture.”']","However, the story should have avoided using the word “cure” in the headline, since we don’t know the long-term results yet.","This Newsweek story reports on the results of a small study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study compared two methods of delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), via a colonoscopy or with an oral pill, to treat Clostridium difficile infection. An FMT involves taking feces from a healthy person and transplanting it into a sick person, to see if that can help eradicate unwanted microbes.
Both approaches were equally successful and the oral pill — as might be expected — was perceived as less objectionable by patients. The story covers most of the bases we require, though it was unclear on the availability of the pill-based treatment, and what role standard antibiotics play in treatment and research outcomes.

Like every new study of prostate cancer, the results need to be carefully parsed.\n\nFirst, the study results, which appear in this week\'s New England Journal of Medicine. It\'s actually an update of a 2008 report, with an additional three years of data on the nearly 700 men who volunteered for the trial up to 15 years ago. All of them had early-stage prostate cancer at the beginning.\n\nThe study found 38 percent fewer prostate cancer deaths among men randomly assigned to the surgery group versus those in what the Swedes called the watchful-waiting group. Men who had surgery had 41 percent lower risk of their cancer spreading throughout the body, and 66 percent less risk of growth within the prostate.\n\nThe survival benefits were restricted to men under 65. For this group, surgery saved one life for every seven men who had prostatectomies — considered a favorable ratio. And it applied to men with tumors considered low-risk, meaning they have a relatively low Gleason score, a marker of tumor aggressiveness.\n\n""Our findings show that some tumors that are considered to be low-risk at diagnosis do pose a threat to life, especially if they are not surgically removed,"" the study authors write.\n\nSo is this a slam-dunk for radical prostatectomy? Game over?\n\nFar from it. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Dr. Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Hospital makes some important points.\n\nFirst, only about 1 in 20 men in the Swedish study had a prostate cancer diagnosis based on a high PSA level. Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. But in the U.S., most prostate cancers are identified by PSA screening, and less than half have palpable tumors.\n\nThis is important, because experts believe many prostate tumors found by PSA are likely to be slow-growing — perhaps so slow they will never cause a problem before the man dies of something else.\n\nSo ""low risk"" in the Swedish study means higher-risk than the current ""low risk"" men diagnosed in the United States. By the way, 9 out of 10 prostate cancers in the U.S. these days is considered low risk.\n\nSecond, the Swedish study compared radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting. And Smith points out that ""watchful waiting"" does not mean the same thing as ""active surveillance.""\n\n""Watchful waiting means we\'re not going to treat you now and if you progress clinically, we\'ll treat you with hormone therapy – not with curative intent,"" Smith tells Shots.\n\n""Active surveillance means observing the patient in a proactive way, with regularly scheduled biopsies,"" he adds. If there\'s a sign the cancer is progressing, doctors currently would treat with intent to cure, using surgery, radiation or both.\n\nSmith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there\'s reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the ""watchful waiting"" group in the newly published study.\n\nUnfortunately, there haven\'t been any large studies in which prostatectomy and radiation therapy have been compared in patients with early-stage prostate cancer who have been randomly assigned to one or the other.\n\nTwo such studies are underway. Results are some years off. But Smith warns against assuming those results will settle the question of how men with early-stage prostate cancer should be treated.\n\n""There will always be questions, and an ongoing need to individualize therapy,"" he says.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This relatively short blog piece contains a lot of critical pieces of information and caveats such as “don’t leap to any conclusions” about this study</span>","Great ending quote from an independent expert about how “there will always be questions, and an ongoing need to individualize therapy.” The story could have mentioned shared decision making as a solution here when men and their doctors are looking to “individualize” the care.
We especially appreciate how the story was “framed” right out of the box when it stated: “Don’t leap to any conclusions. Like every new study of prostate cancer, the results need to be carefully parsed”.

Night milk significantly decreased the rodents’ physical activity, balance and coordination and increased sleep time compared with day milk, the research showed.\n\nMice fed night milk were more inclined to explore open spaces, an indication of reduced anxiety that was comparable to the effects from consuming diazepam, a drug commonly used to treat anxiety in people, the researchers said.\n\nNight milk is rich in tryptophan, a sleep-inducing compound, and melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, the study said. Researchers in South Korea gave lab mice varying doses of dried milk powder made from cow’s milk collected during the day or night and mixed with distilled water. Analysis of the powders showed the night milk contained 24% more tryptophan and nearly 10 times as much melatonin as the day milk. Two groups of control mice received either injections of diazepam or plain drinking water. The mice underwent a series of tests about an hour after treatments. Mice that got night milk were significantly less active than either the mice fed day milk or water-fed controls. Diazepam-treated mice were the least active. Balance and coordination were measured by the number of falls from a rotating bar during a 20-minute period: Mice fed night milk on average fell four to five times, about twice as often as mice given day milk. Diazepam-treated controls fell about nine times, while the water-fed controls fell twice.

Nor is it ever directly compared against diapezam.

The results of the pre-specified subgroup analysis within the ACTIVE clinical trial will be presented Friday, April 1, at ENDO 2016, the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, in Boston.\n\nAccording to lead study author Felicia Cosman, MD, osteoporosis specialist and Medical Director of the Clinical Research Center at Helen Hayes Hospital, Senior Clinical Director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation and Professor of Medicine at Columbia University, who is a consultant to Radius Health, Inc., in Waltham, Massachusetts, ""Abaloparatide-SC increased bone mineral density in both the spine and hip and reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures consistently in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis regardless of their baseline patient characteristics, including age, bone mineral density, and whether or not they had prior fractures.""\n\nThe researchers investigated patients enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, comparative, multicenter international phase 3 ACTIVE trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC in preventing fractures in otherwise healthy, ambulatory, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was defined broadly, using both BMD criteria as well as recent history of nonvertebral fracture and confirmed prevalent vertebral fracture on x-ray. Overall, 2,463 patients between 49 and 86 years of age were randomized to one of three treatment arms for 18 months: double-blind 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC, blind-matched placebo, or open-label 20 micrograms of subcutaneous teriparatide (an FDA-approved prescription drug known to increase bone density and strength).\n\nAt 18 months, abaloparatide-SC significantly increased bone mineral density from baseline at the lumbar spine by 9.2%, the total hip by 3.4% and the femoral neck by 2.9%, compared with placebo. Abaloparatide-SC also reduced new vertebral fractures by 86%, nonvertebral fractures by 43%, clinical fractures by 43%, and major osteoporotic fractures by 70% compared with placebo after 18 months of treatment. The drug also reduced major osteoporotic fractures by 55% compared with teriparatide and increased bone density to a greater extent in the hip region compared with teriparatide.\n\nThe authors found that the risk of new vertebral or nonvertebral fractures dropped consistently among the participants taking abaloparatide-SC, irrespective of their baseline risk factors; and they found an increase in bone mineral density by abaloparatide in each of the baseline risk subgroups.\n\nThe data suggest that abaloparatide appears to be an effective treatment for a broad group of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\n\nThe study was funded by Radius Health, Inc.\n\n###\n\nEndocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers.

It began years ago, when a gastroenterology surgeon approached parasitologist Alex Loukas, one of the senior authors on the new study. The doctor wanted to know whether there might be a connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“If you look at the data that comes in from immunological studies . . . where you remove the parasites [that's] where you see the highest incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies,” said Severine Navarro, the paper's lead author and a senior research fellow in Loukas's lab at James Cook University in Australia.\n\nMany parasites have evolved the ability to hide from their host's immune systems. When a hookworm crawls into a human, it secretes chemicals that turn off the immune alarm bells and repair the tissue around it. It limits its consumption of blood to a few drops a day and doesn't leave its offspring scattered all over its host's gut. (Instead, it thoughtfully plants them in the host's poop to ensure an orderly exit from the body.) Like a very conscientious cat burglar, the hookworm knows it's best served by not making a mess.\n\n“It's almost symbiotic,” Navarro said, “because in order for it to survive and thrive, it needs its host to be happy and healthy.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the adaptations that help the parasites stay hidden also benefit their host by reining in overactive immune systems.\n\nThinking that they might be onto something, the researchers found 12 adults with celiac disease — a serious genetic disorder that causes an autoimmune response to gluten — who volunteered to have doctors infect them with a slimy, slithery hookworm. It was important that the participants be adults, because even relatively benign parasites can cause serious problems for children, pregnant women and others. Navarro also warned people with autoimmune disorders that they should not attempt to infect themselves with a hookworm, no matter how debilitating their illness might be. Parasites are no joke.\n\nFor the dozen trial participants, the hookworm did improve their tolerance of gluten.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was an intriguing result, but it's difficult to scale that kind of study. Only so many people are willing to have a parasite put inside them for science. And because of the risks associated with parasites, going around infecting people isn't a viable treatment option.\n\nSo Navarro and her colleagues isolated the active ingredient in hookworm spit — a compound called AIP-2 — and injected it into asthmatic mice on a daily basis for five days. The animals' asthma systems substantially declined, and their airways became measurably less inflamed. These benefits persisted for 10 weeks after the mice stopped getting the treatment — “I don't even know how much that is in mouse years,” Navarro said.\n\nThe researchers also noticed that AIP-2 seemed to have a calming effect on the body's dendritic cells — a part of the immune system responsible for processing threats.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“It is basically rewiring the cells in that tissue into promoting very efficient regulatory T cells,” Navarro said, describing the cells that help modulate the immune system.\n\nThis suggests that AIP-2 might also help humans, since dendritic cells have the same function in us that they do in mice. Navarro said their next step is a phase one clinical trial, which would test the effectiveness of an AIP-2 pill.\n\nShould that work, it has the potential to help the 235 million people around the world who suffer from asthma. The compound might also be used to treat other autoimmune disorders, like celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.\n\nAD\n\nThis study would also suggest that humans lost something when we rid ourselves of the microbes and parasites that had evolved alongside us for tens of thousands of years. “There’s a major school of thought that says that these parasites should be encountered early in life to contribute to the education of the immune system,” Navarro said.\n\nAD\n\nShe wouldn't go so far as to call parasites good. Deworming campaigns and other public health efforts unquestionably have protected countless people from anemia, malnutrition, developmental disorders and potentially deadly infections.\n\n“But what we need is to find what's good in them,” she said, “and try to restore that missing component.”\n\nRead more:\n\nAD""]",This article is careful to convey the message that ingesting parasites on your own is not safe. What it doesn’t do is to provide a balanced picture of what the results of this study mean.,"Credit: The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences
This story reports on a group of researchers who have derived a compound from hookworm spit that they have tested with some success as a treatment for asthmatic mice. Scientists have observed for several years now that rates of autoimmune disorders and allergies are lower in some low-income nations. The idea is that hygienic practices in high-income nations may have robbed people’s immune systems of natural checks provided by parasites or other microorganisms in their environments. The result, according to this theory, is higher rates of diseases like asthma, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. The researchers quoted in this article first tried infecting patients with celiac disease with live hookworms, then in a more recent study synthesized a compound from hookworm spit for the mouse experiment.
The problem is that the article overstates the potential benefits of a treatment that has not yet been tested in humans (a problem we see fairly often in news stories). Given that limitation, we would expect the story would at least provide testimony by independent experts who could weigh in on whether this new finding is important or not, but it doesn’t. The results of existing and ongoing research on the same topic are mixed at this point, but the article doesn’t say so. In sum, this story doesn’t give readers to tools to assess either quality or impact of the research described.

Scott Turner, MD, PhD, director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University Medical Center. Turner, who treats patients at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, cautions that the findings cannot be used to recommend resveratrol. ""This is a single, small study with findings that call for further research to interpret properly.""\n\nThe resveratrol clinical trial was a randomized, phase II, placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer\'s disease. An ""investigational new drug"" application was required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to test the pure synthetic (pharmaceutical-grade) resveratrol in the study. It is not available commercially in this form.\n\nThe study enrolled 119 participants. The highest dose of resveratrol tested was one gram by mouth twice daily -- equivalent to the amount found in about 1,000 bottles of red wine.\n\nJohn Bozza, 80, participated in the study. Five years ago, his wife, Diana, began noticing ""something wasn\'t quite right."" He was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, but only a year later, his condition progressed to mild Alzheimer\'s.\n\nDiana, whose twin sister died from the same disease, says there are multiple reasons she and John decided to participate in the resveratrol study, and they now know he was assigned to take the active drug.\n\n""I definitely want the medical community to find a cure,"" she says. ""And of course I thought there\'s always a chance that John could have been helped, and who knows, maybe he was.""\n\nPatients, like John, who were treated with increasing doses of resveratrol over 12 months showed little or no change in amyloid-beta40 (Abeta40) levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. In contrast, those taking a placebo had a decrease in the levels of Abeta40 compared with their levels at the beginning of the study.\n\n""A decrease in Abeta40 is seen as dementia worsens and Alzheimer\'s disease progresses; still, we can\'t conclude from this study that the effects of resveratrol treatment are beneficial,"" Turner explains. ""It does appear that resveratrol was able to penetrate the blood brain barrier, which is an important observation. Resveratrol was measured in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid.""\n\nThe researchers studied resveratrol because it activates proteins called sirtuins, the same proteins activated by caloric restriction. The biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer\'s is aging, and studies with animals found that most age-related diseases--including Alzheimer\'s--can be prevented or delayed by long-term caloric restriction (consuming two-thirds the normal caloric intake).\n\nTurner says the study also found that resveratrol was safe and well tolerated. The most common side effects experienced by participants were gastrointestinal-related, including nausea and diarrhea. Also, patients taking resveratrol experienced weight loss while those on placebo gained weight.\n\nOne outcome in particular was confounding, Turner notes. The researchers obtained brain MRI scans on participants before and after the study, and found that resveratrol-treated patients lost more brain volume than the placebo-treated group.\n\n""We\'re not sure how to interpret this finding. A similar decrease in brain volume was found with some anti-amyloid immunotherapy trials,"" Turner adds. A working hypothesis is that the treatments may reduce inflammation (or brain swelling) found with Alzheimer\'s.\n\nThe study, funded by the National Institute on Aging and conducted with the Alzheimer\'s Disease Cooperative Study, began in 2012 and ended in 2014. GUMC was one of 21 participating medical centers across the U.S.\n\nFurther studies, including analysis of frozen blood and cerebrospinal fluid taken from patients, are underway to test possible drug mechanisms.\n\n""Given safety and positive trends toward effectiveness in this phase 2 study, a larger phase 3 study is warranted to test whether resveratrol is effective for individuals with Alzheimer\'s -- or at risk for Alzheimer\'s,"" Turner says.\n\nResveratrol and similar compounds are being tested in many age-related disorders including cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. The study Turner led, however, is the largest, longest and highest dose trial of resveratrol in humans to date.\n\n###\n\nThe research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging (U01 AG010483). Turner reports no personal financial interests related to the study. About Georgetown University Medical Center\n\nGeorgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) is an internationally recognized academic medical center with a three-part mission of research, teaching and patient care (through MedStar Health). GUMC\'s mission is carried out with a strong emphasis on public service and a dedication to the Catholic, Jesuit principle of cura personalis -- or ""care of the whole person."" The Medical Center includes the School of Medicine and the School of Nursing & Health Studies, both nationally ranked; Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, designated as a comprehensive cancer center by the National Cancer Institute; and the Biomedical Graduate Research Organization, which accounts for the majority of externally funded research at GUMC including a Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Institutes of Health.']","Overall, this was a solid news release for a recent phase II trial studying resveratrol and an example for other institutions announcing findings from preliminary studies.","Resveratrol is an antioxidant compound found in grapes and red wine.
This news release from Georgetown University Medical Center does a thorough job laying out the main points of a resveratrol phase II clinical trial. It reasonably talks about the study’s findings and design, while cautioning readers on how researchers must pursue further studies before recommending the drug.
Given this cautious overall framing, we view the release’s omissions as relatively minor. One concern is that the release could have put the potential benefits and the harms into better perspective. For example, readers aren’t told how much levels of the biomarker (Abeta40) would normally decrease in Alzheimer’s patients and how this compares to what was found in the study. Readers also don’t know how many patients suffered from side effects from the concentrated supplement. It would also be interesting to know what existing Alzheimer’s drugs already on the market can do and how resveratrol might compare.
But for the most part, this news release – including its use of language – was appropriately tempered and very informative, hitting home the message that these research findings are preliminary.
Note: We also looked at how this study was covered by Time magazine and CNN, and compared the framing of the results in this news release vs. the subsequent stories.

However, one drug, aflibercept, provided greater improvement for people with more severe vision loss when treatment was initiated. The trial was conducted by the National Eye Institute Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) including researchers from Joslin Diabetes Center. The results appeared in the February online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDiabetes is a significant risk factor for developing eye diseases. The most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness is diabetic retinopathy, which is caused by elevated blood sugar levels damaging the blood vessels of the retina and affects approximately 7.7 million Americans. About 750,000 Americans with diabetic retinopathy have diabetic macular edema (DME) in which fluid leaks into the macula, the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The fluid causes the macula to swell, blurring vision. “DME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in working-age adults with diabetes. With the rate of diabetes increasing dramatically worldwide, many individuals will be at risk for vision loss from diabetic eye complications and DME is a major global health concern,” says Jennifer K. Sun, M.D., M.P.H., a member of the study research team and writing committee, and an Investigator in the Section on Vascular Biology, an ophthalmologist in Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin and an Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nIn an earlier study, Joslin researchers reported that VEGF, a major growth factor for blood vessels, is elevated in the eye fluids of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and DME, causing leakage and the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Over the past few years, drugs that target VEGF have become a standard treatment for DME, providing a preferred alternative or adjunct to laser treatment. The standard Medicare per-injection costs of the three anti-VEGF drugs evaluated in the study are about $1960 for aflibercept (Eylea), $1200 for ranibizumab (Lucentis) and $70 for bevacizumab (Avastin).\n\nAt the start of the trial, 660 adults with DME were enrolled: their average age was 61 years and 90 percent had type 2 diabetes. About half of the participants had 20/32 or 20/40 vision and the other half had vision of 20/50 or worse. They were randomized into three treatment groups and received the assigned study drug by injection into the eye until the DME resolved or stabilized. Participants on bevacizumab and ranibizumab received, on average, 10 injections, versus nine for those on aflibercept.\n\nOne year after starting treatment, all participants had improved vision. Those with mild vision loss (20/32 to 20/40) at baseline in all three treatment groups gained on average almost two lines on an eye chart. For participants with more severe vision loss (20/50 or worse), aflibercept improved vision on average nearly four lines, bevacizumab about 2.5 lines, and ranibizumab almost three lines.\n\n“The results clearly remove any doubts about anti-VEGF drugs’ efficacy in treating DME. All three drugs improved vision substantially, with aflibercept showing more visual gains in patients with worse vision at the start of the trial. Physicians now have robust data to help them counsel patients and make informed decisions regarding treatment options,” says study co-author Lloyd P. Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, Director of Joslin’s Beetham Eye Institute, co-head of Joslin's Section of Vascular Cell Biology, and founding chair of the DRCR Network.\n\nIn light of these positive results, “it is more important than ever for patients with diabetes to be evaluated on a regular basis for eye disease and receive treatment promptly once indicated as we now have excellent success in treating patients with DME,” says Dr. Aiello.\n\nThe trial was supported through a cooperative agreement from the National Eye Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Regeneron Pharmaceutical provided the aflibercept and Genentech provided the ranibizumab for the study. The DRCR.net had complete control over the design of the study, data ownership and content of presentations and publications related to this study.\n\nAbout Joslin Diabetes Center\n\nJoslin Diabetes Center, based in Boston, Massachusetts, undertakes diabetes research, clinical care, education and health and wellness programs on a global scale.

But tests of muscle tissue in mice with a normal SIRT1 gene that were given resveratrol found that the substance boosted mitochondrial function.\n\nMitochondria provide the energy that cells need to function. A decrease in mitochondrial energy production has been linked to a variety of diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer\'s disease, as well as to the aging process itself, said senior study author David Sinclair, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nBut don\'t go reaching for that Chianti yet. Yes, resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes. But ""the amounts we gave to our mice would be like drinking 100 glasses of red wine a day,"" Sinclair said.\n\nInstead, the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate SIRT1 and could be taken as medication. ""My colleagues are in the middle of developing better molecules that we hope will be medicines that will be used to treat diseases of aging, not to extend lifespan, though that may be a side effect,"" Sinclair said.\n\nThe study is in the May 1 issue of Cell Metabolism.\n\nWhile previous studies have also suggested that resveratrol may have anti-aging properties, the precise mechanism of resveratrol has been controversial. Several studies, including work with yeast, worms and flies, have found that resveratrol acts on a class of seven genes known as sirtuins and, in human cells, SIRT1 in particular.\n\nBut other researchers have argued that resveratrol may work by activating a separate energy pathway called AMPK, which is also related to mitochondrial energy production but does not involve sirtuin genes.\n\nTesting the effect of resveratrol on SIRT1 in mice was difficult, Sinclair said. Mice that have their SIRT1 gene deleted are born with developmental defects and are unsuitable for experiments, he explained.\n\nSo Sinclair and two graduate students, Nathan Price and Ana Gomes, worked for years to come up with a method for knocking out SIRT1 in healthy adult mice.\n\n""Our paper found you absolutely require the SIRT1 gene for resveratrol to improve the metabolism of the mice,"" Sinclair said.\n\nThe paper also showed that the AMPK pathway was activated in mice given high doses of resveratrol, yet there was no benefit to mitochondrial function. There was no effect on AMPK in mice given a lower dose of resveratrol.\n\nSinclair is co-founder and a consultant for Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing resveratrol-like molecules for use as treatment for age-related diseases. In 2010, according to news reports, the company, which is owned by GlaxoSmithKline, halted clinical trials of resveratrol, but Sinclair said the company continues to develop improved synthetic molecules.\n\nGeorge Vlasuk, CEO of Sirtris, said the new findings offer the ""first definitive evidence"" for a direct link between SIRT1 and the metabolic benefits of resveratrol.\n\n""The work by [first author] Price et al. strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at Sirtris, which focuses on the development of small-molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging,"" Vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal.\n\nPhilippe Marambaud, an investigator at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Research in Alzheimer\'s Disease and Memory Disorders at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y, said the new research adds to a body of evidence that resveratrol can potentially combat aging by boosting mitochondrial activity.\n\n""In this study, by using an elegant adult-inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse model, the authors now provide compelling evidence that SIRT1 is required in vivo [in the animal] for the effect of resveratrol on AMPK activation and on mitochondrial function,"" Marambaud said.\n\nWhile studies involving animals can be useful, they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans.\n\n""A mouse model is not a human being, especially when you are genetically manipulating this animal model, you want to be very careful,"" Marambaud said. ""This field has been extremely controversial. We should be very careful about claiming the importance of resveratrol for medical purposes. We have to wait and see, but this study is a big step forward.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on healthy aging.']",This story seems determined to pump life into the resveratrol legend – with a sensational headline and a lack of details about why a 2010 trial was halted. Are we really down to reporting on improved mitochondrial function in mice for a consumer audience?,"But when you turn over 90% of a story to a researcher who is a co-founder of and consultant for a company working on a drug and then quote the CEO of that company as well, it’s no surprise that you get a rosy projection.

Not surprisingly, it is also detrimental to mental health.\n\nThree decades of research has shown cognitive behavioral therapy to be equally effective to a pill for insomnia, with fewer side effects. Yet the time and resource-intense strategy — usually involving between six- and eight hour-long appointments with a clinical psychologist - is not widely available and its cost, generally hundreds of dollars, is prohibitive for many.\n\nBuysse and his colleagues wondered if the pill-free treatment could be shortened and simplified, providing more rapid results at a lower cost.\n\nTo find out, they studied 79 adults with chronic insomnia. Participants averaged 72 years of age and were randomly assigned to receive either printed educational material about sleep or the brief behavioral treatment consisting of one 45- to 60-minute in-person session, a 30-minute follow-up session and two 20-minute phone calls.\n\nA mental health nurse practitioner in a regular doctor’s office focused the behavioral instruction on how to restrict time in bed and set regular sleep-wake schedules, while also discussing the biological rationale behind the strategy, including the body’s daily cycles of physical, mental and behavioral changes.\n\n“This (therapy) has the effect of compressing your sleep into a more solid block,” Buysse told Reuters Health in an e-mail. “More consolidated sleep is more refreshing.”\n\nBased on questionnaires and sleep diaries, the researchers found that two out of every three participants receiving the behavioral intervention responded favorably by the end of 4 weeks, while just one out of every four receiving the printed material experienced substantial improvement in their sleep.\n\nThe gap was similarly wide when the researchers looked at the number of participants who no longer met the criteria for insomnia: 55 percent versus 13 percent.\n\nOn average, for every 2.4 participants treated, one responded favorably and one overcame insomnia, report the researchers in the Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nThese improvements were sustained for at least 6 months, and were backed up by data from a sleep monitor worn on the wrist or ankle. When the researchers looked at information from a different, more in-depth sleep monitoring system, however, they failed to find significantly better outcomes with the behavioral therapy.\n\nThe new results were similar to those previously published on the more intense cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n“A lot of insomniacs spend a lot of time lying in bed worrying about their sleep, among other things. They expect to have insomnia,” Dr. Thomas Neylan of the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying commentary in the journal, told Reuters Health.\n\n“Generally, the most expedient thing to do is just prescribe a sleeping pill,” noted Neylan.\n\nBut the drugs can pose problems, ranging from dependence or abuse to cognitive impairment during the day. And the risks may be even more pronounced among older patients, added senior author Timothy Monk, also of the University of Pittsburgh. Under the influence of the drugs, seniors may be more likely to fall and fracture a bone.\n\nWhile brief behavioral treatment for insomnia is not yet generally available, Monk told Reuters Health in an e-mail that his team hopes their findings will be “an important first step in that process.”\n\nIn the meantime, Neylan offers insomniacs some advice: “If you’re not ready to fall asleep, don’t lie down in bed and try to force yourself to sleep. And if you wake up in the middle of night and don’t fall back asleep easily, get out of bed.”\n\n“You don’t want to have any linkage between the experience of lying in bed and being awake,” he said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/fO01ME Archives of Internal Medicine, online January 24, 2011.']",A generally well done report on a very preliminary study.  We would only have hoped for a few more caveats.,"



There is a lot to like about the possibility of a treatment for insomnia that doesn’t rely on sleeping pills or intense and expensive counseling by specialists. While this story paints a reasonably fair picture of a small test of a brief behavioral therapy for insomnia, the overall impression given to readers may have shaded toward emphasizing the positive while skipping over uncertainties, future research challenges and possible alternative approaches.

Seaman\n\nMelanoma survivors may want to enlist partners to help search their bodies for suspicious looking moles, according to new research.\n\nThe researchers previously found that skin cancer survivors and their partners could be trained to spot potentially cancerous moles by doing skin exams. The new report shows that during the two years, those same people had increasing confidence in their skills, with no increase in embarrassment or discomfort.\n\n“There was concern that they might be embarrassed by examining areas of the body that aren’t normally seen close up,” said lead author Dr. June Robinson, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\n\nMelanoma survivors were previously told to use mirrors to check inaccessible areas of their bodies, she told Reuters Health.\n\n“For example, men can’t see the top of their bald heads or the back of their necks or ears,” Robinson said.\n\nThe new study focused on 395 pairs of melanoma survivors who had received training in skin exams in the original study. The participants attended “booster” training sessions and completed surveys every four months for the next two years.\n\nOverall, the trained group found 51 early melanomas during the study, compared to 18 melanomas found by a comparison group of patients and partners who didn’t receive training.\n\nAmong people who received the skin exam training, the researchers found a steep increase in their confidence at performing skin exams between the start of the study and four months later.\n\n“Their confidence level goes up and plateaus at eight to 12 months, and it doesn’t go down,” said Robinson.\n\nThe exams didn’t become more embarrassing or less comfortable, either.\n\nThe new results show people can ask friends or relatives to help examine their bodies for suspicious moles, said Robinson.\n\n“That’s a simple enough statement, and people are not put off by that,” she said.\n\nBringing this program into the mainstream presents some challenges, however. Each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months.\n\n“We are now trying to see if people can learn, perform and have continuing confidence without the physician reinforcement,” said Robinson.\n\nFor now, she said people can go to the American Academy of Dermatology's website to learn the steps - known as the ABCDEs - of finding melanoma (bit.ly/2h9zl0Y).""]",One downside to this story is the lack of independent sources.,"This is a bite-size but informative story from Reuters Health reporting new research that assessed the confidence levels and feelings of embarrassment in people helping melanoma survivors to look for suspicious moles in hard-to-see body parts.
One downside to this story is the lack of independent sources. Without a third-party opinion, it is hard to understand how important this new research is.

The devices are already in use at some comprehensive stroke centers across the United States, and three designs are approved here.\n\nBut many centers, citing mixed findings on the devices’ benefits, have either abandoned or have been reluctant to offer the treatment, which is costly and complex to provide. Insurers also have been skeptical of the procedure’s value, and many refuse to pay for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of two of the clinical trials were published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at an international conference on stroke in Nashville. Two more studies described at the meeting offered further confirmation of the clot-retrieval devices’ benefits.\n\nThe new studies were hailed by some as “game changers” in stroke care: UCLA stroke specialist Dr. Sidney Starkman said the presentations were greeted with standing ovations among neurologists and neurosurgeons at the conference.\n\nAt UCLA’s Stroke Center, Starkman said, “we’ve seen how well it works and have a team and a system that’s really ready” to provide intra-arterial stroke treatment. “We were enthusiastic all along and wanted to get others to do the same.”\n\nThe new research is expected to usher in more widespread use of clot-grabbing technologies at stroke centers across the nation. It comes just a year after a three widely cited studies — also published in the New England Journal of Medicine — failed to show benefits for stroke patients who got the additional therapy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the two large studies published Wednesday, researchers showed that more careful selection and speedy treatment of patients who got intra-arterial therapy yielded clearer evidence of the treatment’s benefits.\n\nIn both of the large clinical trials — one conducted in Canada, the United States, South Korea, Ireland and Britain, and the other in Australia and New Zealand — stroke patients needed to arrive at a participating hospital with a portion of their brain still undamaged by the lack of blood flow. Each of the hospitals performed extensive radiological scans to assess the extent of damage to the brain and locate and evaluate the size of the clot.\n\nTreatment also had to come quickly. The use of alteplase, a clot-dissolving medication also known as tPA, is limited to otherwise healthy patients who arrive at a hospital within 3 to 4.5 hours of stroke onset. In the Australia/New Zealand study, treatment with a clot-retrieving device had to be initiated within six hours of the onset of stroke symptoms and completed within eight hours.\n\nCompared with the 35 stroke patients who got clot-dissolving medicine alone, the 35 who got the two-pronged treatment were nearly twice as likely to regain some neurological function after three days. Imaging results revealed that for those who got both treatments, 100% of the brain tissue initially affected by a clot had blood flowing to it after 24 hours. Among the subjects who only got alteplase, the median level of restored blood flow was 37%.\n\nIn the other study, involving 238 stroke patients treated with alteplase, 90% of those who were also treated with an intra-arterial device were still alive 90 days later and 53% were considered functionally independent. Among the rest, 81% survived to 90 days and 29% were functionally independent.\n\nBoth clinical trials were ended early when it became clear that the dual therapy was superior to clot-dissolving medication alone.\n\n“These are overwhelmingly, unequivocally positive numbers,” said Dr. J Mocco, director of cerebrovascular surgery for Mt. Sinai Health System in New York City. The studies suggest that, on average, for every 2.5 to 4 patients treated with intra-arterial therapy, one could be expected to have an outcome better than they would have had with alteplase alone.\n\n“This is radically better than anything we’ve had,” said Mocco, who was not involved with either trial. The studies’ ethnically diverse patient population also means the findings are likely to be widely applicable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, Mocco cautioned that few U.S. hospitals — including those with specialized stroke centers — were ready to offer intra-arterial stroke treatment.\n\n“There are a great many centers that will report they have the capability to provide these services,” he said. “But there are truthfully relatively few that have put in the effort and expertise to create the comprehensive team-based work flow needed to rapidly evaluate and treat these patients safely and efficiently.”\n\nIn the United States, three clot-retrieval devices are approved for marketing. Two are designed to capture a clot in a mesh pouch: the Solitaire Flow Restoration stent retriever made by Covidien and the Trevo stent device made by Stryker Corp. The third is the Penumbra thromboaspiration device from Penumbra Inc., which suctions up a blood clot instead.\n\nThe Canada-led trial was funded in part by the University of Calgary, Alberta Health Services and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. The Australia/New Zealand trial was paid for by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Royal Melbourne Hospital Foundation and the Heart Foundation of Australia. Both trials also received financial and infrastructure support from Covidien, the maker of one of the devices.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @LATMelissaHealy']","This story delivers most of what readers need to know about four new studies of stroke treatment — even if it does, at times, get a bit caught up in the excitement surrounding the results.","This is an example of good medical reporting.

Months later, he shocked the world again by releasing a statement teasing he was in remission. He said a bit more before a videotaped Sunday school class he led, noting an immunotherapy drug called pembrolizumab — known better as Keytruda — was part of his treatment alongside surgery and radiation. (See our previous coverage: What the media got wrong about Jimmy Carter’s cancer cure.)
NBC News has followed the story since it broke last summer, and the outlet revisited it again on the coattails of a new study on Keytruda, published April 19, 2016 in JAMA. NBC News’ latest story was also accompanied by a 2-minute video.
The stories together do a nice job of walking readers through the study’s numbers, how pembrolizumab might work, the side effects, costs, and other details. It also cites several researchers who weren’t involved with the study and addresses a key issue with hype by stating the study’s finding “doesn’t mean a cure.”
This vivid picture of success may set readers up for false expectations of benefit. Because as the story itself points out, a majority of patients treated with the drug didn’t live longer than three years.

Compliance with colonoscopy is low, since people don’t want to have one, and the overall cost per detection is high because most people are healthy, and even colonoscopy misses many tumors in the upper part of the intestine.\n\nExact Sciences now plans to enlist several thousand patients in a prospective trial designed to win the Food and Drug Administration’s approval. The trial will be completed in 2012 and the test, if approved, should be available shortly thereafter.\n\n“If widely used, and regularly, this test really does have the opportunity to eliminate colon cancer,” said Dr. David A. Ahlquist, a colon cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic and an adviser to Exact Sciences.\n\nThe practical value of the tests depends critically on details like their sensitivity, meaning the proportion of tumors that are detected, and their specificity, meaning how many of the positive results are in fact false alarms.\n\nExact Sciences reported in July that its test was highly sensitive and specific when applied directly to cells taken from tumors. But in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples, even though almost all the DNA comes from the bacteria of the gut. Just 0.01 percent of the DNA is human, and most of this is normal DNA, not the altered DNA of tumors.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This may be acceptable, given that the worst that will happen is that the patient will get an unnecessary colonoscopy.\n\n“With stool tests, you need a 90 percent specificity,” said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer expert at Johns Hopkins University who is also an adviser to the company. “Exact Sciences has gotten close to that. There’s a lot of hope for getting a stool-based test.”\n\nPromising results for the blood-based tests were reported this week at a meeting in Barcelona, Spain. Epigenomics said its test had a sensitivity of 86 percent and a specificity of 93 percent.\n\nProponents of each test note possible weaknesses of the other. Dr. Achim Plum, a vice president for Epigenomics, said that 30 to 40 percent of people have small polyps, but less than 10 percent of these ever become cancerous. The colon-based test may pick up too many of these, sending far too many people in for colonoscopy.\n\n“The health economics of such a test make no sense,” he said.\n\nBut the blood-based test may have a similar problem, since a positive signal could come from cancers anywhere in the body. If the patient is advised to take a whole body imaging scan, more false positives could be generated “so you end up doing more harm than good,” Dr. Vogelstein said.\n\nDr. Plum said that Epigenomics did not see its test as being necessarily in competition with the Exact Sciences test, because the blood-based test would be good alternative for people put off by stool testing.""]","Not good enough on some key criteria:  costs, evaluating the quality of the evidence, getting independent sources, and comparing the new approaches with existing alternatives.","Strengths:  Immediately, in the opening words, the story acknowledges that there is another DNA test in development that was reported on this week.

This can cause less blood to reach the brain and, in rare cases, may also trigger a stroke if plaque breaks off and becomes lodged in the small vessels in the brain.\n\n""Only a small minority of patients with carotid stenosis will suffer a stroke,"" said lead researcher Dr. Raffi Topakian, from the Academic Teaching Hospital Wagner-Jauregg in Linz, Austria.\n\nThe problem is identifying the patients at the highest risk for stroke, he said. Most patients with carotid stenosis can be managed with medications such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, blood pressure-lowering drugs and blood thinners such as aspirin, he added.\n\nBut those at highest risk may need a surgical procedure called an endarterectomy, which clears the carotid arteries of plaque.\n\n""We found with two ultrasound methods we could differentiate the patients who are at very low risk of suffering a stroke -- lower than 1 percent per year -- from patients at high risk of stroke -- higher than 8 percent per year,"" Topakian said.\n\nThe patients who are at high risk are candidates for surgery, he said. Endarterectomy is not recommended for most people with carotid stenosis since the problem can be managed with drugs and there are risks, including stroke, with the procedure, Topakian said.\n\nThose who would benefit from the ultrasound test are people with known carotid stenosis who are fit for surgery, Topakian said. ""If they are too sick or frail for surgery, it makes no sense to do the ultrasound,"" he said.\n\nIn addition, people at high risk for stroke are also candidates for ultrasound, Topakian said. This would include people with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or heart disease, he said. ""This test could be a good tool to identify the right patients for surgery,"" Topakian said.\n\nOf course, anyone with symptomatic carotid stenosis is a candidate for immediate surgery, Topakian said. Warning signs include transient ischemic attacks (TIAS), or mini-strokes, which cause no permanent damage but are often followed by a stroke within a few days.\n\nThe report was published in the Aug. 17 online edition of Neurology.\n\nFor the study, a research team led by Topakian followed 435 people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for two years.\n\nEach participant had an ultrasound to see if there were signs that a stroke might occur. These included tiny blood clots, which pass into the brain, and a type of plaque called echolucent plaque, which is fattier than other plaque and linked with an increased risk for stroke.\n\nAmong those in the study, 38 percent had the fattier-than-normal plaque, 17 percent had signs of blood clots and 27 percent had both the fattier plaque and blood clots, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, over the two years of the study, 10 people had TIAs.\n\nMoreover, people with the fattier plaque were more than six times more likely to have a stroke than those people without the plaque, and those with the fattier plaque and clots had a risk that was 10 times higher, Topakian\'s team found.\n\nNonetheless, some experts said that research suggests that patients with no symptoms are better off without the surgery.\n\nDr. Lars Marquardt,a professor of surgery at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany and co-author of an accompanying journal editorial, said surgery for people with asymptomatic carotid steno sis is done too frequently.\n\nMarquardt noted that the risks associated with the surgery are a lot higher than leaving the stenosis as it is and starting aggressive medical treatment.\n\n""Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis don\'t get the surgical procedure early enough, and patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have too many surgical interventions,"" Marquardt said.\n\nWhen treating asymptomatic carotid stenosis, Marquardt doesn\'t think the case has been made for distinguishing between high- and low-risk patients. Right now, the work done by Topakian\'s group is still ""experimental,"" he said.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Larry B. Goldstein, director of the Duke University Stroke Center, said that ""what remains uncertain is whether surgical intervention would result in an overall improvement in stroke-free survival.""\n\n""It is also unclear how optimal medical management [lifestyle changes in addition to anti-platelet medication and statins] would affect overall stroke and cardiovascular risk, and stroke-free survival,"" he said.\n\nBoth the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association currently recommend against general population screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, Goldstein noted.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on stroke, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""> An interesting story on an important topic.  Independent perspectives contributed a great deal. </span>","There were elements of this story that may have confused readers, but the money quotes from an independent expert helped clarify the take-home message:

Even today, in much of the developing world, people exercise through activities such as farming and fetching water that are necessary for survival.\n\nHowever, in the developed Western world, where exercise tends to be an extracurricular activity, there is apparently tremendous interest in just how fast you should move in order to improve your health. Consider, for example, the many posts on The New York Times’ Well blog on the topic (walking versus running, the “right dose of exercise,” “walk hard, walk easy”), all of which focus on the relative benefits of walking versus jogging versus running.\n\nSo is it better to walk? To walk fast? To run slow? To run fast? On its face, this question is poorly posed, since it says nothing about our goals or our constraints. Am I aiming to lose weight? To live longer? To win road races? Am I willing to exercise for three hours a day? Twenty minutes? Almost never? Clearly, these considerations matter when trying to determine the optimal speed. Here is how I would think about asking the question instead: What is the easiest way to reduce my chance of death?\n\nTo analyze the impact of walking or running, researchers need a way to describe the effort exerted. The ideal measure would combine the length of time spent exercising with the amount of energy expended — basically, we want to figure out a way to credit people who walk at half the speed for twice as long the same amount as those who walk faster for less time.\n\nThe way researchers do this is with a measurement known as MET — metabolic equivalent of task — which gives a numeric value to various activities depending on their energy intensity. By multiplying an activity’s METs by the time you engage in it, you can get an overall measure of how much energy you expend.\n\nThe goal here is to use these METs and their relationship to health to analyze the value of walking compared with jogging or running. At least in this article, I won’t say anything about other kinds of exercise — no yoga or SoulCycle — though these have their own MET measures.\n\nLet’s first look at the results from two papers — here and here — that relate energy expenditures from walking (in MET hours per day) to the risk of death.\n\nDoing this analysis is a little complicated. You can’t look at the relationship between exercise and the chance of ever dying, because ultimately everyone dies. Instead, these studies look at whether exercise changes the risk of death at a given time. But since the people in the studies are of different ages, researchers can’t just look to see whether they have, say, a 2 percentage point lower risk of death in a given year, since that lower risk would mean a lot more for someone who is 30 than for someone who is 90. Results in these two papers — and basically all the others we’ll look at here — therefore report their results in “hazard ratios.” A hazard rate of 0.90, for example, means a 10 percent reduction in the risk of death. If there is a 10 in 1,000 chance you’ll die in the next year without exercise, this means by exercising you’d reduce that chance to 9 in 1,000.\n\nThis research shows that those who walk have a lower risk of mortality relative to people in the comparison group, who don’t walk for exercise at all (they probably do still walk some, just not for exercise). This risk of death is lower even with a very minimal energy expenditure. The lowest-energy-expenditure group in each study is walking at about 3 mph for 20 to 40 minutes per day. In other words, a mile or two of walking. In exchange, their risk of death goes down by 10 percent.\n\nWalking a bit farther — say, 2 to 3 miles at 3 mph — gets you an additional death reduction of about 30 percent. But walking more than that, or more than an hour a day at this speed, is no better.\n\nOther studies of walking find similar magnitudes. A large meta-analysis found that, on average, walking 1 to 3 miles at about a 20-minute-mile pace results in a reduction in death risk of about 10 percent.\n\nMany of these studies do not separate out speed and duration, but to the extent they do, it seems like walking faster may be better than walking slower. Here is one study that shows large mortality reductions for fast walking even for short periods, and here is another showing that very slow walking has fewer benefits than faster walking.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem obvious that the harder you exercise, the better. If walking faster is more energy-intensive than walking slower, and running is more energy-intensive than walking, it seems like the health benefits of running would be even greater. In some sense, you’d hope so, since most of us find running more difficult than walking.\n\nBroadly, over some range, this seems to be right. The chart below shows results for two studies of runners that, again, relate METs to hazard rates of death. Running — even slowly, like 5 mph — is far more energy-intensive than walking. An energy expenditure of 1.19 METs per day (the lowest-energy-expenditure group in the second study here) means about 20 minutes of running a 12-minute mile, three times a week.\n\nSlow running like this appears to have a much larger impact on mortality than walking. A hazard rate of 0.48 — compared with a sedentary group — suggests a much larger reduction in the risk of death than a hazard rate of 0.90. What is a bit surprising about this chart is that running faster or farther doesn’t seem to reduce death rates any more than running slowly and, in fact, in both cases is slightly worse.\n\nIn one of these studies it looks like running very intensely (faster than an eight-minute mile, more than four hours a week) increases your risk of death relative to not running at all. But a closer look at the data suggests that this is probably just a statistical artifact: This intense running group contains only 36 people and two deaths, versus hundreds of people in the more casual running groups.\n\nEven if we dismiss the possibility that running harder is worse, it is probably useful to note that running harder or farther doesn’t seem to be better. I have occasionally felt guilty about my thrice-weekly 25-minute runs, especially in comparison to my brother, who runs a 2:45 marathon and once attempted the Leadville Trail 100. It is comforting to know that I can still outlive him.\n\nOne general problem with all of this research is that none of these studies is randomized. People who exercise are different from those who do not, and those who exercise more are different from those who exercise less. This should, as usual, give us some pause in trumpeting the virtues of exercise. However, I’d argue that the comparisons the studies make among runners are still valid.\n\nTo be more concrete: In most of these studies, the more intense runners are healthier (for example: less likely to smoke and thinner) than the less-intense runners. We may tend to attribute the health of this group to their running habits. The fact that even with this bias we see no large benefit — indeed, seemingly no benefit at all — to running more rather than running less reinforces the value of moderate running.\n\nIf we take this research at face value, we learn a few things. First, some exercise reduces your risk of death. Second, the optimal walking/jogging exercise is light to moderate jogging. The optimal speed is between 5 and 7 mph, and if you do 25 minutes about three times a week, you’re all set. Nothing in the data suggests that running more — farther, or faster — will do more to lower your risk of death.']",How fast should you run to live longer? This story provides clear answer based on the best available evidence.,"The story looks at several studies to address how much time an individual needs to devote to cardiovascular exercise each week in order to significantly reduce their risk of death in a given year. The story also attempts to address whether it is better walk, jog, or run in order to achieve the desired reduction in risk. Ultimately, the story makes three statements: some exercise reduces the risk of death (in a given year); light to moderate jogging (between 5 and 7 miles per hour) is the optimal pace; and if you do 25 minutes of jogging at this pace, three times per week, “you’re all set.” Although the language used in places is not as precise as we’d like (based on the available evidence, we can’t really say whether exercise at a given intensity “reduces” death risk as the story states, merely that it is “associated with” lower risk), the coverage overall is thorough and balanced. The story is up front with readers about the limitations of the studies and provides a clear explanation of them. And it’s hard to argue with the advice that some moderate exercise is worthwhile. The story would have been better if it had addressed the fact that running (even recreationally) poses some health risks — and is not an option for many readers.

REUTERS/Ali Jarekji\n\nThe test, which uses conventional magnetic resonance imaging or MRI machines, detected 94 percent of individuals with a high-functioning form of autism, they reported on Thursday.\n\n“These results are the best yet in the search for a biological basis in terms of being able to distinguish those with and without the disease,” said Nicholas Lange of Harvard Medical School, who directs the Neurostatistics Laboratory at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts.\n\nHe said the findings, published in the journal Autism Research, were very preliminary, but if confirmed in several more and larger studies, they might replace current subjective tests now used to diagnose the disorder.\n\nAnd, he said, they might also lead to better management and treatment of people with autism, a complex and mysterious brain disorder usually first diagnosed in early childhood.\n\nAutism is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and understanding other people’s emotions and behavior.\n\nFor the study, researchers at McLean and a team led by Dr. Janet Lainhart the University of Utah used an MRI that was tuned to pick up microscopic features of the brain’s wiring — a technique known as diffusion tensor imaging.\n\n“You don’t need any fancy equipment. This is performed around the world,” Lange said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe team did scans of this type on the brains of 30 people with autism and 30 people without.\n\nThey found that the brain circuitry is significantly different in those with autism compared to people with normal brain function, specifically in areas of the brain that are engaged in language and social and emotional functioning.\n\nBy measuring six aspects of the brain’s circuitry, the test was able to correctly pick out people who had been diagnosed with autism with 94 percent accuracy.\n\nA repeat study using two different sets of subjects showed the same high level of performance.\n\nLange said the findings should help make the process of diagnosing autism more scientific because it would rely on a test rather than a subjective assessment.\n\nAnd it may also offer an early diagnosis, which could help affected children get earlier intervention, when it is most likely to do some good.\n\n“The basis of autism in the brain is very deep. There may be very little that one can actually change about the disorder for an individual with a severe case,” Lange said.\n\n“However, it has been shown that in the early stages of development, individuals have been aided by intense one-on-one caring to help them with language, social function with their peers and also with emotional problems,” he said.\n\nAutism disorders are diagnosed in one in 110 children in the United States and affect four times as many boys as girls.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">Reuters blew this very small study with obvious design limitations far out of proportion, trumpeting it as “closing in on an accurate test for autism, a finding that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.” Meantime, the lead researcher, <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3402"" target=""_blank"">in a CNN story</a>, said it’s not ready for prime time.<br/>

1888,news_reviews_00137,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/news-release-review/newcastle-us-second-take-on-type-2-diabetes-research-still-comes-up-short/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,Type 2 diabetes is not for life,"['Type 2 diabetes is not for life Published on: 5 December 2017 Almost half of the patients with Type 2 diabetes supported by their GPs on a weight loss programme were able to reverse their diabetes in a year, a study has found.\n\nThe first year results, which are published today in The Lancet, also revealed that almost nine out of 10 people (86%) who lost 15kg or more put their Type 2 diabetes into remission. The study led by Professor Roy Taylor, from Newcastle University, and Professor Mike lean from Glasgow University, found that 45.6% of those who were put on a low calorie diet for three to five months and were able to stop their Type 2 diabetes medications. Importantly, long-term support by routine General Practice staff was given to help the paticipants maintain their weight loss. The trial, called DiRECT (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial) and funded by Diabetes UK, recruited 298 people between the Newcastle and Glasgow University and builds on Professor Taylor’s earlier pilot work. Professor Taylor, lead researcher of the DiRECT trial, said: “These findings are very exciting. They could revolutionise the way Type 2 diabetes is treated. “The study builds on the work into the underlying cause of the condition, so that we can target management effectively. “Substantial weight loss results in reduced fat inside the liver and pancreas, allowing these organs to return to normal function. “What we’re seeing from DiRECT is that losing weight isn’t just linked to better management of Type 2 diabetes: significant weight loss could actually result in lasting remission.""\n\nProfessor Roy Taylor\n\nThese findings are very exciting. They could revolutionise the way Type 2 diabetes is treated Professor Roy Taylor\n\nRemission achieved Remission was defined as having blood glucose levels (HbA1c) of less than 6.5% (48mmol/mol) at 12 months, with at least two months without any Type 2 diabetes medications. Of the 298 people recruited to take part in DiRECT, half received standard diabetes care from their GP, whilst the other half received a structured weight management programme within primary care. The programme included a low calorie, nutrient-complete diet for three to five months, food reintroduction and long-term support to maintain weight loss. Type 2 diabetes remission was found to be closely related to weight loss. Over half (57%) of those who lost 10 to 15kg achieved remission, along with a third (34%) of those who lost five to 10kg. Only 4% of the control group achieved remission. The findings have been presented at the International Diabetes Federation Congress in Abu Dhabi today by the lead researchers, Professor Taylor and Professor Mike Lean. Professor Lean said: “Putting Type 2 diabetes into remission as early as possible after diagnosis could have extraordinary benefits, both for the individual and the NHS. DiRECT is telling us it could be possible for as many as half of patients to achieve this in routine primary care, and without drugs. “We’ve found that people were really interested in this approach – almost a third of those who were asked to take part in the study agreed. This is much higher than usual acceptance rates for diabetes clinical trials.""\n\nTwo-year trial DiRECT is a two-year trial which aims to find an effective and accessible way to put Type 2 diabetes into remission for the long-term. The trial is delivered through GP practices across Tyneside and Scotland to find out if the benefits of a structured weight management programme can be felt in a real-life primary care setting. DiRECT also aims to understand why significant weight loss results in remission, to understand which groups might benefit in the future. Type 2 diabetes is a life-changing condition that progresses over time, which can have devastating consequences. Finding ways to put it into lasting remission could significantly reduce the cost of delivering diabetes care and treating serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease or stroke. Remission could transform the lives of millions of people living with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes. Isobel Murray, 65, from North Ayrshire, took part in DiRECT from 2014 to 2016. She was on the low calorie diet programme for 17 weeks and put her Type 2 diabetes into remission after the first four months. Over the two year trial, Isobel lost more than three and a half stone and no longer needs to take any diabetes medication. Isobel said: “It has transformed my life, I had Type 2 diabetes for two to three years before the study. “I was on various medications which were constantly increasing and I was becoming more and more ill every day. When the opportunity came to go on the DiRECT study, I had absolutely no hesitation. “When the doctors told me that my pancreas was working again, it felt fantastic, absolutely amazing. “I don’t think of myself as a diabetic anymore, I get all my diabetes checks done, but I don’t feel like a diabetic. I am one of the lucky ones to have gone into remission.” Diabetes UK has committed more than £2.8 million to the DiRECT study. Recently, £300,000 has been committed so participants who wish to continue can be followed for up to three years and the full cost-effectiveness of this programme can be evaluated. The funding will provide further understanding around the longer term benefits, to see if a treatment of this kind could be offered to people with Type 2 diabetes in the future. Helping millions Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research at Diabetes UK, said: “These first year findings of DiRECT demonstrate the potential to transform the lives of millions of people. “We’re very encouraged by these initial results, and the building robust evidence that remission could be achievable for some people. “The trial is ongoing, so that we can understand the long-term effects of an approach like this. It’s very important that anyone living with Type 2 diabetes considering losing weight in this way seeks support and advice from a healthcare professional.” Whether putting Type 2 diabetes into remission can protect against diabetes-related complications later in life is not yet known, which is why it is important that those who achieve remission continue to receive health checks. More research is also needed to find out who could benefit most from treatments like this in the future, taking into account factors like ethnicity and duration of Type 2 diabetes.

DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)33102-1\n\nLatest News']",The more recent release does a better job of addressing benefits and the quality of the evidence.,"The news release focuses on a Lancet article describing the first-year results of an ongoing two-year study aimed at determining how effective diet-based weight loss can be at achieving remission of type 2 diabetes in adults. The release notes that 45.6 percent of patients who took part in the weight loss program achieved remission of their type 2 diabetes, and that remission was closely correlated with weight loss; the more weight study participants lost, the more likely they were to achieve remission.
While the release does a good job of describing the study, it does not mention previous studies related to weight loss and type 2 diabetes. That’s a significant oversight that makes it difficult for readers to place the new findings in context. It’s worth noting that HealthNewsReview.org reviewed a previous release from the same university on earlier findings from the same research group. While the more recent release does a better job of addressing benefits and the quality of the evidence, some problems — such as the failure to address novelty and place the work in context — were not addressed.  Further, there is no mention in the release about the conflicts of interest on the part of several authors in their relationships with Counterweight and Cambridge Weight Plans.
And like the TIME story on the Newcastle University research, the release doesn’t inform readers about cost and harms of the diet.

Michael Lauer, director of the cardiovascular-sciences division at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, wrote in a commentary accompanying the CCTA study, ""We cannot simply assume that just because a screening test predicts clinical outcomes, interventions necessarily will prevent them.""\n\nThe study of CCTA screening comes as medical experts are re-evaluating the frequency and usefulness of other types of health screening, including mammographies for women and PSA testing for prostate cancer in men.\n\nThe CCTA test isn\'t currently a common screening test for heart disease, and American Heart Association guidelines recommend against such use of it. Still, Dr. Lauer said such use is likely to grow. The test costs from $600 to $1,000 per patient, researchers say.\n\nDr. Lauer said the heart, lung and blood institute is funding separate studies of CCTA involving patients with chest pain and other symptoms of heart disease to better define how to use the test.\n\nFor now, most doctors assess risk for coronary heart disease using blood tests to measure cholesterol and other fats in the blood, and then in some cases prescribe medication to lower cholesterol. Imaging tests often are reserved for patients with chest pain or other heart-disease signs.\n\nIn a CCTA test, patients are injected with dye and then undergo a scan, which creates three-dimensional images of the heart and blood vessels. The images show plaque and other deposits that often build up inside blood vessels and can lead to heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems.\n\nThe test differs from a coronary angiogram or a cardiac catheterization, in which a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or leg and then guided into the heart to look for blockages or narrowing of blood vessels.\n\nIn contrast, the CCTA scan isn\'t invasive, and for that reason some medical experts say it has potential to be widely used for screening healthy patients for heart disease. Some anecdotal evidence suggests such screening is happening and becoming more common.\n\nThe researchers looked at patients who weren\'t considered high risk but did exhibit some risk factors for heart disease. Almost all adults over age 50 likely have some plaque in their arteries, he said.\n\nThe study involved 2,000 patients in South Korea with an average age of 50 taking part in a health-screening program. The study compared 1,000 individuals who underwent a CCTA exam with 1,000 who didn\'t undergo the test.\n\nIt found 215 patients who underwent the exam had a positive result, meaning they were found to have plaque in their blood vessels. These patients were 10 times as likely to have been sent for an exercise stress test, a nuclear medicine scan or a cardiac catheterization as patients who didn\'t have the CCTA test.\n\nThe patients also were three times as likely to be taking a statin medication, and four times as likely to be on aspirin therapy, both designed to lower risk of heart attack.\n\nAfter 18 months, the study showed, one person in the CCTA group developed a heart problem known as unstable angina and one person in the non-testing group had a fatal heart attack.\n\n""Our findings suggest that low-risk patients without symptoms don\'t benefit in the short term from knowing whether or not plaque has been detected using CT angiography,"" Dr. McEvoy said. ""However, their physicians may be inclined to be more aggressive with prescriptions or follow-up tests.""\n\nPatients would have to be followed for a longer period to look at whether there\'s a true difference in heart events and heart-related deaths between the two groups, Dr. McEvoy said.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Corbett Dooren at jennifer.corbett-dooren@dowjones.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story addressed most of our criteria and was a technically competent story.  But it lacked the clarity on significance and the punch that a competing </span>","This story reported on a study which found that using coronary CT angiography to screen for heart disease did not result in improved outcomes for patients during the 18 months in which they were studied.
It could have emphasized that neither this CT test – nor traditional cardiac catheterization – is recommended for the kinds of people evaluated in this South Korean study.
And it should have discussed the potential harms of the newer test – thereby missing the punchline that Reuters delivered:  “Testing might lead to more harm than good.”

1897,story_reviews_01528,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/2945/,2010-06-22 04:00:00,New Tools for Helping Heart Patients,"[""They are part of a new wave of smart implantable devices that is transforming the care of people with heart disease and creating a bonanza for researchers. The hope is that the devices, now being tested in clinical trials, will save lives, reduce medical expenses and nudge heart patients toward managing their symptoms much the way people with diabetes manage theirs. Patients, who often are frail or live far from their doctors, can be spared frequent office visits. Doctors can learn immediately if devices are malfunctioning or if patients’ hearts are starting to fail.\n\n“It’s like having an office visit every day and a complete physical every week,” said Dr. Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe big leap forward came a few years ago when device companies figured out how to make transmitters that send data over a broader range, 20 or 30 feet. That meant that, with her device, Mrs. Elzo did not have to wait till her doctor could put a receiver directly on her chest. Instead, she simply went near a small box, which is attached to a phone jack near her bed. Once a week, she also measures her weight and blood pressure — key indicators of heart failure — and that information is automatically transmitted to her doctor. If there are problems, the machine alerts her doctor.\n\n“Now, every single day the device is being queried,” said her doctor, James Coman of the Heart Rhythm Institute in Tulsa. “It’s just a phenomenal tool.”\n\nThere is a downside, though: “Information overload is a very serious problem” for the doctors, said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, director of the Heart Failure Program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, who counts herself as a proponent of smart devices. More information, she warned, is not always beneficial.\n\nThe devices transmit useful data along with data whose significance is not clear, like variations in heart rate. Large swings in heart rate can indicate risk, but it is not clear what to do about them.\n\nEven more confusing are changes in thoracic impedance, a measurement of resistance to electric current through the lung. Impedance changes can predict future heart crises, but more often have no clinical explanation. Yet when doctors get data on impedance changes, they often feel uneasy and call patients to see how they are, making patients uneasy in turn, Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Stevenson likened such information to the game of “Jeopardy!” — doctors are given answers in search of a question. It’s a challenge even for the nation’s 1,000 heart failure specialists. But it can be even harder for primary care doctors, who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition.\n\nDr. Richard Page, president of the Heart Rhythm Society, said doctors wonder if they can be held liable if they do not look at all the data. Still, he said, the new technology “is potentially transformative.”\n\nFor researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem: how to analyze the data. A large clinical trial of a cardiac device used to involve 1,000, maybe 2,000 patients. Now, Boston Scientific, a maker of one of the smart heart devices, is following 400,000 patients.\n\n“No one has ever done research like this before,” said Dr. Saxon, who leads an independent team of academic scientists overseeing Boston Scientific research. The company has no editorial control over the papers the scientists write, Dr. Saxon said.\n\nBoston Scientific gets data from patients’ defibrillators. It also gets information on deaths from Medicare.\n\nThe data are stripped of patient identifiers and analyzed, a task requiring the company to become more like a Google or a Microsoft, handling enormous amounts of information. There are, for example, more than four million recordings of weights and blood pressures and over 60,000 instances when the defibrillators went off, shocking a patient’s heart.\n\nSo far, Dr. Saxon’s group has reported on the first 90,000 patients. Half of them had not been enrolled for remote monitoring and served as a control group.\n\nPhoto\n\nPatients whose doctors looked at the data survived 5 to 15 percent longer than patients in earlier clinical trials of the devices, Dr. Saxon reported. And, in a paper under review, the group reports that their three-year survival was significantly greater than that of patients in the study whose doctors did not see the data.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther researchers will be analyzing economic data. The devices can cost as much as $30,000. Do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits?\n\nA study using a similar device, made by Medtronic, suggests that is the case. The Medtronic study, directed by Dr. George Crossley, president of St Thomas Heart at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, involved 2,000 patients randomly assigned to receive a defibrillator that transmitted data or a device that did not transmit. Those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor’s offices every few months, the standard of care.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One solution, being tested by St. Jude Medical, a medical device company in St. Paul, is to let patients deal with important data.\n\nThe idea, said Dr. Neal Eigler, a senior vice president at St. Jude, is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their heart’s functioning, just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings.\n\nPatients hold a small device over their chest twice a day, and if they experience symptoms like shortness of breath. It transmits readings of blood pressure in the left atrium — the upper left chamber of the heart. If pressure in that chamber gets too high, the lungs can fill with fluid.\n\nDoctors preprogram the hand-held device to provide instructions to patients in response to their left atrial pressure measurements, telling them, for example, to take a different dose of a medication, restrict fluid intake, increase their activity level or call the clinic.\n\nIf successful, the smart device could have a big effect. One million patients a year are hospitalized for heart failure. Ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Stevenson, who has no connection with St. Jude, is intrigued. Patients can see what is happening to their own bodies and act accordingly. They have to strictly limit salt in their diet, for example, and seeing their left atrial pressure might be motivating.\n\n“A patient might say, ‘Maybe my pressure is higher because that pizza I had for dinner last night had a lot of salt,’ ” Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nAs a more positive incentive, the device can also instruct patients to decrease their medications if they are doing well.\n\nSt. Jude recently completed a small study of 40 patients and is starting a large clinical trial. In the pilot study, the device reduced the frequency of high atrial pressure readings by two-thirds and the number of hospitalizations by 80 percent over five months.\n\nMeanwhile, patients whose doctors can deal with the data stream from smart devices say they are getting peace of mind.\n\nThey include people like Danielle Denlein, who, to her total shock, developed a serious heart problem.On October 20, 2008, at 1:50 p.m., Ms. Denlein was driving to a drug store to buy formula for her 5-day-old baby girl. Suddenly, she felt a pain in her chest. She thought it was heartburn. Then it began radiating down her arm.\n\n“I just knew — I don’t know how I knew, but I knew — I was having a heart attack,” she said.\n\nAlthough she was only 35, her main coronary artery had ripped open, a rare complication associated with pregnancy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Denlein now relies on her smart defibrillator to save her from her injured heart, and to alert her doctor, Dr. Saxon, to problems if they occur.\n\n“It’s life changing,” Ms. Denlein said. “It gives me such a feeling of comfort.”\n\nMrs. Elzo feels the same way.\n\nHad her device not alerted her doctor that it needed to be replaced, she said, “I shudder to think what would have happened.”""]","While the use of new technology to provide better solutions to common problems is a source of hope, this story focused nearly exclusively on this aspect without questioning the magnitude of the benefits vs. harms and without giving a realistic evaluation of the costs.  ","This is a classic story of the potential promise of a new technology for the health care sector. A nice anecdote sets the stage and then a number of preliminary findings are used as proxies for real evidence. It is implied that the technology will keep people healthier, happier and at less cost to our costly system. This is, unfortunately, often a fairy tale mainstay of health news journalism.

Of the study participants who expressed a preference, 62 percent said they preferred the prep-free CT procedure over the colonoscopy.\n\nOnly sixty percent of Americans age 50 and over get the American Cancer Society’s recommended screening for colon cancer: a colonoscopy every 10 years, fecal occult blood test every year, or a flexible sigmoidoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or barium enema imaging every five years. Surveys suggest that patients find the prep -- required for both colonoscopy and traditional virtual colonoscopy -- to be the worst part of screening.\n\n“A number of folks, who currently aren’t being screened because they fear the prep or aren’t willing to go through it again, may be willing to have screening if they’re told they don’t need to take laxatives and can still get a potent test,” said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colon cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nAbout 49,000 Americans die every year from colon cancer, added Brooks, and at least half of those deaths could be prevented if everyone followed the screening recommendations.\n\nVirtual colonoscopy, with or without prep, has some limitations. About one in five patients must undergo a standard colonoscopy after the imaging procedure to have suspicious looking polyps snipped off and biopsied. The CT scan also delivers a dose of radiation that -- while only one-fifth of the dose of an abdominal CT scan -- was significant enough to raise the flags of the US Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nThe government advisory group decided in 2008 not to recommend the use of virtual colonoscopy, saying that evidence wasn’t sufficient enough to prove that the test’s benefits outweighed its harms, which include a dose of radiation with every screening test.\n\n(Standard colonoscopy also has rare complications such as an adverse reaction to the sedative, perforation to the colon, and bleeding from the site where the polyp was taken.)\n\nMedicare doesn’t provide coverage for the imaging test, which Zalis said costs about one-third as much as the traditional scope screening.\n\nTraditional colonscopy also trumps the virtual test when is comes to detecting smaller polyps, less than 10 millimeters in size. The new study found that virtual colonosopy detected only 70 percent of polyps under 8 millimeters in size, compared with 88 percent detected by a scope. What’s not clear, though, is whether missing these smaller polyps will make a difference in terms of catching growths before they turn into cancer.\n\n“Studies are underway right now,” said Brooks, “to track these smaller lesions, to see what happens to them.”\n\nDeborah Kotz can be reached at dkotz@globe.com. Follow her on Twitter @debkotz2.']",This Boston Globe blog post gave its audience a more thorough understanding of an emerging approach to virtual colonoscopy than the ,"Look at the way the Boston Globe approached this story compared to the Wall Street Journal. The difference is subtle but important. The Journal focused too narrowly on the idea that patients might be able to avoid cleansing their colons before going in to get a computer scan of their intestines. The Globe, under the same deadline pressure, placed the new research into the larger context of the growing but complicated array of methods to detect colon cancer and precancerous polyps early.

Last week, a review of prior studies suggested that selenium probably doesn’t help prevent cancer, but might be linked to an increased diabetes risk at high doses (see Reuters Health story of May 11, 2011.)\n\n“We don’t really know where we are,” Guallar told Reuters Health. “In a sense it’s a necessary micronutrient and we need it, but we might be (in) a situation where we have enough — we might even have too much.”\n\nSelenium is found in meat, bread, and some nuts. It’s also available in supplement form, and costs about $2 for a month’s supply.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine recommends U.S. adults consume 55 micrograms of selenium per day.\n\nGuallar and his colleagues wanted to look specifically at the link between selenium and cholesterol.

""Hopefully, this is a good start for a more reliable test.""\n\nDr. Durado Brooks, director of colorectal cancer at the American Cancer Society, agreed. ""These findings are interesting,"" he said. ""They will be more interesting if we ever get this kind of data in a screening population.""\n\nThe study\'s lead researcher remained optimistic.\n\n""There are 150,000 new cases of colon cancer each year in the United States, treated at an estimated cost of $14 billion,"" noted Dr. David A. Ahlquist, professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\n""The dream is to eradicate colon cancer altogether and the most realistic approach to getting there is screening,"" he said. ""And screening not only in a way that would not only detect cancer, but pre-cancer. Our test takes us closer to that dream.""\n\nAhlquist was scheduled to present the findings of the study Thursday in Philadelphia at a meeting on colorectal cancer sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nThe new technology, called the Cologuard sDNA test, works by identifying specific altered DNA in cells shed by pre-cancerous or cancerous polyps into the patient\'s stool.\n\nIf a DNA abnormality is found, a colonoscopy would still be needed to confirm the results, just as happens now after a positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) result.\n\nTo see whether the test was effective, Ahlquist\'s team tried it out on more than 1,100 frozen stool samples from patients with and without colorectal cancer.\n\nThe test was able to detect 85.3 percent of colorectal cancers and 63.8 percent of polyps bigger than 1 centimeter. Polyps this size are considered pre-cancers and most likely to progress to cancer, Ahlquist said.\n\nThe sensitivity of the test is much better than what has been seen in other stool screening tests, the ACS\' Brooks added. ""But, showing that in a small group of samples is very different from demonstrating that in a population where only a small number of individuals are going to have polyps of that size. Then we will know if this is a big step forward,"" he said.\n\nAccording to Ahlquist, Cologuard is the first noninvasive test to detect pre-cancerous polyps, he added.\n\nIn addition, the test is the only one that is able to identify cancer in all locations throughout the colon, something which other tests either can\'t or don\'t do well, Ahlquist said.\n\nOne more advantage: patients do not need to do any special preparation before taking the test, something that other tests require, he added.\n\nAhlquist noted that the test still needs to be refined. ""We learned there are still some bugs and we can make the test even better,"" he said.\n\nCologuard is not yet available for sale. Clinical trials comparing the test with colonoscopy are slated to start next year. Ahlquist hopes that the test will be approved and available within two years.\n\nAhlquist noted that the cost of the test has not yet been established. It is expected to cost more than a fecal occult blood test, but far less than a colonoscopy. A fecal occult blood test can cost as little as $23 while a colonoscopy can total $700.\n\nAnother benefit is that it would probably need to be done once every three years, while the fecal occult blood test is usually done yearly. Savings over time on a more accurate test done fewer times could justify the higher cost of the Cologuard test, Ahlquist said.\n\nIn two other presentations at the meeting, researchers have linked key gene variants to the risk for colon cancer and also to the prognosis of the disease.\n\nIn one study, researchers found that people who have long telomeres, the small strips of DNA that cover the ends of chromosomes, have a 30 percent increased risk of developing colon cancer.\n\n""Even for people their age, their telomeres were longer than you\'d expect for healthy people,"" lead researcher Dr. Lisa A. Boardman, an associate professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic, said in a statement. ""This suggests that there may be two different mechanisms that affect telomere length and that set up susceptibility to cancer,"" she said.\n\nIn the other study, a research team led by Kim M. Smits, a molecular biologist and epidemiologist in the GROW-School for Oncology and Developmental Biology at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands, uncovered a surprise when it came to a gene variant on the KRAS gene called the G variant. This variant, long linked to poorer outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer, actually predicted a better prognosis in early-stage colon cancer.\n\n""You would intuitively think that the G variant would be associated with a poorer prognosis, as it is in late-stage colorectal cancer, but that is not the case,"" Smits said in a statement.\n\nExperts point out that studies presented at scientific meetings do not have to pass the rigorous peer review of studies published in reputable journals.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on colon cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.']",Health Day used the tired old line about the “Holy Grail.” So did the ,"Strengths:  a fairly good evaluation of the limitations of the evidence.
Weaknesses:  Nothing on harms.  Didn’t compare the new approach with another competing new technology (as the New York Times did).  But it also didn’t compare the new approach with existing colon cancer screening methods in a meaningful data-driven way.  So it failed to give readers a sense of the true scope of the potential benefits.

Pestikas struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before starting ketamine treatments earlier in the year. (AP Photo/Teresa Crawford)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.\n\nNow the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Clinics have opened around the United States promising instant relief with their “unique” doses of ketamine in IVs, sprays or pills. And desperate patients are shelling out thousands of dollars for treatment often not covered by health insurance, with scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks.\n\nChicago preschool teacher Lauren Pestikas long struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before trying ketamine earlier this year.\n\nThe price tag so far is about $3,000, but “it’s worth every dime and penny,” said the 36-year-old.\n\nPestikas said she feels much better for a few weeks after each treatment, but the effects wear off and she scrambles to find a way to pay for another one.\n\nFor now, ketamine has not received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating depression, though doctors can use it for that purpose.\n\nKetamine has been around since the 1960s and is widely used as an anesthesia drug during surgery because it doesn’t suppress breathing. Compared to opioids such as morphine, ketamine isn’t as addictive and doesn’t cause breathing problems. And some studies have shown that ketamine can ease symptoms within hours for the toughest cases.\n\nIts potential effects on depression were discovered in animal experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing that glutamate, a brain chemical messenger, might play a role in depression, and that drugs including ketamine that target the glutamate pathway might work as antidepressants.\n\nConventional antidepressants like Prozac target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in — a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair.\n\nKetamine’s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February.\n\n“We don’t have a lot of things that provide that kind of effect. What I worry about is that it gets so hyped up,” she said.\n\nThe strongest studies suggest it’s most useful and generally safe in providing short-term help for patients who have not benefited from antidepressants. That amounts to about one-third of the roughly 300 million people with depression worldwide.\n\n“It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs.\n\nBut to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known.\n\nLast year, Sanacora co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders that noted the benefits but said “major gaps” remain in knowledge about long-term effectiveness and safety. Most studies have been small, done in research settings and not in the real world.\n\nWhen delivered through an IV, ketamine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure that could be dangerous for some patients. Ketamine also can cause hallucinations that some patients find scary.\n\n“There are some very real concerns,” Sanacora said. “We do know this drug can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed.”\n\nDr. Rahul Khare, an emergency medicine specialist in Chicago, first learned about ketamine’s other potential benefits a decade ago from a depressed and anxious patient he was preparing to sedate to fix a repeat dislocated shoulder.\n\n“He said, ‘Doc, give me what I got last time. For about three weeks after I got it I felt so much better,’” Khare recalled.\n\nKhare became intrigued and earlier this year began offering ketamine for severe depression at an outpatient clinic he opened a few years ago. He also joined the American Society for Ketamine Physicians, formed a year ago representing about 140 U.S. doctors, nurses, psychologists and others using ketamine for depression or other nonapproved uses.\n\nThere are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley.\n\nKhare said the burgeoning field “is like a new frontier” where doctors gather at meetings and compare notes. He has treated about 50 patients with depression including Pestikas. They’re typically desperate for relief after failing to respond to other antidepressants. Some have lost jobs and relationships because of severe depression, and most find that ketamine allows them to function, Khare said.\n\nTypical treatment at his clinic involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that, covering Khare’s office visit cost. Patients can receive “booster” treatments. They must sign a four-page consent form that says benefits may not be long-lasting, lists potential side effects, and in bold letters states that the treatment is not government-approved.\n\nAt a recent session, Pestikas’s seventh, she leaned back on a reclining white examining-room chair as a nurse hooked her up to a heart and blood pressure monitor. She grimaced as a needle was slipped into the top of her left palm. Khare reached up with a syringe to inject a small dose of ketamine into an IV bag hanging above the chair, then dimmed the lights, pulled the window curtains and asked if she had questions and was feeling OK.\n\n“No questions, just grateful,” Pestikas replied, smiling.\n\nPestikas listened to music on her iPhone and watched psychedelic videos. She said it was like “a controlled acid trip” with pleasant hallucinations. The trip ends soon after the IV is removed, but Pestikas said she feels calm and relaxed the rest of the day, and that the mood boost can last weeks.\n\nStudies suggest that a single IV dose of ketamine far smaller than used for sedation or partying can help many patients gain relief within about four hours and lasting nearly a week or so.\n\nExactly how ketamine works is unclear, but one idea is that by elevating glutamate levels, ketamine helps nerve cells re-establish connections that were disabled by depression, said ketamine expert Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of experimental therapies at the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nA small Stanford University study published in August suggested that ketamine may help relieve depression by activating the brain’s opioid receptors.\n\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals and Allergan are among drug companies developing ketamine-like drugs for depression. Janssen leads the effort with its nasal spray esketamine. The company filed a new drug application in September.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of studies are underway seeking to answer some of the unknowns about ketamine including whether repeat IV treatments work better for depression and if there’s a way to zero in on which patients are most likely to benefit.\n\nUntil there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner .\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

But most of those fears are related to the use of a combination of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which are prescribed to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and have been shown to increase a woman’s risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women’s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. Nationwide, about one-third of women in their 50s have had a hysterectomy.\n\nThe Women’s Health Initiative was begun in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health as a sweeping investigation of hormone use and other health issues of postmenopausal women.\n\n\n\nWhile most women in the hormone study were taking combination hormone therapy, women without a uterus took estrogen alone or a placebo for about six years and were followed for nearly 11 years. The estrogen-only group was not given progestin, which is prescribed only to protect the uterus from the harmful effects of estrogen. Although all the women in the estrogen study stopped using the treatment in 2004, the investigators have continued to monitor their health, as is typical in large clinical trials.\n\nThe most surprising new finding relates to breast cancer. The women with hysterectomies who used estrogen alone had a 23 percent lower risk for breast cancer compared with those who had taken a placebo. This is in stark contrast to the higher risk of breast cancer shown in the estrogen-progestin part of the trial.\n\n“The decreased risk of breast cancer in this group is something we totally didn’t expect when we started the W.H.I. hormone therapy trials,” said Andrea Z. LaCroix, the study’s lead author and a professor of epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. “This study differentiates estrogen alone from estrogen and progestin in a very big way. I hope it gets across to women, because we are not reversing ourselves.”\n\nIndeed, the investigators emphasized that the results do not change recommendations concerning combination hormone therapy for the two-thirds of menopausal women who still have a uterus. The Women’s Health Initiative data have consistently shown that the combination of estrogen and progestin raises breast cancer risk, and that the treatment should be used only to relieve severe menopause symptoms, using the lowest dose for the shortest possible time.\n\nBut the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.\n\nAn accompanying editorial in the journal was skeptical about the results, arguing that the design of the initiative, which is skewed toward older women and stopped all forms of hormone treatment after several years of use, does not match the way doctors typically prescribe treatment to women in their 50s at the onset of menopause.\n\nDr. Graham Colditz, an author of the editorial and professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he thought data collected from observational studies that show a higher risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen use were more reliable than the data gathered from the Women’s Health Initiative clinical trial.\n\n“The finding doesn’t reflect how hormones are used in the U.S. at the moment,” Dr. Colditz said.\n\nThe trial has, however, been held up for years as the gold standard for medical research, and its findings linking combination hormones to breast cancer and heart problems led to significant changes in the way doctors around the world treated menopause.\n\nA major caveat in interpreting the new estrogen data is that the study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are estrogen compounds derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the brand Premarin. The brand has fallen out of favor with many women who are choosing treatments that contain estradiol, which is chemically similar to a woman’s natural estrogen. It is not known whether the benefits of estrogen shown in the Women’s Health Initiative would be replicated using a different type of estrogen.\n\nNobody knows why estrogen treatment alone appeared to lower breast cancer risk in the study, but one explanation may be that in menopausal women with low levels of natural estrogen, the effects of estrogen drugs induce cell death in existing tumors. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease.\n\n“We need to look closely at these findings to see if we can learn more about ways to prevent breast cancer in women,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Women’s Health Initiative investigator and an author of the study who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nIn the final analysis of the estrogen-only trial, use of the hormone was not associated with any significant risks or benefits pertaining to blood clots, stroke, hip fracture, colon cancer or overall death rates.\n\nBut there were surprising differences in the risks and benefits of estrogen use on heart risk when comparing the youngest and oldest women in the study. Women who were in their 50s when they first started using estrogen also had significantly fewer heart risks, including almost 50 percent fewer heart attacks, compared with those assigned to the placebo group.\n\nThe data indicate that for every 10,000 women in their 50s, those using estrogen would experience 12 fewer heart attacks, 13 fewer deaths and 18 fewer adverse events like blood clots or stroke in a given year, compared with those taking a placebo.\n\nBut the risks of estrogen use were pronounced in older women. For every 10,000 women in their 70s, using estrogen would cause 16 extra heart attacks, 19 extra deaths and 48 serious adverse events.\n\n“The big message there is that the data look much more favorable for younger women and much riskier for older women,” said Dr. LaCroix.\n\nDr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman’s health status, her age and the type of hormone used.\n\nDr. Chlebowski previously led research that showed cancer risks associated with combination hormone therapy, but he says the new data on estrogen alone show that in certain women, estrogen use to relieve menopausal symptoms is a “good choice.”\n\n“When you look at the debate, people are saying hormones are good or not good — it’s been all or nothing. This calls attention to the fact that there are differences,” Dr. Chlebowski said. “I hope that separation will become clearer now.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article appeared in print on Wednesday, April 6, 2011 on page A1.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Careful reporting of a medical journal article that gives consumers plenty of nuance to chew over.</span>","The New York Times provides vital context for this discussion of estrogen use after menopause.

To its credit, the story acknowledges that there’s no published research behind this treatment and quotes an independent dermatologist saying she can’t recommend the product to patients. It helpfully reports that the company differentiates itself by selecting customers who are likely to comply with the time-consuming treatment regime and by tracking customers’ hair growth, along with the fact that positive results may stem from the fact that most customers are women, who can lose hair due to hormonal changes and see it grow back naturally, without treatment.

Of the 12 AML patients who received this experimental T-cell therapy after a transplant put their disease in remission, all are still in remission after a median follow-up of more than two years.\n\nGiving these cells when disease is in remission after transplant ""might actually be helping patients who have a high risk of relapsing to not relapse down the line,"" said Dr. Aude Chapuis, cancer physician and immunotherapy researcher at Fred Hutch, one of the study\'s leaders. Chapuis presented these results at the 2016 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in San Diego, California.\n\nThe findings in this group of trial participants contrast with the outcomes the researchers observed in a cohort of similar patients who received transplants around the same time but did not receive engineered T cells. In all of these transplant-only patients, the transplants produced remissions, but more than a quarter of them relapsed within just 10 months.\n\nIn the experimental T-cell therapy tested in this trial, certain T cells from each patient\'s transplant donor were genetically engineered to produce receptors that allowed the T cells to recognize, very specifically, a target molecule called WT1. WT1 is 10 to 1,000 times more common in leukemia cells than their noncancerous cousins, making it a natural target for therapies designed to destroy cancer cells while leaving most healthy cells alone.\n\nThis is the team\'s first trial of this strategy, which was initially developed in the lab of Dr. Phil Greenberg, one of the study\'s leaders and the head of Fred Hutch\'s Program in Immunology. Because it was the first study of this particular approach, the researchers focused on a high-risk group -- AML patients undergoing bone marrow transplant who had certain genetic or disease characteristics that decrease the chance of long-term transplant success -- ""a hard population of patients,"" Chapuis said, many of whom ""were horribly sick.""\n\nEach patient\'s therapy was created just for them in a specialized Fred Hutch facility. Certain T cells from each patient\'s matched donor were given the genetic instructions to make a receptor that specifically reacts to WT1. Then came a blood stem cell transplant: Patients\' leukemic bone marrow and blood cells were destroyed and replaced with healthy cells from their donors. A month later, when the team examined these 12 patients\' marrow, they found no trace of the cancers. Rapidly thereafter, once the transplanted cells fully engrafted, each patient then received up to 10 billion of the genetically engineered donor cells, infused into their arm through an IV.\n\nChapuis\'s role in this trial is on the laboratory side of the research, ensuring the quality of the genetically engineered cell products and monitoring the activity of the cells after infusion. She co-leads this research with Greenberg and Dr. Dan Egan of Fred Hutch, the trial\'s principal investigator and the care provider for trial participants. The study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health and spinoff Juno Therapeutics, of which Greenberg is a scientific co-founder.\n\nOutside of this trial, Chapuis treats cancer patients at Fred Hutch\'s clinical care partner, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Watching her patients undergo bone marrow transplant ? itself the first clear and reproducible example of cancer immunotherapy, developed at Fred Hutch ? has made her want to work toward something better.\n\n""That\'s my source of inspiration. I\'m always horrified by the intense treatment that we inflict on bone marrow transplant patients and the hardship that we make them go through. And I really think we can do better,"" Chapuis said. ""That\'s why I\'m doing this.""\n\n###\n\nAt Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch\'s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer with minimal side effects. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation\'s first and largest cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women\'s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Private contributions are essential for enabling Fred Hutch scientists to explore novel research opportunities that lead to important medical breakthroughs. For more information, visit fredhutch.org or follow Fred Hutch on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube.']","A discussion of surrogate endpoints (in this case, relapse rates) versus survival would have made this release more complete.","This release about a small trial of immunotherapy applied to a dozen leukemia patients who are at unusually high risk of relapse leaps to premature interpretations and inflates the meaning of the results far beyond the limited guidance for future research that this sort of study can offer.
It inappropriately elevates the importance of relapse rates, implying that they predict vital outcomes, such as survival or quality life improvements, which this trial did not measure. Even as it puffs up the potential benefits, the release neglects to note either the short-term harms reported by researchers in their scientific conference abstract or the potential life-threatening harms that immunotherapy may expose patients to. The release doesn’t provide context for how these trial results relate to  existing or other experimental treatments, and it makes makes only an oblique reference to the personal financial stakes of a lead researcher. It does not make any reference to cost, even though recently-approved immunotherapy treatments suggest the price tag could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
On the positive side, the release does a good job of explaining why adjuvant treatment to enhance the immune system after bone marrow transplant may be necessary in certain leukemia patients.

Joseph McGlynn suffered a stroke that seriously impaired his left side, also five years ago.\n\nUsing technology designed by Case Western Reserve University and the Advanced Platform Technology and Functional Electrical Stimulation centers at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the two men got their feet back under them.\n\nTwo studies, published in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, show that functional electrical stimulation (FES) significantly helped McGlynn and Bush to effectively walk at the medical center.\n\n""I went in there and I could barely take two steps,"" said Bush, 42, who researchers believe is the world\'s first MS patient to ""test-drive"" an implanted FES system. The proof-of-feasibility test lasted 90 days. ""At the end,"" said Bush, of Columbus, Ohio, ""I was walking down the hallway. To me, it was monumental."" A video of him walking with and without the system can be found at: https:/ / youtu. be/ 17JYaKkdRYs .\n\nMcGlynn, 69, of North Royalton, Ohio, could walk with a cane, but not easily. With the technology switched on, he covered far more ground and his pace was twice as fast during his 30-week study.\n\n""It\'s helped with balance and confidence,"" said McGlynn, who used to tread a lot of stairs maintaining equipment at a steel plant. ""I\'m confident now that I can walk without stumbling and falling."" A video of him walking with and without aid of the system can be found here: https:/ / youtu. be/ 3CYq-FSFQLM .\n\nNathan Makowski, an investigator at the Cleveland FES Center, created by Case Western Reserve and the Cleveland VA, said that FES technology has been used primarily for therapy in stroke patients in the past. ""This, though, is a more long-term assistive system,"" he said.\n\nAddressing needs\n\nThe researchers hope these studies will lay the foundation for implanted systems that restore some independence to people with MS or who have suffered a stroke.\n\nTheir numbers are substantial. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society estimates that more than 2.3 million people have the disease worldwide. Surveys have found that 93 percent suffer gait impairment within 10 years of diagnosis and 13 percent report they are unable to walk twice a week. Other research has found that 6 million to 7 million people live with stroke nationally and nearly 30 percent require assistance to walk.\n\n""In both cases, there is a disconnect between the brain and muscles,"" said Stephen Selkirk, MD, a neurologist at the VA\'s Spinal Cord Injury Division and assistant professor of neurology at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. ""This system replaces the lost connection.""\n\nThe system includes implanted electrodes that tie into nerves that control muscles collectively, called hip and knee flexors and ankle dorsoflexors. In healthy people, the muscles work in seamless coordination each step they take.\n\nWhen Bush or McGlynn walks, he pushes a button on an external controller, which sends signals to a pulse generator, which then sends electrical pulses to the electrodes. The pulses stimulate the nerves, which in turn stimulate the muscles in both of Bush\'s legs and McGlynn\'s left leg.\n\n""Both guys were taking steps the first time we turned the systems on,"" said Ron Triolo, a professor of orthopaedics and biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve and executive director of the Advanced Platform Technology (APT) Center. ""When Robert Bush took a step, it wasn\'t\' pretty, but we saw the potential.""\n\nIn each patient, ""the pulses are sent in a pattern that is close to how normal muscles work,"" said Rudi Kobetic, a principal investigator at the Stokes Cleveland VA and APT Center. ""We try to time the pattern to stimulation so that it\'s integrated with their ability. Similar to regular physical therapy, we can see results.""\n\nSignificant improvement\n\nBoth men gained strength and endurance through repeated use of the systems and fine-tuning by the researchers.\n\nBush went from the two steps to consistently walking more than 30 yards during the trial. In that time, he used a walker to help maintain his balance.\n\n""When they turned it on the first time, I was surprised how well it worked,"" said Bush, who had to give up his construction career due to the disease. ""I lifted my knee like I was high-stepping. Once we got it fine-tuned and I got walking, I thought it was amazing. I still think it\'s amazing.""\n\nMcGlynn\'s gait became noticeably more symmetrical and energetic, the researchers said. His gait without the system was about 19 yards per minute; with the system, 47 yards per minute. Training with the system improved McGlynn\'s speed when it was turned off to 23 yards per minute, indicating therapeutic benefit.\n\n""Distance is a challenge,"" he said. Initially, he could walk 83 yards but improved to 1,550 yards--nearly a mile--at the faster gait. ""I work up a good sweat and that makes me feel good,"" he said.\n\nDue to his improvements, the research team is developing a system that McGlynn can use at home and outside.\n\n""I\'ll be able to walk for exercise and hopefully be able to walk into church and into a restaurant,"" McGlynn said.\n\nWhen Bush\'s trial ended, surgeons removed his implanted electrodes. The researchers are seeking funding to fit him with a permanent FES system in a clinical trial.\n\nIn the meantime, Bush is now back to using a wheelchair but working to maintain his strength and flexibility, repeatedly standing and sitting while holding onto a rail or standing for long periods of time. ""I\'m keeping things ready for when they get the green light,"" he said.\n\n###\n\nOther researchers who contributed to the two studies are the APT Center\'s Lisa Lombardo, physical therapist; Kevin Foglyano, biomedical engineer; and Gilles Pinault, MD, a surgeon and co-director of the center.']","Short-term case studies of two patients, even very encouraging ones, don’t equal effective treatment for broad populations of patients, and the news release needed to spell that out.","Functional electrical stimulation illustration by Milos R Popovic – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=48016117
Just two patients — one with multiple sclerosis and one with paralysis from a stroke — participated in these studies on the feasibility of using implanted electrodes to restore the ability to walk.
Although it’s exciting so see assistive technology helping individuals, isolated short-term successes in a lab don’t equate to an effective treatment for broad populations of patients, but this news release from Case Western Reserve University doesn’t deliver that caution strongly enough. Nor does it discuss costs, offer comparisons with other treatment options, or explain potential risks with this technology, which was developed with the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The news release nicely describes how this technology affected these two patients, including videos showing them walking with and without the electronic stimulation.

Since then, clinicians and dermatologists have seen a rise in demand for minimally invasive laser-based treatments, including tattoo removal. However, it is difficult for the laser light, which is held at a distance from the skin, to be perfectly and selectively absorbed by only the targeted birthmark or tattoo. Now, researchers from the University of Missouri have developed instruments that transmit laser light into the tissue through direct contact. The techniques developed by the interdisciplinary team can be used by dermatologists and will reduce safety concerns in laser dermatology by improving laser transmission through surface layers of the skin.\n\nLaser techniques come with risks, including eye damage. Open-air transmission, in which the clinician holds the laser at a distance from the patient, is typical during normal dermatological procedures and presents a hazard to both the patients’ and doctors’ eyes. Paul J.D. Whiteside, a doctoral candidate in the MU Division of Food Systems and Bioengineering, devised a system that will not only improve the process, but will be safer for both clinicians and patients.\n\n“The system we developed uses ultrasonic pulsation in conjunction with a clinical laser to alter the properties of skin tissues during the procedure,” Whiteside said. “We’ve named the technique ‘sonoillumination,’ and we’re hopeful that the procedure will be available widely in the near future.”\n\nWhiteside and his team, including adviser, Heather K. Hunt, an assistant professor of bioengineering in the MU College of Engineering, tested the sonoillumination system on porcine skin tissue samples. Using various amplitudes and pulses, the instruments they developed were tested on the samples and showed great promise for the clinical setting. Whiteside presented his technique to clinicians on April 9, 2017, at the annual conference of American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS).\n\n“Pork skin samples are very close to human skin samples, so the initial results we saw are promising for human applications,” Hunt said. “‘Sonoillumination’ will be extremely beneficial for clinicians and the ASLMS presentation allowed us to demonstrate the system to the people who actually will be using the technology once it’s commercialized.”\n\nNicholas Golda, associate professor of dermatology and director of dermatology surgery at the MU School of Medicine, echoed the merits of the sonoillumination system and the effect it will have on dermatology.\n\n“Our goal is to provide patients with safer, more effective treatment options that potentially lower the number of treatments needed,” Golda said. “This new technology may also provide physicians with a safer, more controllable option for treating patients.”\n\nThe team co-authored the paper, “Ultrasonic modulation of tissue optical properties in ex vivo porcine skin to improve transmitted transdermal laser intensity,” which recently was accepted for publication by the society’s journal, Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. The sonoillumination research was funded in part by a 2015 Fast Track grant from the University of Missouri System.\n\nThe team is in the planning stages of developing a start-up company to commercialize the technique. Products produced by Whiteside and the team highlight the University’s impact on the state’s economic development efforts, including commercialization of research conducted at Mizzou, workforce development and job growth, quality of life improvements for residents, and attracting corporations and businesses to the state. Over the last five years, companies commercializing MU technologies have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and grants to advance their commercialization efforts. In 2016, the Office of Technology Management and Industry Relations reported that Mizzou received $14.9 million in revenue from more than 40 technology licenses.\n\nThe MU bioengineering department is jointly affiliated with College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR) and the College of Engineering.\n\nEditor’s Note: For more information on the patent application for sonoillumination, please see: https://www.google.com/patents/US20150351841']",Sensational terms like “revolutionized” are inapplicable when used to describe a new treatment that has yet to be tested on humans.,"This news release claims that a device being developed at the University of Missouri could revolutionize treatment to remove tattoos, birth marks and port-wine stains based only on a test on some pig skin…and that pig didn’t even have any tattoos or other markings.
The release quotes a researcher who hopes “the procedure will be available widely in the near future.” But there’s no evidence to support that statement either. While the release is peppered with claims that this device that combines laser light with ultrasound pulses will be safer and more effective, that’s not what the experiment tested. The researchers showed only that their device was able to push more laser light through a piece of pig skin than a conventional laser. Their assumption that increasing transmitted optical power will improve clinical effectiveness has yet to be tested. Neither benefits nor harms are put in numerical context. Alternatives are not mentioned. We applaud the release writers for including a link to a patent application, which provides more detail about the device and highlights potential benefits to the researchers. The release notes that the work was funded by a program to support commercialization of academic research.

Several recent studies have shown that even a single dose in adults can lead to rapid reductions in depressive symptoms. However, relatively little research has been conducted into ketamine\'s antidepressant effects in adolescents.\n\n“Adolescence is a key time period for emergence of depression and represents an opportune and critical developmental window for intervention to prevent negative outcomes,” the authors wrote in the study.\n\n“Unfortunately, about 40% of adolescents do not respond to their first intervention and only half of non-responders respond to the second treatment,” they said. “Because standard interventions require prolonged periods (e.g., weeks to months) to assess efficacy, serial treatment failures allow illness progression, which in turn worsens the outcome. Hence, novel treatment strategies to address treatment-resistant depression in adolescents are urgently needed.”\n\nThe latest study involved thirteen young people aged between 12 and 18 years of age who had failed two previous trials of anti-depressants. Over two weeks the researchers gave them six ketamine infusions.\n\nThey found that the treatment was well tolerated, with the participants showing an average decrease in CDRS scores of 42.5%. Five of the participants met the criteria for clinical response and remission. Of these, three were still in remission after 6-weeks, while the remaining two relapsed within two weeks.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nAccording to the scientists, the results demonstrate the potential role for ketamine in treating adolescents with TRD. However, they note that the study was limited by its small sample size, so future research will be needed to confirm these results.\n\n""The field is excited about a potential new agent for adolescents with treatment resistant depression,” Harold S. Koplewicz, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology said in a statement. “We look forward to additional studies of ketamine to validate this treatment.”\n\nQuestions also remain regarding the long-term safety of ketamine as a depression treatment, so more information will be needed before broader clinical use.\n\niStock\n\nJames Stone, a Clinical Senior Lecturer from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King\'s College London, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek that there is ""a lot of potential for the use of ketamine as a second or third line antidepressant where other treatments have failed.""\n\n""Although ketamine is potentially a huge breakthrough in the treatment of depression, we still don’t know about the long-term safety, or about how to keep people well from depression without requiring regular ketamine dosing,"" Stone added. ""Further studies are needed to address these questions.""']",And potential harms weren’t spelled out — particularly important when it comes to the unknown effects of long-term use on developing brains and bodies.,"This story reported on a preliminary study looking at whether the drug ketamine might be a potential treatment for adolescent depression.  The story refrained from disease-mongering and quantified the scope of the observed benefits.
However, the headline and lead were misleading in stating that teens who took the drug had improvements in their depression. The word “promise” used in the headline wasn’t borne out by the data. In fact, the study wasn’t designed to offer reliable evidence that the drug offers a benefit. Caveats about the study were included only toward the end of the story, and readers were left in the dark about ketamine’s potential for misuse and its potential side effects. Costs were also missing.

For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don’t have access to genetic tests at all.\n\nThat’s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient’s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.\n\nSome older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners — a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.\n\nMeanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.\n\nIt’s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics’ systemic blind spots.\n\nDiagnoses vs. probabilities\n\nThe algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They’re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.\n\nBut they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall “look” of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won’t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, “Does my patient have a genetic disorder?”\n\nThat’s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases — a means to an end.\n\n“We are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,” said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.\n\nDrawing that bright line between Face2Gene and “a diagnostic tool” allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.\n\nDiversity needed\n\nThe algorithm the NIH uses — developed by scientists at Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C., — seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.\n\nFace2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. “Since Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,” Gelbman cautioned.\n\nBut there’s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.\n\n“In every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,” Muenke said. “When I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren’t. There just aren’t.” (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH’s work.)\n\nSo diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn’t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. “We have thought about it but haven’t gone there yet,” Muenke said.\n\nFor example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges — as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome — the angles between landmark points on the child’s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children’s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other “typical” features weren’t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.\n\nIn fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. “One of the findings that I’m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,” Linguraru said.\n\nTo continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients’ faces — but that’s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH’s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.\n\nThose numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. “Most practitioners are located in North America and Europe,” Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn’t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.\n\nIt’s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH’s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 “skinny” budget proposal announced in March.)\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nFor now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm’s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAs both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients.""]","It’s also difficult to understand the “market” for this startup if most patients in the U.S. have access to genetic testing, which is needed for an actual diagnosis","This is a story that has a lot of good reporting, but by focusing on one company in the facial-recognition field, it leaves too many questions unanswered. The possibilities with facial recognition software are profound, and yet we don’t know from this story whether they truly could be used effectively for identifying and treating disease or whether they will be relegated mainly to sideshow status.

The first pregnancy from a frozen egg occurred in 1986.\n\nBut it’s been only in the past few years that fertility specialists have begun freezing eggs with any regularity — so short a time that two major professional groups, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, still consider egg freezing experimental. They caution that a request to freeze eggs should be considered by an institutional review board before being granted.\n\nFreezing eggs for non-medical reasons — a healthy woman choosing to harvest and preserve her eggs for conceiving a baby sometime in the future — is new enough that there are few reliable statistics on how successful the procedure is. “Success’’ in such cases means a take-home baby, not just an egg that is frozen without damage, or thawed safely, or even fertilized to yield a genetically normal, healthy embryo.\n\n“So few women who have frozen eggs have come back to use them [that it’s impossible] to quote a clear pregnancy rate on it,’’ says Dr. Elizabeth Ginsburg, medical director of assisted reproductive technologies at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. There hasn’t been time to collect enough data, since women usually plan to freeze eggs for many months or years before retrieving them for conception.\n\nBut the idea is clearly catching on. Nationwide, roughly half of 282 US fertility centers surveyed offer egg freezing, according to researchers at the University of Southern California, who conducted the study and published findings last month in Fertility and Sterility, a journal of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. There are about 400 fertility centers in the United States.\n\nEgg freezing, not usually covered by insurance, can cost $10,000 or more per procedure.

The results appear in the journal Cancer Research.\n\nOne difficult but crucial determination for surgeons and tissue pathologists is figuring out where a tumor ends. A solid tumor may be easily identifiable, but the tissue around the main body of the tumor, known as the margin, may contain cancerous cells as well. Because of this, excess tissue surrounding the tumor is typically removed, but the question lingers of whether any cancer cells remain to re-emerge later as tumors.\n\n""In almost all solid-tumor surgeries, there\'s a question of margins,"" said Dr. Boppart, who also is a medical doctor. ""Typically, surgeons will remove the tissue mass that contains the tumor and will send it to the lab. The pathologist will process, section and stain the tissue, then examine the thin sections on microscope slides. They look at the structure of the cells and other features of the tissue. The diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted. This is what we call the gold standard for diagnosis.""\n\nThe new device is a hand-held probe based on a technology called optical coherence tomography (OCT) that uses light to image tissue in real time. Cancer cells and normal tissue scatter light differently because they have different microstructural and molecular features, Boppart said, so OCT gives physicians a way to quantitatively measure the cellular feature of a tumor. Surgeons can pass the OCT wand over a section of tissue and see a video on a screen, with no special chemical stains or lengthy tissue processing required.\n\n""In many cases, you can\'t tell the difference between cancer cells and normal tissue with the naked eye, but with OCT they\'re very different,"" said Boppart, who also is affiliated with the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the U. of I.\n\nIn the clinical study, surgeons treated patients according to the standard surgical procedure, but OCT data were collected from the margin of the tumor cavity and the margin of the removed tissue mass during surgery so that the results could be compared later. The study found that the OCT device analysis identified the differences between normal and cancerous tissue with 92 percent sensitivity and 92 percent specificity. They also found that the way that OCT spotted cancer in the removed tissue was closely correlated with the results from the postoperative pathology reports, which often came days later.\n\n""For the first time, this study demonstrates the use of OCT for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity, in the patient, during surgery,"" Boppart said. ""It is likely better to check to see if any residual tumor cells might be left behind, rather than checking the tissue mass that was taken out. Then, the surgeon can intervene immediately.""\n\nThe researchers will continue clinical studies with the OCT device, looking at other types of solid-state tumors. Diagnostic Photonics, a start-up company Boppart co-founded that also collaborated on the study, is commercializing the OCT probe technology for broader use.\n\n""Ultimately, new technological innovations like this in medicine and surgery are going to improve our health care and save lives. That\'s when this work will be most rewarding,"" Boppart said.\n\n###\n\nThe National Institutes of Health supported this work.\n\nEditor\'s notes: Editor\'s note: To reach Stephen Boppart, call 217-244-7479; email: boppart@illinois.edu.']",Pretty good account of an early study about a new device.

This news release describes the results of a small clinical “proof of concept” trial designed to blind-test the reliability and accuracy (i.e. sensitivity and specificity) of a hand-held light-only probe that surgeons might use to accurately determine how much tissue beyond a visible tumor should be removed during cancer surgery to help contain the disease. The release does a praiseworthy job of pointing out right away that the goal of the study was to measure the performance of the instrument, called an optical coherence tomography (OCT) device, against the “gold standard” practice of surgically collecting tissue from both the tumor and the “margins” around the tumor cavity, and sending both to a pathology lab for definitive diagnosis and evidence  that surgeons “got it all.” The release would have benefited from more information about the sensitivity and specificity of the results among the patient groups. And it didn’t describe what it is, exactly, that OCT identifies — i.e. the mixed and disorganized microscopic tissue structures that are the markers of malignancy. But overall, the release does make clear the potential of the technology without over-promising a timetable for clinical use. And it does an admirable job of disclosing the financial interest in commercialization of the device by one of the investigators. Readers will be mostly well informed by this release.

This version has been updated.\n\nHip replacement involves removing the joint — the damaged bone and cartilage — and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal, plastic or ceramics. In a break from past practice, some surgeons prefer to cut into the joint from the front. (ANTHONY UNGER/ANTHONY UNGER)\n\nOver the past two decades, the number of Americans having total hip replacements has more than doubled, to more than 300,000 a year. Though most patients eventually walk again without pain or the aid of a cane, recovery and rehabilitation can be rigorous, painful and lengthy.\n\nThe surgery is extensive: As its name suggests, it involves removing the joint — the damaged bone and cartilage — and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal, plastic or ceramics. Typically, surgeons enter the joint from the rear, which requires cutting through muscle and cartilage. But with a relatively new procedure, surgeons enter from the front and only stretch the muscles aside, avoiding the cutting and minimizing pain and recovery time. According to those who use this anterior technique, the benefits are substantial.\n\nAnthony Unger, medical director at the Institute of Bone and Joint Health at Sibley Memorial Hospital and a clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at George Washington University Hospital, says the anterior approach is “truly minimally invasive.” Unger, who has done about 4,000 hip replacements over 26 years and has used the anterior technique for the past eight years, says “patients have better overall functionality, can sleep on their sides and be confident the new hip won’t dislocate.”\n\nBut, as with many transitions in medical techniques, some surgeons have been reluctant to change. Although agencies and hospitals don’t track hip replacements by the type of procedure used, Unger says that, based on statistics from the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, only 20 percent of its members choose the anterior approach.\n\nJoshua Jacobs, a vice president of the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons and chairman of orthopedic surgery at Rush University in Chicago, says the AAOS doesn’t “endorse or promote one specific technique or procedure over another.” Jacobs prefers the posterior approach, which he says has been reliable for him.\n\nHe says that while he’s heard about the benefits of the anterior approach, he’s “not aware of a randomized, controlled trial comparing the posterior and anterior approach that shows a definite superiority of one over the other.” What’s key is that “surgeons need to do the approach they’re most comfortable with to get the best outcomes.”\n\nTeetering ‘like Chaplin’\n\nA study by Unger in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery in 2011 found that with the anterior procedure, there was less muscle damage and inflammation both in the immediate postoperative period and two days later than with the posterior approach.\n\nOthers surgeons who prefer the anterior procedure say it preserves more of the normal anatomy, which also means fewer medications and shorter hospital stays. Michael Bollinger, who operates at Palm Drive Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif., switched methods a few years ago.\n\nWith the anterior approach, Bollinger says, “we can take\n\nX-rays during the operation, to see if the new hip is placed correctly and adjust it, when necessary.” Many surgeons use a special operating table that makes this possible.\n\nAlthough surgeons can also take X-rays during the posterior procedure, it is much more difficult, and they wait until patients are in the recovery room, where, Bollinger says, “there’s not much that can be done.” He explains that while the body “tolerates an imperfect alignment pretty well, if a new hip gets dislocated, it’s often because it’s not in perfectly.”\n\nThe anterior approach offers other benefits.\n\nRobert Saunders, a nurse at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif., sees about 200 hip replacement patients a year. He says that “nurses love the anterior approach” because there’s less worry about dislocating the joint. “With the posterior approach, we have to spread patients’ legs apart and strap them to a pillow to keep the new joint in place. If they want to move or roll over, they can’t,” he says.\n\nSaunders says the anterior patients also have an easier time with physical therapy, which can start the same day as the surgery. “Those who’ve had the posterior procedure have a lot of pain, since, when they sit up, they’re right on top the incision,” he explains.\n\nPatrick Kennelly, a physical therapist with Smartherapy in Chevy Chase, says people who have the anterior procedure “don’t feel so weak, because their hip muscles haven’t been cut. If they’ve had the posterior procedure, even if they don’t consciously feel weak, they tend to shift their weight onto one foot and teeter like [Charlie] Chaplin.”\n\nCautious surgeons\n\nGiven benefits such as these, why haven’t more surgeons switched methods? Unger says that most surgeons have used the posterior approach for years, have fine results, and see no need to switch. Also, he says, they work in a “very high-stress, high-liability environment. For this reason, new techniques are adapted slowly with extreme care, and in some cases, not at all.”\n\nUnger adds that surgeons are naturally cautious and typically wait to see results from many studies before they switch methods. Besides his study, there have only been a few others. One, a prospective, randomized study by William Barrett, an orthopedic surgeon in the Seattle area, compared the two approaches in a peer-reviewed paper he presented at the 2012 annual AAOS meeting and found benefits with the anterior approach.\n\nAnother obstacle to the widespread use of the newer approach is that if established surgeons want to switch, they face time and cost constraints. They must get training in classes and cadaver labs, and the learning curve can be steep. Unger says his was relatively short — about 20 cases. Others say it took about 50 cases.\n\nAnd this creates economic issues. “If you’re a busy surgeon, you have a volume to maintain,” Bollinger says, “and it’s hard to go from doing three a day to one during the learning period.”\n\nChristopher Chen, a surgeon who uses the anterior approach at Alta Bates Summit, adds that most doctors “still use the posterior approach because it’s the one they were taught.” And, he says, the majority of younger surgeons learn the older approach because established surgeons are typically the ones who staff the residency training programs and demonstrate the method they know best.\n\nMost surgeons don’t profit from choosing one approach over another, Chen says. “If there is a financial incentive” for promoting the newer technique, he says, “it is that more patients will want the anterior approach, so that the surgeon does more surgeries, and therefore collects more professional fees for that.”\n\nWilliam Hamilton, who operates at the Anderson Orthopaedic Clinic at Inova Mt. Vernon Hospital, trains young surgeons to do the anterior approach in a year-long hip and knee replacement fellowship program. Hamilton says that “during this time, they’re taught both approaches.” But he adds that “since 2009, of the 13 fellows he trained, 12 use the anterior procedure as their primary approach in their practices.”\n\nHamilton says that “a decade ago, very few residencies and fellowships taught the anterior approach. Now, several institutions around the country have at least one surgeon teaching it. So when students leave and begin their practices, it’s no longer foreign to them.”\n\nHamilton, who has performed 1,100 anterior procedures and strongly supports the method, says that despite growing interest, “it will take a generation of new surgeons” before use of the anterior approach is widespread.\n\nPatients aren’t informed\n\nMany patients aren’t aware of the option. The case of Daniel Ellsberg — who in 1971 released the Pentagon Papers, a secret study about U.S. involvement in Vietnam — is instructive. His hip had been hurting for about a year, and when he decided to have surgery, his primary-care physician recommended a respected surgeon. Just days before the operation last July, a friend told him about the anterior approach.\n\n“I’d never heard of it, and neither my doctor nor surgeon mentioned it. I called the surgeon’s office, learned he did the posterior procedure, asked for and got a recommendation for one who performs the anterior one, and my experience was amazing. The same day as the operation, I walked down the hall with a walker. I was home in three days, and a week later, [I] walked one or two blocks without pain or a cane. In a month, I bodysurfed at the beach,” says Ellsberg, who is 81 .\n\nMargot Machol, who is two decades younger and lives in Washington, had both hips replaced — the first with the posterior procedure several years ago, the second with the anterior procedure last October. Unger performed both surgeries.\n\n“After the first, I needed pain medicine when I came home from the hospital. Also, I had a long list of restrictions of what I could and couldn’t do so the hip wouldn’t pop out. For six weeks, I had to sleep on my back, couldn’t cross my legs and wasn’t able to drive.\n\n“After the second, I didn’t take any pain pills once I was home, slept on my side soon after the surgery, had almost no rules and drove my car in two weeks. I even wanted to ski over Christmas, because I felt fine,” Machol says.\n\nKoeppel is a writer based in Washington.']","The story feels like a conversation among a lot of very smart people explaining hip surgery in a very compelling way, so compelling that you might miss the lack of evidence for the new method being touted in this story.","The descriptions in this story are well crafted, and the attempt to bring in a variety of voices about hip replacement should be commended. Ultimately, though, we were left with a big question mark about why this method of surgery was being promoted at this time. A careful reader might note that the headline could be applied to nearly any new  medical technique. “New method for hip replacement wins favor with some surgeons” could easily be “new method for tummy tucks wins favor with some surgeons” or “new method for prostate removal wins favor with some surgeons.” There always will be “some surgeons” who favor one technique over another. That doesn’t make the technique worth promoting for free in a prestigious newspaper.

This cancer trap can be used for early diagnosis and treatment of metastasized cancer.\n\n“Our cancer trap works just like a roach motel, where you put in some bait and the roach goes there and dies,” said Liping Tang, UTA bioengineering professor and leader of the research. “We are putting biological agents in a cancer trap to attract and kill cancer cells.\n\n“This method is effective for both diagnosing and treating metastasis cancer and can be used in combination with traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy,” he added.\n\nCurrently, there are many treatments for primary tumors but they do little to prevent metastasis and stray cancer cells from relocating to another part of the body. Surgical removal of cancerous tissue also can spur the spread of cancer in the body. While there are drugs given to patients after surgery to prevent cancer cells from adhering to each other or other tissues, these drugs do not rid the body of cancer cells or collect them to allow an assessment of the patient’s status.\n\n“We have made a nano-sized device that we can put under the skin using an injection needle to recruit the cancer cells into a small area where we can treat them with less overall side effects to the whole body,” Tang said.\n\n“So the cancer trap is really complementary to current cancer treatments and especially beneficial at the early stages when it is difficult to see if the cancer is spreading as there are few cancer cells. We have also found it very effective in late stage cancers to stop the spread of the disease and to prolong lifespan,” he added.\n\nLiping Tang, UTA bioengineering professor and inventor of the cancer trap\n\nThe cancer trap works by releasing different chemokines or regulatory proteins to attract circulating cancer cells and then expose them to chemotherapeutic agents to eradicate potential spreading. The trap has been tested in the lab and proved effective on many kinds of cancer cells, including melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia and esophageal cancer.\n\n“We are hoping to move toward clinical trials in the next few years as this technology could potentially significantly increase the lifespan of cancer patients,” Tang said.\n\nThis work on cancer forms part of a larger program at UTA where more than 30 faculty from different colleges and disciplines are developing new solutions to attack this disease.\n\nWith more than $4 million in research expenditures in 2017, UTA’s program for cancer encompasses basic cancer research, identification and diagnostics, as well as in noninvasive, midterm, invasive and postoperative therapies. UTA’s multidisciplinary research teams harness proficiencies from across science, engineering, computer science, nursing and kinesiology to tackle the challenges of precision oncology and cancer treatment.\n\nTang’s expertise encompasses a broad area, including stem cells, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, biocompatibility, biomaterials, inflammation, infection and fibrosis. He has published much of his work in high impact journals, including Biomaterials, Journal of Clinical Investigation, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Blood, Journal of Experimental Medicine, and Tissue Engineering.\n\n“Tang is a remarkable innovator and internationally recognized researcher,” said Michael Cho, UTA’s chair of bioengineering. “His work is a clear example of UTA’s strategic focus on health and the human condition and of the strength of multidisciplinary work.”']","Based on the information in the release, the device appears to be — at this point — little more than a concept.","This news release announces the European patent for a medical device that is designed to attract, trap and kill cancer cells.

Common warning signs include snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. One treatment option for sleep apnea is PAP therapy, which uses mild levels of air pressure, provided through a mask, to keep the throat open while you sleep.\n\nThe study involved 2,027 patients with sleep apnea who began PAP therapy between Jan. 1, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2014. Participants had a mean age of 56 years, and about 54 percent were men. General quality of life measures, such as mobility and usual activity, were assessed using the European Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Sleep-specific quality of life was examined with the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), which assesses the effect of sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness on activities of daily living such as productivity and intimacy.

The release does a good job describing the study itself, and how the authors broke down patients into subgroups that compared age and socio-economic status.
But the release also left much to be desired: it didn’t describe the limitations of retrospective studies or adequately discuss the harms or costs of these machines, which can be prohibitively expensive for some patients.

Not long after, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n""Fast forward now, and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening,"" Stecker says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography/Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography/Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography\n\nStecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called Wheelchair Kamikaze.\n\nMore than a year ago, Stecker started writing about a theory Italian physician Paolo Zamboni proposed in 2008 called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.\n\nIt\'s been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and death. However, Zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins — leading to inflammation, which, in turn, causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nZamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. Stecker was hopeful.\n\n""Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it,"" Stecker says.\n\nThe \'Liberation Procedure\'\n\nTo clear the veins, his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon. Zamboni calls it ""the liberation procedure"" but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it\'s used to open clogged arteries — not veins.\n\nA Brief History Of Multiple Sclerosis In 1822, Augustus D\'Este, the grandson of England\'s King George III, began documenting his illness, which would one day be identified as multiple sclerosis. Since D\'Este\'s day, researchers have learned how to better treat the disease, but have not yet found a cure. Here is a timeline of some key events along the way.\n\n1868: Scientists identify multiple sclerosis as a distinct condition. 1878: Myelin, which insulates nerve fibers, is discovered. In MS, the body erodes the myelin, which damages nerve fibers and interrupts brain signals. 1916: Using a microscope James Dawson examines the brains of people who died from MS. He is able to describe in depth the damage done by the disease. 1969: Researchers use a hormone typically made by the pituitary gland to treat the symptoms of MS. 1981: The MRI is first used to help diagnose MS, reducing diagnosis time from seven years to six months after the first symptom. 1993: Doctors begin using a drug called Beta interferon 1-b to reduce disease flare-ups. 2008: Paolo Zamboni proposes the theory Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency. — From the National Multiple Sclerosis Society\n\n""At first, I was very skeptical. But anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it.…So, I decided, you know, hey it was worth a shot,"" Stecker says.\n\nBut it didn\'t work. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says.\n\nStill, some would say Stecker was lucky. Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later. Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as ""stents,"" placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots. Several patients have even died as a result.\n\nStecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. But he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure.\n\n""CCSVI equals hope and a lot of MS patients just are completely devoid of hope,"" Stecker says. ""People don\'t want to have MS. They want to go back to who they used to be. You know, along comes this theory that offers an easy-to-understand solution, so it\'s very, very, very seductive.""\n\nGrowing Public Controversy\n\n\n\nIt\'s so seductive, in fact, that Canadians and Americans with MS have been flocking overseas to get the ""liberation procedure."" Something that many researchers find very troubling. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography\n\n""Even if the treatment is not useful for patients with MS, I don\'t think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in MS,"" Zivadinov says. ""And I think this merits very detailed understanding of what is going on.""\n\nWhat is going on is still a bit of a mystery. Critics argue that although Zamboni\'s original research suggests a vascular cause for MS, other studies don\'t. These discrepancies, and growing public controversy, prompted the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the U.S. and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada to take Zamboni\'s claims seriously. They funded a number of independent studies to investigate the relationship between CCSVI and MS.\n\nRobert Fox, a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic, currently oversees one of the studies funded by an MS Society grant. He says part of the confusion comes from variations in how CCSVI is measured.\n\n""That\'s absolutely one of the potential problems in the previous studies: Are the techs who got negative results, did they just not know how to do the ultrasound in the way that Dr. Zamboni described doing the ultrasound?

One that may have an impact beyond any single disease.\n\n""What professor Zamboni discovered in terms of veins is something much bigger than multiple sclerosis,"" Zivadinov says. ""We need to understand the role of the venous system in the pathology of central nervous diseases and aging.""\n\nZamboni himself says that even if it turns out he\'s wrong, coming to a greater understanding of the disease would be the big reward — both for him and thousands of MS patients.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">NPR does a good job of putting a human face on the disappointment when the search for a “cure” doesn’t pan out.

Once a person reaches puberty, the next five years are vitally important in this respect.""\n\nThe athletes in the study were all playing high-level sport - the footballers in Exeter City FC\'s youth setup, and the swimmers and cyclists at leading clubs in the South West.\n\nThe boys in the control group, though generally active, were not involved in regular sport.\n\nDespite the many health benefits of cycling and swimming, the study found little difference in bone development between cyclists, swimmers and the control group.\n\n""This raises a question about whether swimming and cycling are good for bone development,"" Dr Gracia Marco said.\n\n""We now need to consider how to counteract the lack of bone growth stimulus caused by cycling and swimming, possibly by encouraging swimmers and cyclists to add weight-bearing exercise in their training.""\n\nOne innovative aspect of the study was the measurement of bone texture of the lumbar spine using trabecular bone score (TBS) - the first use of this technique in adolescent athletes.\n\nThe paper, entitled: ""Longitudinal Adaptations of Bone Mass, Geometry and Metabolism in Adolescent Male Athletes. The PRO-BONE Study"", is published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.\n\nThe research is part of a larger University of Exeter study called PRO-BONE.\n\n###\n\nNote to editors: Being a UK university, when we say ""football"" we mean the game otherwise known as soccer.']","Summary of observational study on the bone-building benefits of participating in youth soccer omits potential harms, costs and study limitations.","The news release reports on a British study comparing bone development in 12- to 14-year-old boys who played football (or soccer, as it’s known in the United States) to those involved in competitive cycling or swimming and to active boys who did not regularly play sports.
The release touts the bone-building benefits of playing football but omits that the study on which it reports identified almost no significant difference in bone development measures between highly competitive soccer players and boys who were active but not involved in sports. It also left out any discussion of the risks or the financial costs associated with playing soccer competitively.

The researchers first exposed the tissue to native hormones such as oxytocin and chemical compounds to make it contract, mimicking normal or premature labor. They then exposed the tissue to bitter substances. By activating the bitter taste receptors in the uterus, the bitter substances relaxed the contracted uterine muscle tissue more completely than the current drugs used to prevent preterm labor in humans.

The release neglects to share the name of the “bitter substance” (chloroquine) used to halt contractions in the human and mouse tissue, nor does it say how the experimental substance compared with any of the current treatments or name any of them.
The release also would have served readers better by including a clear explanation that bitter taste receptors — usually only associated with the tongue — also exist in other cells in the body and that stopping early contractions is not always the best course of treatment.

But each shot costs as much as $1,000, and because the drug has a limited track record, experts do not agree on how well it works.\n\nProponents say Vivitrol could save money compared with the cost of locking up a drug offender — about $25,000 a year for each inmate at the Sheridan Correctional Center, 70 miles southwest of Chicago.\n\nNew drug offered to addicted inmates combats opioid epidemic\n\nDr. Joshua Lee, of New York University’s medical school, said more evidence is needed to determine whether the medication can help substantial numbers of people and whether it’s worth paying for, but the early results are encouraging.\n\n“It sounds good, and for some of us, it feels like the right thing to do,” said Lee, a leading researcher on the treatment.\n\nVivitrol is emerging as the nation searches for ways to ease an opioid epidemic that affects more than 2 million Americans and an estimated 15 percent of the U.S. prison population. Many experts view prisons — where addiction’s human toll can be seen most clearly — as a natural place to discover what works.\n\nChristopher Wolf had already served prison time for nonviolent crimes when he was ordered into treatment for a heroin addiction by a judge who suggested Vivitrol. Three months later, the 36-year-old from Centerville, Ohio, is clean and working full time as a cook.\n\nHe now suggests the medication to other addicts.\n\n“I don’t have cravings,” Wolf said. “I see how much better life is. It gets better really fast.”\n\nVivitrol targets receptors in the brain’s reward system, blocking the high and extinguishing urges. In some programs, prisoners get an injection before release, then follow-up shots from any clinic.\n\nFor decades, researchers have recognized addiction as a relapsing brain disease with medication an important part of therapy. But most jails and prisons reject methadone and buprenorphine, the other government-approved medications for opioid addiction, because they are habit-forming and can be abused.\n\nJust ask Joshua Meador, 28, an inmate at Sheridan who hopes to get into the Vivitrol program before his release in January. Before incarceration, he abused both older treatment drugs. When given take-home doses of methadone for the weekend, he would sell them for heroin.\n\n“When I’m on Vivitrol, I can’t get high,” he said. The drug has no street value or abuse potential.\n\n“You couldn’t design something better for the criminal justice system,” said David Farabee of the University of California at Los Angeles, who leads a Vivitrol study in a New Mexico jail. “There’s been pushback with other medications, people saying, ‘We’re just changing one drug for another.’ That argument goes out the window when you’re talking about a blocker” like Vivitrol.\n\nPrison systems in Illinois, Vermont, Wyoming and Wisconsin are trying the drug on a small scale. Michigan is offering Vivitrol to parolees who commit small crimes, if addiction is the reason for their new offense. The federal Bureau of Prisons ran a field trial in Texas and plans to expand the program to the Northeast next year. The drug’s manufacturer hopes prisons will be the gateway to a larger market.\n\nAlso known as extended-release naltrexone, the medication won Food and Drug Administration approval for alcohol dependence in 2006 and in 2010 to prevent relapse in post-detox opioid users.\n\nThe evidence for giving Vivitrol to inmates is thin but promising.\n\nIn the biggest study, sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 300 offenders — most of them heroin users on probation or parole — were randomly assigned to receive either Vivitrol or brief counseling and referral to a treatment program.\n\nAfter six months, the Vivitrol group had a lower rate of relapse, 43 percent compared with 64 percent. A year after treatment stopped, there had been no overdoses in the Vivitrol group and seven overdoses, including three deaths, in the other group. The results, published in March in the New England Journal of Medicine, have been promoted by the drugmaker, Ireland-based Alkermes, as it markets Vivitrol to U.S. correctional systems.\n\nYet addiction is stubborn. When the injections stopped, many in the study relapsed. A year later, relapse rates looked the same in the two groups.\n\n“It does suggest six months wasn’t enough,” said Lee, the lead author.\n\nT.J. Voller was a Vivitrol success story — until he wasn’t. After Vivitrol was approved by the FDA, Voller talked about getting the shot with The Associated Press and Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN segment. The 30-year-old was back at work and seemed proud of his recovery. But after 10 months on Vivitrol, he died of a heroin overdose.\n\n“He was alone for the weekend and picked up that needle one last time,” said his mother, Kathi Voller of Raynham, Massachusetts.\n\nAdvocates argue that inmates have a constitutional right to all FDA-approved addiction medications throughout their incarceration.\n\n“Treatment should be offered from the moment they are brought into the system,” said Sally Friedman, legal director of the New York-based Legal Action Center, which is looking for a test case to bring to court.\n\nPhysicians have learned to be cautious about pharmaceutical company marketing, said Andrew Kolodny, senior scientist at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University.\n\nNot so for criminal justice officials, who may be too trusting, Kolodny said.\n\n“When the drug company sends someone in to give them a talk and buy them pizza, they think they’re getting a scientific lecture,” he said.\n\nAlkermes spokeswoman Jennifer Snyder said the company’s sales team helps educate corrections staff and community care providers only after they have shown interest in Vivitrol.\n\nThere’s widespread agreement that counseling, support groups and treatment for underlying problems such as depression are crucial for Vivitrol patients, said Dr. Joseph Garbely of Pennsylvania-based Caron Treatment Centers, which supports medication-assisted treatment and prefers Vivitrol.\n\n“The disease of addiction is a cunning, baffling and powerful one,” Garbely said. “And you need all hands on deck.”']",This story’s focus on cautionary aspects of the drug’s use and marketing does a nice job of illuminating the complexity of drug introductions.,"
Extended-release naltrexone, which blocks the effects of opioid use, is being increasingly used by prisons in an effort to help prisoners with opioid use disorder stay off drugs once they have been released.
This story tracks that experimental use of the drug, marketed as Vivitrol by the Ireland-based pharmaceutical company Alkermes, and reflects the hope on the part of both prison officials and inmates that the drug will prove effective. However, the story also emphasizes that research on the drug’s effectiveness among prisoners has been scant, the cost of injections is high, and the company appears to be actively marketing the drug to prisons where, according to one source, an insufficient level of wariness about marketing tactics may enhance gullibility. One could argue that the preliminary nature of these efforts to test Vivitrol in a prison environment should lead journalists to delay stories until more evidence is in hand. But this story’s focus on cautionary aspects of the drug’s use and marketing does a nice job of illuminating the complexity of drug introductions.

It also appeared to prevent colds in people who used it over the course of about five months.\n\n“This is great news,” says Kay Dickersin, PhD, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and director of the U.S. Cochrane Center. “We really don’t have interventions for colds that work.”\n\nThe review of 15 studies with 1,360 participants was published by the Cochrane group, an international collaboration of researchers that reviews evidence behind therapeutic interventions.

We think it did a nice job explaining the science behind zinc’s effect on colds, and it provided some good details about the possible harms associated with taking zinc.
But Reuters took a much more cautious approach – and appropriately so – with a headline that “Zinc will help your cold, at least a little”.  And the opening sentences:  “may take the edge off the common cold. But not a whole lot.”

SHP465 (triple-bead mixed amphetamine salts - MAS) is an investigational oral stimulant medication being evaluated in the U.S. as a potential treatment for ADHD, a therapeutic area with significant need for additional treatment options.\n\nThe primary efficacy analysis of study 305 demonstrated that SHP465, administered as a daily morning dose, was superior to placebo on the change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV (ADHD rating scale) total score, with a Least Squares (LS) mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -9.9 (95% CI: -13.0 to -6.8, p<0.001), suggesting a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms. SHP465 was also superior to placebo in the key secondary efficacy analysis on the clinical global impression improvement scale (CGI-I), with an LS mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -0.8 (95% CI: -1.1 to -0.5, p<0.001), indicating a significantly higher proportion of patients were rated improved on the CGI-I rating scale. The CGI-I is a standardized assessment tool that allows clinicians to rate the severity of ADHD illness, change over time and efficacy of medication.\n\nTreatment-emergent adverse events ≥ 5% for SHP 465-305 were decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, irritability, nausea, weight decrease and dizziness. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and similar to those observed in previous SHP465 studies and with other amphetamine compounds.\n\nThe completion of SHP465-305 addresses an FDA requirement to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHP465 in children and adolescents prior to filing a Class 2 resubmission of the medicine for FDA approval.\n\n""We are pleased with the positive results of the SHP465-305 study,"" said Philip J. Vickers, Ph.D., Head of Research & Development, Shire. ""These results represent an important step toward a new treatment option for patients with ADHD. Shire looks forward to including these data as part of the FDA resubmission and is eager to continue advancing this clinical program.""\n\nDr. Matthew Brams, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor at Baylor College of Medicine and principal investigator for study 305, added: ""The study of SHP465 in children and adolescents is an essential next step to progressing the clinical program. I\'m excited about these positive data from SHP465-305 because of the benefit that this potential new treatment option may provide for patients with ADHD.""\n\nOverall Robust SHP465 Clinical Development Program to Support Class 2 Resubmission\n\nIncluding study 305 and previous studies, Shire now has a robust database of 15 clinical studies evaluating SHP465 in more than 1,100 subjects. Once the pharmacokinetic study and an additional safety and efficacy Phase 3 trial in adults currently under way are complete later this year, Shire plans to add these study results to its existing SHP465 data set to submit a Class 2 resubmission for FDA approval of the medicine for treatment of ADHD. SHP465 remains on track for potential U.S. launch in the second half of 2017.\n\nIn previous adolescent and adult clinical studies, SHP465 demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo at 16 hours post dosing, with onset of action starting 4 hours post dosing, as measured by the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP). PERMP was not measured in the SHP465-305 study.\n\nProtection for Shire\'s ADHD Franchise Extends to 2029\n\nThere are patents supporting Shire\'s overall ADHD franchise in the U.S. that extend to 2029. With a launch planned for the second half of 2017, Shire expects that SHP465, following potential FDA approval, will have three years of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity and at least three patents listed in the FDA Orange Book expiring as late as May 2029.\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nShire enables people with life-altering conditions to lead better lives.\n\nOur strategy is to focus on developing and marketing innovative specialty medicines to meet significant unmet patient needs.\n\nWe focus on providing treatments in Rare Diseases, Neuroscience, Gastrointestinal and Internal Medicine and we are developing treatments for symptomatic conditions treated by specialist physicians in other targeted therapeutic areas, such as Ophthalmics.\n\nhttp://www.shire.com\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nStatements included herein that are not historical facts, including without limitation statements concerning our announced business combination with Baxalta and the timing and financial and strategic benefits thereof, our 20x20 ambition that targets $20 billion in combined product sales by 2020, as well as other targets for future financial results, capital structure, performance and sustainability of the combined company, the combined company\'s future strategy, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the anticipated timing of clinical trials and approvals for, and the commercial potential of, inline or pipeline products are forward-looking statements.

Shire’s release aimed at investors and financial reporters is the latest example.,"This news release announces the results of a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of a long-acting stimulant drug for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. The pharmaceutical company Shire completed this follow-up trial on the drug’s safety and efficacy after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required more data when Shire first sought approval for the drug.
The drug was tested in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years old with ADHD. The company claims that the drug showed significant improvement in both children and adolescents when compared with a placebo and on the clinical global impression improvement scale, a standardized measurement of improvement.
While the release is clearly targeted to investors and financial reporters, it was distributed and made available to a wide public audience. Just because a release is written for a business audience does not mean it should skimp on transparency. Its biggest weakness is the strong claims it makes without providing any links or references to published research where the results can be evaluated. We perused the company’s website for details of the study but came up empty-handed.

While the drug is not being hailed as a cure for peanut allergy, it has proven successful in building up patients’ tolerance to peanuts over time, lessening the potential for life-threatening complications.\n\n“We’re excited about the potential to help children and adolescents with peanut allergy protect themselves against accidentally eating a food with peanut in it,” said allergist Stephen Tilles, MD, ACAAI former president, study co-author and consulting advisor for Aimmune Therapeutics, according to EurekAlert. “Our hope when we started the study was that by treating patients with the equivalent of one peanut per day, many would tolerate as much as two peanuts. We were pleased to find that two thirds of people in the study were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts per day after nine to 12 months of treatment, and half the patients tolerated the equivalent of four peanuts.”\n\nFDA WARNS AGAINST HONEY PACIFIERS AFTER TEXAS INFANTS HOSPITALIZED WITH 'RARE' ILLNESS\n\nThe results, which were presented Sunday at the College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were based on study participants ranging in age from 4 to 55 years old. All participants, who mostly fell between ages 4 and 17, had a peanut allergy, but one third received a placebo while the rest were given a peanut protein powder that increased in dose over time.\n\nParticipants ingested the peanut protein under the supervision of a board-certified allergist as part of a process called an oral food challenge (OFC).\n\n“Reactions from the oral challenges at the end of the study were much milder than prior to treatment,” Tilles said, according to EurekAlert. “On average, the participants were able to tolerate a 100-fold higher dose of peanut at the end of the study than they did at the beginning. In addition, the symptoms caused by the 100-fold higher dose at the end of the study were milder than the symptoms on the lower dose at the beginning of the study.”\n\nEXPERTS: CHILDREN AT RISK OF LEAD POISONING IN CHATTANOOGA\n\nWith FDA approval this drug would mark the first treatment available by prescription for peanut allergies. The study’s authors noted that patients would need to stay on the drug in order to receive protection against the allergy.\n\n“This is not a quick fix, and it doesn’t mean people with peanut allergy will be able to eat peanuts whenever they want,” Jay Lieberman, MD, vice chair of the ACAAI Food Allergy Committee and study co-author, said, according to EurekAlert. “But it is definitely a breakthrough. The hope would be to have a treatment available in the second half of 2019. If that happens, people who receive and are able to tolerate this treatment should be protected from accidental exposures.""]",Harms and costs aren’t addressed.,"This Fox News story describes a new treatment for kids with peanut allergy called AR101, which could help protect against severe reactions to peanut ingestion. It’s one of two stories we reviewed about this important and newsworthy study. The other was from CNN.

It affects cells that play important roles in helping the immune system battle bacteria, viruses and fungi that can cause infections. Even the common cold can be deadly.\n\nSymptoms of the disease are frequently first noticed very early in life, as was the case with Evangelina.

In both studies, the ring lowered HIV cases by about 30%, though its effectiveness appears to be much better for women who used the ring consistently.\n\nThe ring contains an antiretroviral medication called dapivirine, which prevents HIV from making copies of itself. In the ring, the drug is used as “pre-exposure prophylaxis,” or PrEP, slowly leaching out in the vagina and preventing the virus from taking hold in nearby cells.\n\nOne of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries — Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe — over nearly two years. At the end of the study, the group of volunteers who had used the dapivirine ring had 27% fewer HIV infections than a control group who had a placebo ring with no drug, the study found.\n\nLooking by age, the researchers saw that the ring did not seem to help women younger than 21. But among women over the age of 21 who used it, new HIV cases went down by 61%.\n\nThe other study, which has not yet been published but was presented on Monday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections meeting in Boston, studied 2,000 women in South Africa and Uganda. Like the other study, in this one the ring had no visible effect in women younger than 21, whereas new HIV cases dropped by 37% in women over 21.\n\nThese age differences are probably due in part to how the women used the drug, the researchers say. Much like the contraceptive NuvaRing, the dapivirine ring should be kept in every day and replaced once a month for maximum effectiveness.\n\n“If used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? We don’t know that yet,” Jared Baeten, professor of global health, medicine, and epidemiology at the University of Washington and lead author on the study, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nAdherence is also a big issue for the only other PrEP on the market, a once-a-day pill called Truvada. Initial trials for the pill showed it led to a 44% decrease in HIV infection rates overall. But it’s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. Because of its high effectiveness, the CDC has since recommended that 1 in 4 gay and bisexual men should be prescribed the drug to prevent the spread of HIV.\n\nThe ring adds a new HIV prevention tool, which some experts say will be particularly useful in African countries where women are at highest risk for HIV infection. More than half of the 35 million people living with HIV worldwide are women, and the vast majority live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n“A prevention tool like a ring could be used discreetly, a woman would have control over it, and it could allow her to keep herself safe from HIV without having to ask a male partner to take on prevention strategies,” Baeten said. “That individual control of prevention is so powerful.”\n\nThe dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman’s sole source of protection.\n\n“There is absolute reason to celebrate. But 27% is a lower number than any of us would like to see,” Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global HIV-prevention advocacy group, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n“We obviously always want higher numbers. But 1 in 3 infections were prevented overall — and that’s huge.”\n\nWarren noted that other rings with antiretrovirals are also being developed, as well as rings that could offer multipurpose protection, against not only HIV but pregnancy.\n\nLike birth control, the more types of HIV prevention, the better, experts say.\n\n“For some women, a pill every day might work really well. For others, that may be not achievable,” Baeten said. “Pills and rings should be sitting next to each other as options.”']",An informative story on the benefits of the vaginal ring to prevent HIV in Africa would have been improved with outside experts.,"Vaginal ring. Credit: International Partnership for Microbicides
This article discusses two studies surrounding a new device for preventing HIV infection. The device is a vaginal ring that dispenses an antiviral compound called dapivirine which can prevent the spread of HIV in women, according to scientists presenting their research at a medical conference. The device must be worn daily and replaced monthly in order to be effective. One of the studies described was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the other was an unpublished abstract. The ring contains an antiviral agent that works against the virus, but experts caution this method only seems to curb about 27 percent of transmissions from one sexual partner to the other. This story does a good job of providing context, although we would have liked a more cautious headline (and less use of the word “huge,” in general, in the text) and a better definition of pre-exposure prophylaxis since previous efforts have mainly focused on treating those who already contracted the virus. We applaud the careful way the story gave details of the two research studies, including their size and length and where they were conducted. Because sub-Saharan Africa is hardest hit by HIV, and has few health resources, we wish the story had included discussion of how much the ring will cost.

Most are given radiation, but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent.\n\nThe study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute, showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment, 76.3 percent were still alive after 12 years, compared to 71.3 percent who had radiation alone.']",This was a complex study and the story did a good job in presenting it to readers.,"The New York Times covers a study of a treatment for prostate cancer that comes back after prostate removal surgery. The treatment is hormone blocking, or androgen deprivation therapy.

The Times does a nice job in capturing a complete portrait of prostate cancer, the problem with recurrence, and the difficulty in understanding why hormone blockers weren’t obviously beneficial — at least according to prior research. But what we appreciated the most was how it described the benefits of giving men hormone blockers in absolute terms; this is a more honest presentation of data, and doesn’t hype study results (unlike relative comparisons, in which a cure rate of say, 2%, is “double” a cure rate of 1%).

The cancer cells it finds would be analyzed and their genetic makeup determined, which would be useful in monitoring patients and targeting therapies to the individual.\n\nVeridex, a Johnson and Johnson company, announced the partnership in a statement, saying it involves Ortho Biotech Oncology Research and Development, a unit of Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development.\n\n""This new technology has the potential to facilitate an easy-to-administer, noninvasive blood test that would allow us to count tumor cells, and to characterize the biology of the cells,"" said Robert McCormack, Veridex\'s head of technology innovation and strategy.

It describes circulating tumor cells as cancer cells that have detached from a tumor and are found at very low levels in the bloodstream. Capturing and counting those cells can provide information to patients and doctors about prognoses with certain types of metastatic cancers, the statement said.\n\n""The value of capturing and counting CTCs is evolving as more research data is gathered about the utility of these markers in monitoring disease progression and potentially guiding personalized cancer therapy,"" the Veridex statement said.\n\nToner said you are likely to find just one circulating tumor cell in 5 to 10 billion blood cells. In fact, a tube of blood taken during an annual exam would only have a few CTCs.\n\n""The challenging goal of sorting extremely rare circulating tumor cells from blood requires continuous technological, biological and clinical innovation to fully explore the utility of these precious cells in clinical oncology,"" Toner said. ""We have developed and continue to develop a broad range of technologies that are evolving what we know about cancer and cancer care.""\n\nThe American Cancer Society said the new research is exciting, but it\'s important to remember it\'s just another step in the scientific process.

There is no cure for this disease and existing treatments just help alleviate some of the symptoms.\n\n“This is a big deal,” says Robert Beall, the president and CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. “The fact is it is obviously going to make a very big difference in the lives of patients.”\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes problems with the balance of salt going in and out of cells. A sticky mucus clogs organs, particularly the lungs and liver. It can also cause digestive problems. About 1,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the average person with the disease dies before age 40.\n\nIvacaftor works for people with the G551D mutation of cystic fibrosis. Konstan says that only about 4% of the people with the disease have this specific mutation. “It really is a major milestone in the treatment of cystic fibrosis,” he says. “Even thought it only affects a small percentage (of patients) the hope is there that we can finally do something about this disease.”\n\nThe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday, looked at 84 people who got the drug. Those taking ivacaftor saw improvements within two weeks, which continued for the nearly yearlong trial. Drug recipients could blow out more than 10% more air from their lungs compared with patients who were not taking the drug, and were about half as likely to have a “pulmonary exacerbation” or a worsening of their lung disease that often requires hospitalization. On average, patients taking the drug grew more and put on more weight than the placebo group, according to the study, and had lower sweat chloride – an indicator of the disease.\n\nBeall says the improved lung function helped patients double their ability to walk and one patient even started going the gym for the first time.\n\n“We have an incredible proof of concept,” Beall says. He points to other research under way with ivacaftor combined with another drug that could help people with the most common mutation of cystic fibrosis. That trial is ongoing and the treatment is at least four or five years away from approval, but if it works, Beall says, it could help 90% of the people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Pamela Davis, of Case Western University paraphrased Winston Churchill, “This study is also a great victory in the war against genetic diseases and marks the end of the beginning for the treatment of the cystic fibrosis defect.”\n\nIvacaftor has been submitted to the FDA for approval, and could be available next year, according to Konstan. When it goes on sale it will be sold under the brand name Kalydeco (pronounced kuh-LYE-deh-koh).']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The reporting of the basic facts is OK, but our criteria call for much more, and this story didn’t measure up on several. </span>","


More than 20 years after researchers identified the genetic mutation responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF), a treatment aimed at the cause of the disease, rather than its effects, has shown it can improve lung function and some other measures in patients with a rare form of the disease. While this story accurately reports key drug trial results and provides some context, it falls short in important ways by failing to note that there is not yet evidence the drug is safe for life-long use or can extend lives; and that it is unlikely to cure CF by itself. The story doesn’t tell readers that drug is likely to come with an extremely high price tag. It fails to note that the CF Foundation, whose CEO is prominently quoted touting the drug, has funded the drug’s development and may stand to profit from its sales.

The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. ""We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,"" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.\n\nThe discovery was ""distressing,"" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in ""severe stomach cramps and vomiting,"" she said. ""Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.""\n\nGlover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was ""a gift,"" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help ""lots of other children.""\n\nThe risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.\n\nEllis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. ""It\'s been a huge success,"" her mother said.\n\nThe study results, published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology\'s Annual Scientific Meeting, prove that the treatment can protect some children against accidental exposure to or ingestion of a very small amount of peanuts or peanut products.\n\nNot a cure\n\nDr. Brian Vickery, the study\'s lead author, director of the Children\'s Healthcare of Atlanta Food Allergy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine, cautioned that ""it\'s not a cure.""\n\n""It does not make the allergy to go away,"" Vickery said. ""The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.""\n\nStill, that\'s no small accomplishment, he said. There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular, which, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more.\n\n""I\'m telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,"" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment\'s effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nHow the study worked\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 551 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 499 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\nThe treatment , which comes in powder-filled capsules, is an oral immunotherapy, and the concept is ""treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they\'re allergic to,"" Vickery said. Essentially, the treatment is a peanut powder.\n\nEllis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children\'s Hospital in Little Rock, which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones, a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children\'s Hospital.\n\nEllis and Monica Glover in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children\'s Hospital in Little Rock.\n\n""We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,"" Glover said. ""You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. ""\n\nThree-quarters of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an ""exit food challenge"": They ate, under a doctor\'s supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. ""It\'s intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,"" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance.

Up to 7 percent of deaths have been attributed to sitting alone.\n\n“Sitting is bad for our health, but it is a big part of daily life for many people,” said Horswill, an expert in exercise and metabolism in UIC’s College of Applied Health Sciences. “Exercise is a good way to counteract the negative effects of sitting, but just incorporating physical activity into one part of our day may not be enough to overcome the damage caused by prolonged sitting and an otherwise sedentary lifestyle.”\n\nBecause the workday is a major contributor to sedentary behavior, with more than 20 percent of workers in the U.S. reporting more than 8 hours each day, tactics that promote workstation activity have emerged in recent years, including standing desks, as well as dynamic pedal and treadmill workstations.\n\nHorswill and his colleagues compared the metabolic rate produced by three workstations: seated at a desk, seated at a desk equipped with a device that stimulates leg movement and standing at a desk. The device, which is commercially available, was a movable footrest, suspended from the underside of the desk, which enabled the feet to swing, twist or teeter.\n\nParticipants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit. On a second visit, researchers collected metabolic rate and heart rate data during three progressive stages: seated, seated with the device and standing. Each stage was 15 minutes.\n\nThe researchers found that modest movement while seated elevated the metabolic rate more than sitting and more than standing, by 17 and 7 percent respectively, and had no detrimental effect on cognitive function. The findings are published in WORK, a journal affiliated with the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists and endorsed by the International Ergonomics Association.\n\n“These results suggest that non-exercise active thermogenesis, which we call NEAT, can increase movement and calorie burning, and may have the potential to impact health,” said Horswill, the senior author on the study. “We expected to see the metabolic rate increase with each progressive stage, but instead found that metabolic rates from movement while seated were either equal to or higher than rates while standing.”\n\nHorswill says the study needs to be further validated, but that the findings should be especially applicable to individuals poised to benefit from NEAT but unable to access popular standing desks because of injury, disability or discomfort.\n\n“This is more evidence that NEAT, something everyone can do throughout the day, may be an important strategy for improving health, and even reducing early death,” said Horswill.\n\nHaley Scott and Danel Voorhees are co-authors on the paper. Active Ideas LLC, which offers the HOVR device used in study, funded the research.']",This news release omitted the cost of the device and didn’t explain the limitations of such a small study.,"Getty Images
This news release from the University of Illinois discusses new research from their faculty, which finds that moving your legs while seated at your desk may boost your metabolic rate more than working at a standing desk. Published in the journal Work, these results are surprising and intriguing, yet flaws in the study mean that the release may have been premature. Some red flags include the fact that measurements were only taken once from a very small sample size, and that funding for the research came from the parent company of a device that was found to be so effective. The device (described as “a movable footrest, suspended from the underside of the desk, which enabled the feet to swing, twist or teeter”) was compared with sitting still at a desk and standing at a desk. The release also gives the reader no frame of reference for interpreting the study results, leaving us with more questions than answers.

2027,story_reviews_01035,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/4173/,2011-08-02 04:00:00,Stool test good for catching colon cancer: study,"['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The inexpensive tests that look for hidden blood in a person’s stool are effective for colon cancer screening, a study out Tuesday confirms.\n\nThe findings, reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, give some extra weight to fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) as a valid option for early detection of colon cancer.\n\nExperts generally recommend that people at average risk of colon cancer start screening tests for the disease at age 50. And they can pick from a number of tests that have all been found to cut the risk of dying from colon cancer.\n\nAlong with stool tests — done once a year at home — the choices include two invasive procedures: colonoscopy done every 10 years and flexible sigmoidoscopy done every five years.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally supported expert panel, recommends that people at average risk of colon cancer choose any of the three methods.\n\nFOBT detects hidden blood in the stool, which can be a sign of colon cancer or pre-cancerous growths called polyps. Positive results on the screen prompt a follow-up colonoscopy to investigate the source of the blood.\n\nAdvances in the stool tests in recent years have made them more effective. A newer version called immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT) is supposed to zero in on colon growths better than an older version known as guaiac FOBT — which often picked up bleeding originating in the upper digestive tract, such as from a stomach ulcer.\n\nImmunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test. But there’s been surprisingly little evidence that it really is highly “specific” to colon cancer, according to Dr. Yi-Chia Lee of National Taiwan University Hospital, one of the researchers on the new study.\n\nSo for their study, the researchers followed nearly 2,800 adults who all volunteered to have iFOBT, a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy to check for problems in the upper digestive tract.\n\nThey found that of 28 people confirmed to have colon tumors after a colonoscopy, all but one had also a positive iFOBT result.\n\n“It means that almost every case with colon cancer can be identified by iFOBT,” Lee told Reuters Health in an email. “It is a strong support to iFOBT as an effective screening tool.”\n\nThe researchers also found that iFOBT had “specificity” for colon cancer of close to 90 percent, meaning the test would accurately give a negative result to almost 90 percent of people who did not have colon cancer.\n\nOf three study participants who were found to have cancers of the stomach or esophagus, for instance, none had a positive result on the iFOBT test.\n\nLike any screening test, iFOBT does have a risk of false-positive results, which leads to unnecessary invasive testing in some people. In this study, about 10 percent of all participants had a false-positive finding on the stool test.\n\nAmong the risk factors for false-positives the authors identified were the use of anticlotting drugs and low levels of the iron-rich molecule hemoglobin in the blood.\n\nIn practice, a positive iFOBT result would be followed by colonoscopy, in which a scope is used to investigate the interior of the colon.\n\nWhether used for first-line screening or as a follow-up, colonoscopy has the advantage of allowing doctors to spot and remove pre-cancerous growths called polyps — which means the test can prevent cases of colon cancer.\n\nBut as far as cutting the risk of death from colon cancer, stool testing is similarly effective, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nAnd it’s much cheaper: iFOBT is more expensive than the older stool tests, but it is still roughly $30. A screening colonoscopy averages around $3,000.\n\nThe downside of iFOBT being specific to colon tumors is that it is not useful for catching cancers of the stomach or throat.\n\nThat’s particularly important in Asia, where those cancers are common.\n\nLee said researchers there are looking into whether combining iFOBT with the older guaiac test is useful for catching cancers in the lower and upper digestive tract — and whether adding a third stool test, which looks for the ulcer-causing bacteria H. pylori, can help as well. Infection with H. pylori is associated with increased risks of stomach and throat cancers.\n\nIn the U.S., cancers of the upper digestive tract are relatively uncommon. The average American has a one in 200 chance of developing esophageal cancer, while the risk of stomach cancer is one in 114.\n\nIn contrast, Americans’ lifetime risk of colon cancer is about one in 19, according to the American Cancer Society. More than 50,000 Americans died of the disease in 2010.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/mUOj1 Canadian Medical Association Journal, online August 2, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This is an important story – and well executed – about an approach to colon cancer screening that arguably doesn’t get enough public attention. </span>","Maybe somebody is paying attention to our criteria checklist.

These high and low phases are often so extreme they interfere with everyday life and work.\n\nIn a telephone interview Churchill said that in tests, his team found that mice who were made manic with small doses of amphetamines were able to be calmed again with ebselen.\n\n“In mice, ebselen works like lithium,” Churchill said. “Now we urgently need to see if it works like lithium in people.”\n\nSome 60 years after it was first discovered, lithium - a mood stabiliser that can protect against both depression and mania, and reduce the risk of suicide - remains the most effective long-term treatment.\n\nBut it is very toxic - at only twice the right dose it could kill a patient, Churchill said - and its adverse side-effects mean many people stop taking the drug and relapse into episodes of mania and depression.\n\nChurchill worked with Sridhar Vasudevan to filter through a library of existing drugs - the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection - that are considered safe but do not currently have a proven use.\n\nThey screened the library for any drugs that blocked an enzyme that is key to lithium’s success and found ebselen was a possible lithium mimic.\n\n“This is one of the first handful of examples of drug repurposing, where a new use has been found for an existing drug,” Vasudevan said.\n\nEbselen is an antioxidant originally developed up to late stage, or phase III, clinical trials by the Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo for the treatment of stroke, but which never reached market and is now out of patent.\n\nVasudevan said his study, reported in the journal Nature Communications, showed ebselen had the same or similar action as lithium in the brains of mice, blocking the same enzyme.\n\nThe researchers are a now starting a small study in healthy human volunteers to look for effects on brain function. If that shows ebselen has similar effects to lithium, they plan to move to second stage trial in bipolar patients. (Editing by Pravin Char)']","It would have been helpful if the story had pursued the question about out how long it typically takes a lab discovery of this nature to go to market as an available treatment (if it proves effective in humans). Instead, a mouse study that was inadequately explained was headlined as if the “drug may help people.”","We wish that the story had quantified some of the benefits and side effects and that it had brought in some outside perspectives, which might have toned down the comment about “at only twice the right dose (lithium) could kill a patient.”  Also, adverse effects aren’t the only reason patients stop lithium.  Many stop because they enjoy the mania and don’t like the so-called “neutral” mood (absence of a depressive or manic cycle).

However, some researchers said, there are some complicating factors, both in the trial data and in other studies, that would favor Lucentis.\n\n“The data is going to be interpreted many different ways,’’ said one investigator in the trial, who spoke under condition of anonymity but would not provide any trial results. Revealing trial results before they are published or presented at a conference is considered a violation of scientific protocol.\n\nGenentech developed Lucentis to treat the wet form of age-related macular degeneration, the most common cause of severe vision loss in the elderly. While Avastin, which is a cancer drug, has not been approved for use in treating macular degeneration, it has the same mechanism of action as Lucentis. And Avastin costs only about $50 per injection into the eye, compared to roughly $2,000 for Lucentis.\n\nMany eye doctors already are using Avastin off-label to treat macular degeneration, and many say it appears to work just as well as Lucentis. But there has never been a definitive trial to compare the two drugs.\n\nSo the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, sponsored a randomized trial involving 1,200 patients. Results are scheduled to be presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The results will also be published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nSome 1.6 million Americans have advanced forms of age-related macular degeneration and the number is expected to increase as baby boomers age. In 2008, Medicare paid for 480,000 injections of Avastin to treat macular degeneration and 337,000 injections of Lucentis, according to a study led by Dr. Philip Rosenfeld of the University of Miami. Yet Medicare paid only $20 million for the Avastin compared to $537 million for the smaller number of Lucentis injections.\n\nInvestigators in the National Eye Institute trial had a day-long meeting on Tuesday in Chicago to learn the results. But they were sworn to secrecy.\n\nBut two people familiar with the data, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that injections of Lucentis and Avastin every four weeks resulted in vision changes after one year that were essentially the same.\n\nThe result was largely expected. Under the rules of the trial, patients treated with Avastin could read on average of up to five fewer letters on an eye chart than those treated with Lucentis and Avastin would still be considered “non-inferior.” It is believed the results were closer than five letters, however.\n\nStill, doctors will be looking closely at details of the data. One person said Avastin was less effective than Lucentis in decreasing the thickness of the retina, suggesting that Avastin might not prove as effective in preserving vision over a period beyond one year. Patients in the trial are being followed for a second year.\n\nSafety of the two drugs will also be closely watched. However, experts say that with only 1,200 patients, the trial will be able to detect only major differences in safety.\n\nAnother part of the trial compared injecting the drugs as needed, depending on the course of the patient’s disease, rather than on a strict monthly schedule. One source said Avastin was slightly inferior to Lucentis, but the other said the results of the two drugs were the same.\n\nThe trial comparing the two drugs is of the type known as a comparative effectiveness study. Such studies are being encouraged under the new health reform law, though this one started before the law was enacted.\n\nGenentech, which is owned by Roche, has already mounted a pre-emptive counterattack aimed at nullifying any results of the federal trial that would shift more patients to Avastin.\n\nThe company sponsored a study looking at records of nearly 78,000 Medicare recipients with age-related macular degeneration. The study found that those who received Avastin had an 11 percent higher risk of dying and a 57 percent higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke than those getting Lucentis, according to an abstract of the study posted on the Web site of the upcoming ophthalmology conference, where the results will be presented.\n\nGenentech arranged for the lead investigator of this study, Dr. Emily W. Gower of Johns Hopkins University, to brief Congressional staffers on the results on Tuesday.\n\nIf this finding is considered valid, it could render the results of the National Eye Institute trial somewhat moot by raising safety questions about Avastin.\n\n“Once you plant that seed of doubt in patients’ minds it’s very difficult to overcome that,’’ said one retina specialist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “I would say it changes the landscape.’’\n\nHowever, experts have not been able to scrutinize the data of this study. One obvious potential flaw is that people who get the cheaper Avastin are more likely to be poor and uninsured and might therefore have worse health to begin with than those who get Lucentis. The study tried to correct for this but whether it did so adequately is a subject of debate.\n\nRoche sells Lucentis in the United States and Novartis in other countries. Sales of the drug for each company were about $1.5 billion last year.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Don’t just read the star score for this story.  The real story here is one of “inside baseball” – and how journals, embargoes, industry interests and the drive to get scoops in journalism often rule the day.  So read the full review and how some other journalists reacted. </span>","This NYT blog piece broke the story of a trial of one company’s $50 drug versus its $2,000 drug for the same problem – age-related macular degeneration.

The researchers believe the DTI technique may expand the options for older women, who are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction.\n\nGood Results with DTI Breast Reconstruction in Women over 65\n\nDirect-to-implant breast reconstruction has emerged as a single-stage approach to immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy. So far, however, most studies of DTI have focused on younger women.\n\n""Half of all breast cancers occur in women over 65, yet only four to 14 percent of these women undergo reconstruction,"" Dr. Moreira and coauthors write. Most studies of breast reconstruction in older women have focused on multiple-step techniques such as tissue expander implant (TEI) reconstruction.\n\nThe researchers identified women over age 65 who underwent DTI reconstruction at the Cleveland Clinic between 2012 and 2015. They identified a total of 24 breasts reconstructed by DTI in 19 patients, all with at least 30 days\' follow-up and most with one year of follow-up\n\nPatient characteristics and outcomes were compared to those of 109 breasts with TEI reconstruction in 98 patients. The women undergoing DTI reconstruction were older (73.5 versus 69.2 years) and had a higher body mass index, compared to the TEI group.\n\nBoth DTI and TEI were safe and effective options for breast reconstruction. Complication rates were similar between groups, including blood and fluid collections (hematoma and seroma), infection, unplanned surgery, and failed reconstruction.\n\nHowever, DTI had some important advantages. Women in the DTI group were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital and spent fewer total days in the hospital. In the year after surgery was completed, women in the DTI group made an average of 6.5 office visits, compared to about 12 visits in the TEI group.\n\nThe DTI group also spent fewer days with a surgical drain in place: average about 13 days, compared to 23 days in the and had fewer total days in the hospital. That\'s an important consideration, as drains require antibiotic treatment to prevent infection, in addition to causing discomfort for the patient.\n\nThe authors note some important limitations of their study--particularly the fact that it was a review study of one hospital\'s experience with a relatively new procedure. Dr. Moreira and colleagues write, ""These reported cases include our learning curve patients as we familiarized ourselves with appropriate patient selection and surgical technique.""\n\nThe researchers emphasize that DTI isn\'t an option for every patient, depending on breast shape and other factors. Despite these limitations, their experience suggests that complications of the DTI approach in older women are similar to those of the more commonly used TEI technique. Dr. Moreira adds, ""In appropriately selected cases, DTI reconstruction is a viable alternative to staged techniques requiring multiple surgeries.""\n\n###\n\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer.\n\nClick here to read ""Direct-to-Implant Breast Reconstruction in Women Older than 65 Years: A Retrospective Analysis of Complication Rate and Overall Outcomes.""\n\nDOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004015\n\nAbout Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\n\nFor more than 70 years, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® (http://www. prsjournal. com/ ) has been the one consistently excellent reference for every specialist who uses plastic surgery techniques or works in conjunction with a plastic surgeon.

In about half of patients with melanoma that has spread, tumor growth is caused by genetic mutations that keep the BRAF protein -- part of the MAPK cell growth pathway -- constantly activated. Drugs that inhibit BRAF activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about 90 percent of patients. But the response is temporary in most cases, and tumor growth resumes in six or seven months, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious research suggested that this drug resistance develops because the MAPK pathway gets turned back on through activation of MEK, another protein that is part off the MAPK pathway.\n\n""We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy,"" study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release.\n\nThe phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs.\n\n""We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. In fact, the combination was at least twice as effective as BRAF inhibition alone,"" he said.\n\nOne expert agreed that the results were encouraging.\n\n""This study addresses the problem of resistance to the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway. This study combined dabrafenib [a selective BRAF inhibitor] and trametinib, [a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor]. These drugs can be safely combined, and the survival was significantly improved without untoward side effects,"" said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nThe study was conducted at 14 sites in the United States and Australia and included 162 patients who received different dose combinations of the drugs: two daily 150 milligram (mg) doses of dabrafenib plus one 2 mg dose of trametinib; the same dabrafenib dose with a 1 mg dose of trametinib; or treatment with dabrafenib alone.\n\nPatients who received dabrafenib alone were able to receive the full-dose combination treatment if their cancer resumed progression.\n\nTreatment with both combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib led to a four-month longer delay in drug resistance than treatment with dabrafenib alone. After one year of treatment, 41 percent of patients receiving the full-dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma, compared with 9 percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone.\n\nAmong patients receiving the combination treatment, the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs.\n\nThe study was scheduled for presentation Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Vienna and simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Cancer Society has more about melanoma.']",“Postponing resistance” is not the same as “prolonging survival” — something this story based on a press release never tried to explain.,"This was an inadequate story about a combination of experimental drugs to treat melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. It relied inappropriately on a press release, downplayed the treatment’s harms, and didn’t explain how the study’s primary outcome, progression-free survival, differs from overall survival.

At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy\'s missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.\n\nWyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.\n\n""His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,"" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.\n\nSo when a friend shared a story from the ""Today Show"" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.\n\n""He doesn\'t need this,"" she thought.\n\nHer fifth-grader had a different reaction: ""I want one of these robot arms!"" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. ""I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!""\n\nThere were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn\'t really thought about but he clearly had.\n\nFalardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.\n\nThe UCF team, which operates a nonprofit called Limbitless Solutions , is special because it\'s the only group in the 3-D volunteer network making electronic arms. Most 3-D arms are mechanical, which presents a challenge for children without elbows. With mechanical arms, the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow. The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep.\n\n""It\'s really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?"" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. ""It\'s just one problem after another we keep solving. That\'s what engineering is all about.""\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren\'t available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.\n\nThe UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.\n\n""My mother taught us that we\'re supposed to help change the world,"" Manero said at the time. ""We\'re supposed to help make it better.""\n\nThe students were blown away by what happened after that. The ""Today Show"" and other national news outlets featured stories about Alex and Manero, and then they got international attention. Families in more than 25 countries have asked the UCF students to help their children. In February, Microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world.\n\nEach electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school\'s manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.\n\nPetresky got involved with the design of Pring\'s hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.\n\n""He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,"" he said. ""I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.""\n\nEventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.\n\nPetresky says they ask every family about the child\'s favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can ""not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.""\n\nAs they\'ve designed the bionics, they\'ve learned that kids don\'t necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney\'s ""Frozen,"" and in Wyatt\'s case, the blue-skinned men from ""Blue Man Group."" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex\'s plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from ""Transformers.""\n\n""We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,"" Petresky said. ""There\'s a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.""\n\nThe team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.\n\nHe expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.\n\nHis mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.\n\n""The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can\'t buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,"" she wrote in her iReport. ""Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children.""\n\nAs they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can\'t wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm. And someday, he said, he wants to go to UCF and help other kids like him.']",Our reviewers didn’t want to seem heartless toward a story that profiles volunteers doing wonderful work. But they couldn’t find much useful information for someone who might actually need the services described in this story.,"This story is a “gee whiz, look at what these brainy college kids are up to” celebration of the charitable work of young engineers. Perhaps it isn’t entirely fair to hold it to our criteria for medical news stories. However, it promotes the use a specific medical device without telling readers whether it is really the best option for the featured patient or others like him.

Bipolar disorder often is misdiagnosed as major depression. But while the symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder are similar to that of major depression, the treatments are different and often challenging for the physician. In bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, a patient swings between an emotional high (manic episode) and severe depression. Treatment for the depressed phase includes an antidepressant along with a safeguard such as a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic drug to prevent a switch to a manic episode. A physician who misdiagnoses bipolar disorder as major depression could inadvertently trigger a manic episode by prescribing an antidepressant without a safeguard mood stabilizing drug. The study found that heart rate variability, as measured by an electrocardiogram, indicated whether subjects had major depression or bipolar disorder. (Heart rate variability is a variation in the time interval between heartbeats.) The study, by senior author Angelos Halaris, MD, PhD and colleagues, was published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry. ""Having a noninvasive, easy-to-use and affordable test to differentiate between major depression and bipolar disorder would be a major breakthrough in both psychiatric and primary care practices,"" Dr. Halaris said. Dr. Halaris said further research is needed to confirm the study’s findings and determine their clinical significance. Dr. Halaris is a professor in Loyola\'s department of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences and medical director of adult psychiatry. Major depression is among the most common and severe health problems in the world. In the United States, at least 8 to 10 percent of the population suffers from major depression at any given time. While less common than major depression, bipolar disorder is a significant mental health problem, affecting an estimated 50 million people worldwide. The Loyola study enrolled 64 adults with major depression and 37 adults with bipolar disorder. All subjects underwent electrocardiograms at the start of the study. Each participant rested comfortably on an exam table while a three-lead electrocardiogram was attached to the chest. After the patient rested for 15 minutes, the electrocardiographic data were collected for 15 minutes. Using a special software package, researchers converted the electrocardiographic data into the components of heart rate variability. These data were further corrected with specialized software programs developed by study co-author Stephen W. Porges, PhD, of Indiana University\'s Kinsey Institute. In measuring heart rate variability, researchers computed what is known to cardiologists as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). At the baseline (beginning of the study), the subjects with major depression had significantly higher RSA than those with bipolar disorder. In a secondary finding, researchers found that patients with bipolar disorder had higher blood levels of inflammation biomarkers than patients with major depression. Inflammation occurs when the immune system revs up in response to a stressful condition such as bipolar disorder. The study is titled ""Low cardiac vagal tone index by heart rate variability differentiates bipolar from major depression."" In addition to Drs. Halaris and Porges, other co-authors are Brandon Hage, MD, a graduate of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine now at the University of Pittsburgh (first author); Stritch student Briana Britton; Loyola psychiatric resident David Daniels, MD; and Keri Heilman, PhD of the University of North Carolina.']","A “simple electrocardiogram” can help diagnose major depression or bipolar disorder, a Loyola Medicine news release claims, but where are the data to support this “groundbreaking” study?","A news release by Loyola Medicine covers what it called a “groundbreaking” study that measured heart rate variability to help differentiate between major depression and bipolar disorder. It adds this would be a “major breakthrough in psychiatric and primary care practices” — made possible by a “simple 15-minute electrocardiogram.”
We caution against the use of such language in a news release because medical research rarely uncovers earth-shattering, dramatic findings. This study is no different and is actually not the first of its kind. The news release also uses ambiguous terminology when revealing the study’s findings, such as the word “significant.”
Many details on the study design, including limitations and funding sources, are left out. There is no discussion of costs, and no data are given to back up the news release’s claims. It also would have been helpful to note how major depression and bipolar disorder are traditionally diagnosed.
The news release does a good job summarizing the profiles of both conditions, including the consequences of misdiagnosing bipolar disorder as major depression.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nScientists from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute and the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) said the protein, called microseminoprotein-beta or MSMB, is found at reduced levels in men diagnosed with the disease and are also lower in men with more aggressive forms of the cancer.\n\n“The protein is easy to detect because it is found in urine and would potentially be a very simple test to carry out on men to identify those most at risk of developing the disease,” said Hayley Whitaker of the Cambridge institute, who led the study.\n\nWhitaker said that while it could be around five years before the results of this study are translated into a test for doctors to use in clinics, she hoped it would then also help them to determine which patients have aggressive tumors.\n\nProstate cancer killed an estimated 258,000 men around the world in 2008 and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States. In Britain, around 35,000 men are diagnosed with it and some 10,000 die from the disease.\n\nThe most effective screening tests currently available are based on a single biomarker called prostate specific antigen (PSA). But PSA testing is problematic because it has low specificity, which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment.\n\nA U.S. study published last year found that routine PSA prostate screening has resulted in more than one million American men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.\n\n“At the moment, PSA testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations, so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as MSMB that could be used in screening and diagnosis,” said Rosalind Eeles of the ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital, who also worked on the study.\n\nThe protein — which regulates prostate cell death — is produced by normal prostate cells.\n\nThe scientists took tissue and urine samples from around 350 men both with and without prostate cancer to test MSMB levels.\n\nThe results, published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) ONE journal, showed that MSMB is found at significantly lower levels in the urine of men diagnosed with prostate cancer than those without the disease. They also showed men with aggressive tumors were also likely to have lower levels of the protein in their urine.\n\nCommenting on the study, Kate Holmes of the UK’s Prostate Cancer Charity, said they could prove very valuable in future.\n\n“Given the known limitations of the PSA blood test, finding a technique to accurately diagnose prostate cancer is the Holy Grail of research into the disease,” she said in a statement.\n\n“An accurate, reliable urine test for prostate cancer would be an invaluable tool if it is proven to be successful on a large scale.”""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story’s first sentence foresees a day with ""a quick and simple test"" for prostate cancer risk.  But in leaping to that future possibility, it jumped over a discussion of data – today – limited though that may have been.  Which is, of course, the story. </span>"," This is a story about a study for a test under development, the results of which suggest that it may be better able to predict which diagnosed prostate cancers are aggressive and which are not.  This would be an exciting development as indicated by the spokesperson from the UK Prostate Charity.  However – the story should have tempered its enthusiasm a bit until the results have been reproduced.

It\'s designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis. While not quite a cure, the drug is extremely effective for some CF patients.\n\nBut the success of Kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making.\n\nA good starting point for the story is Aug. 24, 1989. That\'s the day scientists from the U.S. and Canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease. It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize.\n\nCF is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. When people inherit a damaged form of the CF gene, a critical protein inside cells doesn\'t work properly. As a result, sticky mucus builds up in a patient\'s lungs, causing infections and making it hard to breathe.\n\nThe announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the Sept. 8 issue of Science, but a reporter for Reuters got hold of the story early. Science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication.\n\nAt the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach.\n\nThe first prediction turned out to be right. ""But it wasn\'t until 20 years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis,"" says Fred Van Goor, who led the team at what is now Vertex Pharmaceuticals that developed Kalydeco. ""So it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of Kalyedco.""\n\ntoggle caption Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nIt took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the CF gene makes. ""We tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis,"" says Van Goor.\n\nOne of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug, but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth, and so it would last the right length of time in a patient\'s body.\n\nFrom the start, Van Goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.\n\nBut for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well.\n\nEmily Schaller was in one of the early studies of Kalydeco. As part of the study, researchers first gave her a placebo, then switched her to the active drug. She knew within days that something was different.\n\n""I was with my brother in Florida, and we were walking down the street, and I took a deep breath, and when I took a deep breath in and I let it out, I didn\'t cough,"" says Schaller. ""But not only did I not cough, but I felt that my lungs were clear, and that something huge had happened. It was just something I had never felt in my life before.""\n\nSchaller isn\'t cured. She still has a damaged CF gene. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one. Although it seems simple in theory, in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish.\n\nSchaller isn\'t particularly bothered by that. ""Everyone talks about curing a disease — cure CF, cure these other diseases. [But] Kalydeco controls CF at the basic defect, so I\'m OK with the other \'c\' word, control, because I\'m living it and I\'ve never felt better in my life.""\n\nThe time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.\n\nThey\'re also likely to be expensive. Kalydeco costs in the neighborhood of $300,000 per year.']","The star score doesn’t reflect the strong points about this piece. The story was told with an engaging and interesting style, and provided historical reflections on the science and on past journalism on the topic.  Still, we wish it had provided more evidence and more outside perspective.","This is a story about the early promise of gene therapy failing to translate into an array of new clinical treatments. In a way, the story mirrors the problems with gene therapy that it describes. It promises to be a powerful antidote to all the hype surrounding gene therapy. It provides some targeted information relevant to a subset of patients, but it ultimately does not deliver a very well rounded picture of the drug it describes, skipping over specific details about benefits, harms, availability and true novelty. We give NPR a lot of credit for taking on the topic at all and admire the economy of storytelling for such a complicated topic. At the same time, the story may have covered more ground in the same amount of time by including some independent voices and providing a few hard numbers to back up claims that the drug was “remarkable” and “stunning.”

People who experience them see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations) and/or have false beliefs (delusions). The hallucinations and delusions experienced with Parkinson’s disease are serious symptoms, and can lead to thinking and emotions that are so impaired that the people experiencing them may not relate to loved ones well or take appropriate care of themselves.\n\n“Hallucinations and delusions can be profoundly disturbing and disabling,” said Mitchell Mathis, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Nuplazid represents an important treatment for people with Parkinson’s disease who experience these symptoms.”\n\nAn estimated 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease each year, according to the National Institutes of Health, and about one million Americans have the condition. The neurological disorder typically occurs in people over age 60, when cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine become impaired or die. Dopamine helps transmit signals between the areas of the brain that produce smooth, purposeful movement -- like eating, writing and shaving. Early symptoms of the disease are subtle and occur gradually. In some people Parkinson’s disease progresses more quickly than in others. As the disease progresses, the shaking, or tremor, which affects the majority of people with Parkinson’s disease, may begin to interfere with daily activities. Other symptoms may include depression and other emotional changes; hallucinations and delusions; difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking; urinary problems or constipation; skin problems; and sleep disruptions.\n\nThe effectiveness of Nuplazid was shown in a six-week clinical trial of 199 participants. Nuplazid was shown to be superior to placebo in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions without worsening the primary motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.\n\nAs with other atypical antipsychotic drugs, Nuplazid has a Boxed Warning alerting health care professionals about an increased risk of death associated with the use of these drugs to treat older people with dementia-related psychosis. No drug in this class is approved to treat patients with dementia-related psychosis.\n\nIn clinical trials, the most common side effects reported by participants taking Nuplazid were: swelling, usually of the ankles, legs, and feet due to the accumulation of excessive fluid in the tissue (peripheral edema); nausea; and abnormal state of mind (confused state).\n\nNuplazid was granted breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease. Breakthrough therapy designation is a program designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. The drug was also granted a priority review. The FDA’s priority review program provides for an expedited review of drugs that offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.\n\nNuplazid is marketed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Diego, California.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###\n\nInquiries Media: Sandy Walsh 301-796-4669 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA\n\nRelated Information']",An anti-psychotic drug that was given priority regulatory review is now on its way to market. The release on the drug’s approval skims over the benefits and the slim evidence which could leave readers with questions about the drug’s safety and effectiveness.,"This news release from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announces the agency’s recent approval of a new drug marketed as Nuplazid (pimavanserin) for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The release leaves several crucial questions unanswered. We’re not told how much the drug will cost or how significant is the improvement offered by Nuplazid over placebo. A recent article in Stat that summarized an FDA panel’s recommendation to approve the drug, which the FDA followed, found that “In the pivotal trial behind Acadia’s marketing application, Nuplazid showed only modest improvements over placebo, and was tested in a way that makes it difficult to compare against other treatments.”
A public memo from the FDA on Nuplazid seems to suggest for about every two patients who are expected to benefit greatly from Nuplazid, another patient will suffer a significant side effect.
The release provides very little quantitative information but spends a great deal of time explaining the many symptoms of PD.
