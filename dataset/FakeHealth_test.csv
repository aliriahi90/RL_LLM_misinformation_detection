The other eight were exposed to 60 minutes of continuous bright light. Those who experienced the flashing light were more quickly able to alter their circadian clock and thus, in theory, more quickly adapt to a new time zone.  The report covered the main bases found in the published research and, unlike a CNN article on the same study, included the helpful commentary of an outside observer who was able to add context to the meaning and impact of the study.

The 539 men completing the two studies, who were randomly assigned to the real drug or the fake version, had an average time of less than 36 seconds before they took part in the research. That meant the drug was linked to a 5.5-fold increase in time before ejaculation, compared to a 1.6-fold gain for the placebo.\n\nThe increase is ""clinically significant,"" says Tom Lue, a professor of urology at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn\'t involved in the research. ""People will be much happier.""\n\nThe primary findings of both trials had previously been made public, but researchers combined them and added new data in abstracts set to be presented Tuesday at the American Urological Association\'s annual meeting in San Francisco. The studies lasted three months, but researchers allowed participants to choose to continue with the drug. Its effectiveness apparently didn\'t diminish over a span as long as nine additional months.\n\nMen who used the spray rated their sexual experiences significantly higher on measures of control and satisfaction, and reported less distress than those who got placebo, according to the researchers.\n\nThe spray, currently referred to as PSD502, hasn\'t won regulatory approval to be marketed. The company that owns rights to the product, Japan\'s Shionogi & Co. Ltd., says it hopes to apply to the Food and Drug Administration and is already in discussions with the agency.\n\nDoctors are not sure what causes men to have the problem, which may involve an abnormality of the central nervous system or extreme nerve sensitivity in the penis that leads ejaculation to be triggered. Psychological factors may also play a role.\n\nTreatment for premature ejaculation has long been seen as a potentially lucrative opportunity for drug makers, which found major success with drugs for erectile dysfunction, a condition that was also once considered taboo for public discussion. Surveys have suggested that as many as 20% to 30% of men may suffer from premature ejaculation, though these figures are often drawn from broadly worded survey questions and may overstate the number of men with significant problems.\n\nThe field suffered a setback in 2005, when the FDA rejected an application from Johnson & Johnson to market a drug called Priligy; the agency doesn\'t typically reveal its reasons for such decisions publicly. To date no treatment has won the FDA\'s nod for use in premature ejaculation. The J&J drug, which works similarly to antidepressants such as Prozac, has been approved for use in 12 countries, including Germany and South Korea. A company spokeswoman says Johnson & Johnson is ""evaluating its path forward in the U.S."" for Priligy.\n\nIn the U.S., men can try certain antidepressants or numbing creams, which aren\'t FDA-approved for premature ejaculation, or work with a sex therapist or psychologist. These are ""less-than-perfect alternatives,"" says Anthony Smith, a urologist at the University of New Mexico who was not involved in the research on PSD502.\n\nThe spray may work by damping excessive sensitivity, says Ira Sharlip, a clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco who was involved in the PSD502 research. It is sprayed on the tip of the penis five minutes before sex. In the studies, men and their partners were given stopwatches to time the length of their intercourse.\n\nDr. Sharlip says the spray doesn\'t generally lead to numbness, a problem men might fear from a product involving lidocaine, which many associate with killing the pain of dental procedures. Prilocaine is also sometimes used as a numbing agent in dentistry. About 6.9% of the men reported side effects, with the most common being loss of erection, seen in 3%, or at least some loss of sensation, in 1.7%. Also, 0.6% of the men\'s female partners reported at least some loss of sensation. In all cases, the issues were temporary, the researchers said.\n\nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com']","A reasonable job of reporting on two small studies of a spray used to delay ejaculation. The results have not been peer-reviewed or published, but they are being used by the company involved in the research to drum up interest in the spray in the run up to an FDA application.","The one thing we didn’t like in the story was letting the independent urologist get away with his claim that the findings were ""clinically significant.""  We liked the way one observer put it in an online comment posted after the WSJ online story:

By introducing the immune system to a potential future enemy, antibodies against that invader are ready to attack when the time comes. In this case, the vaccine introduces a piece of the heroin molecule to the immune system. In response, this protective system manufactures antibodies to the drug, including the components that cause the high.\n\nAs a result, those molecules never reach the brain, preventing the euphoria that may have otherwise resulted. The absence of a high could help recovering heroin users resist the temptation to relapse, the researchers say.\n\nSubscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe current study of the vaccine, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, follows eight years of laboratory research and studies in rodents that indicated the compound could neutralize heroin at different doses.\n\nHere, the Scripps investigators, working with researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University, tested the vaccine on four rhesus monkeys. The animals were given three doses of the vaccine, which elicited a successful immune response that neutralized heroin given at varying doses. The high-blocking effects of the vaccine were strongest during the first month but continued for more than eight months. The researchers did not observe any harmful side effects from the intervention.\n\nRelated: Opioid epidemic and overdose deaths blamed on pharma in Ohio lawsuit\n\nTwo of the animals had been exposed to the vaccine seven months before for a similar pilot study. All four monkeys responded to the vaccine, but the two that were receiving it a second time had a stronger response, hinting that their immune systems were already primed with the “memory” of the compound.\n\nMark Thomas, who researches addiction at the University of Minnesota Health Sciences, says that a vaccine like this could help a former heroin abuser, “forge a path to abstinence.” Thomas, who was not involved with the study, explains that he was initially wary of the vaccine approach. He figured that a person who is dependent on drugs would find a replacement if heroin no longer caused a high.\n\n“It’s not going to be a panacea,” says Thomas. But in light of the growing drug abuse epidemic, for which, he says, “we have so few tools,” adding a vaccine to the available treatments could help. “It’s an avenue that shows some promise.”\n\nRelated: Yes, drug laws absolutely hurt HIV prevention and treatment, study confirms\n\nAlthough research on humans is not yet planned, study authors Kim Janda and Paul Bremer, chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, are encouraged about this next step. Other anti-heroin vaccines have proved ineffective for people, but this compound is the first to work in primates. “We believe this vaccine candidate will prove safe for human trials,” said Janda in a statement.\n\nImportantly, this vaccine is designed to work against only heroin, not other opioids. Bremer and Janda now hope to find a company interested in conducting a human study so that the vaccine can become commercially available.\n\nRelated: CDC study finds opioid dependency begins within a few days of initial use']","To its credit, the story did include some comments from an independent expert who discussed how the vaccine–if it ever comes to market–would not be a “panacea” for heroin addiction.","Credit: Paul Asman and Jill Lenoble
The story describes early development of a vaccine for blocking the high from heroin. The story, especially the headline, makes the leap that because it’s worked in a few monkeys, it will work in people (and be safe). It’s just too soon in the scientific research process for anyone to know if this “vaccine” will work in people.

But this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts, so it\'s not used in public spaces.\n\nHowever, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option.\n\nIn prior studies, they found that far-UVC light killed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria -- a common and dangerous ""superbug"" -- without harming human or mouse skin.\n\nIn this new study, they found that far-UVC light also killed airborne H1N1 virus, a common strain of flu virus.\n\n""Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it\'s not a human health hazard,"" said Brenner, who directs Columbia\'s Center for Radiological Research.\n\nHowever, ""because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach their DNA and kill them,"" he said in a university news release.\n\nLamps with this type of UV light currently cost less than $1,000, Brenner said, but that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass-produced.\n\n""And unlike flu vaccines, far-UVC is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, even newly emerging strains,"" he said.\n\nTwo flu experts were encouraged by the findings.\n\n""The prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using far-UV radiation is very exciting,"" said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.\n\n""Though hand-washing remains critically important, it does not prevent every instance of transmission,"" Grosso said. ""Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations. It appears that low-dose far-UV light is safe and effective, and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease-causing viruses.""\n\nDr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed.\n\nHe noted that the technology\'s cost ""is not prohibitive, and it is safe. This use can sterilize the air in a public space, reducing the spread of respiratory droplets containing flu viruses and other bacteria and viruses.""\n\nThe findings were published online Feb. 9 in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on flu.']","The story used speculative language from the start (“powerful” new disinfectant,” “easily kills”) and had a startling lack of information about the study.","A scene from the promotional video Columbia University produced about the study.
Full-spectrum ultraviolet C light (UVC) is already used to sterilize things like drinking water and surgical equipment. However, extended exposure can cause skin cancer and cataracts.
The news story reports a narrower spectrum, far-UVC light, was successful in killing a strain of flu virus and might have potential as a disinfectant. Previous studies by the same authors are cited that suggest this can be accomplished without the skin and eye damage seen with full spectrum UVC light.
This story does not mention that this test was conducted in a very small test chamber (not a room), and it’s unclear whether these results could be applied in “indoor public places” as the story implies.
More worrisome, the piece used speculative language from the start (“powerful” new disinfectant,” “easily kills”) and had a startling lack of information about the study. But, to its credit, this article mentioned the importance of preventive measures when it comes to the flu–something the TIME Health story (we also reviewed) lacked.

Such conclusions have been well examined in the general population, where a recommended exercise program of 30 minutes at least five days a week (or 150 minutes per week) has been shown to reduce the average risk of death by 30 percent.\n\nHowever, such a correlation between the level of physical activity and risk of death has not been so clearly determined in the elderly. Indeed, most physical activity guidelines are the same for the middle-aged adults as for the elderly, even though it is estimated that over 60% of the elderly are unable to achieve this same level of exercise.\n\nNow, a study in a French cohort of more than 1000 elderly subjects (the PROOF study) has found a negative correlation between their level of physical activity and risk of all-cause death, suggesting that in the elderly (as in other population groups) the risk of death decreases with greater and more regular exercise.\n\nThe results of the study are presented today at EuroPRevent 2015 by Dr David Hupin from the Department of Clinical and Exercise Physiology at the University Hospital of St-Etienne-Lyon, France.1\n\nSubjects were enrolled in the study at age 65 in 2001 and followed-up for 13 years. During that follow-up their level of physical activity was monitored and categorised according to five levels of MET-h values per week: <1; 1-3.74; 3-75-7.49 (equivalent to brisk walking for up to 150 minutes per week, and the recommended activity level); 7.5-15; and >15 MET-h per week.2 Mortality and cardiovascular events were recorded over the follow-up period and associated with exercise levels.\n\nResults showed that around 10% of the eligible cohort died during the follow-up period. However, the risk of death was calculated to be 57% lower in those whose activity level was equal to or higher than the recommended 150 minutes per week (7.5-15 MET-h per week). And furthermore, those doing a very low level of physical activity per week (1-3.74 MET-h/week) had 51% lower risk of death than those doing the very minimum (<1 MET-h/week). These differences in risk were statistically significant.\n\nThere were other significant findings too - notably that starting or restarting physical activity during retirement reduced the risk of death by two-thirds, but in contrast any reduction, even in low levels of activity, exposed the elderly to a higher risk of death.\n\nIn commenting on the results, Dr Hupin said several conclusions might be drawn but notably that the level of physical activity in the elderly was negatively associated with mortality rate in a ""dose-dependent"" way and that even a low level of exercise below current recommendations had some protective effect.\n\nAs a simple rule for the elderly Dr Hupin recommended that at least 15 minutes of physical activity for five days a week would be a suitable first target for the elderly. ""This could include brisk walking, cycling, swimming or gymnastics,"" he suggested, ""all possibly associated with leisure time physical activity or daily life activities.""\n\nDr Hupin emphasised that the widespread acceptance of this message would encourage more elderly people to include even ""low doses"" of physical activity in their usual daily activities, without experiencing high levels of fatigue or of pain. ""This message should be relayed by general practitioners, who play a key and essential role in promoting exercise behaviour in the elderly,"" he said. ""Even a little is good, and more may be better.""\n\nThe findings from this PROOF study were confirmed in a meta-analysis preformed by the same group and reported at this same EuroPRevent congress.3 This analysis, drawing on data involving almost 120,000 subjects, found that ""low-dose"" moderate-to-vigorous physical activity - of, say, 75 minutes per week or 15 minutes per day - significantly reduced mortality in the elderly. Based on the results, Dr Hupin said that a revision of the recommendations for physical activity in the elderly may thus be warranted and beneficial - low dose physical activity can significantly reduce mortality. In this meta-analysis a low dose of activity resulted in a mortality rate reduction of 22%.\n\n###\n\nDid you want to tweet about our congress? - if you do, please use the official #Europrevent hashtag!

Although the release does a thorough job explaining what the researchers did in this study, it inflates the benefits data by reporting figures in terms of relative risk reduction. In addition, it’s unclear what this study brings to the existing scientific knowledge on aging and physical activity, since we found other published research studying this link that’s not mentioned.
But the biggest deficiency is the release’s failure to point out any of the study’s potential biases or limitations. And that’s the very same problem that has already gotten the ESC nominated to our News Release Wall of Shame in the past. The study looked at a group of elderly people, many of whom are likely to have health problems (perhaps unrecognized health problems) that affect both their risk of death and their ability to exercise. Trying to isolate the effects of physical activity in such a group is a very tricky proposition, but the release never expresses so much as a hint of doubt regarding the findings. While we agree that exercise at any age is likely to be beneficial, we think researchers and communications professionals should provide a balanced view of a study’s strengths and limitations in their news releases. Otherwise, news coverage of the study will also reflect a lopsided view of the findings.

But it takes no position on MRI imaging for women who have had breast cancer, saying there is not enough evidence to recommend one way or the other.\n\nStudying the effectiveness of MRI screening on all three groups of women, Dr. Wendy DeMartini, an assistant professor of radiology at the University of Washington Medical School, said MRI imaging found proportionally more cancers in women who had been treated for breast cancer than in the women considered at very high risk.\n\n""Women in the personal history group [who had MRI] were also less likely to be recalled for additional testing, and less likely to have a biopsy for a false positive finding,"" she said.\n\nDeMartini was scheduled to present the findings Sunday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago.\n\nFor the study, her team reviewed initial breast MRI exams of 1,026 women, conducted from January 2004 to June 2009. Of these, 327 had a genetic or family history; 646 had a personal history of breast cancer that had been treated.\n\nOverall, the MRI detected 25 of 27 cancers, DeMartini said. With the MRI screen, ""we found cancer in just over 3 percent of women [with a personal history], which was double [that found in those with a genetic or family history],"" she said.\n\nHowever, still more research is needed to clarify the role of MRI in this population, she said.\n\n""The findings are impressive,"" said Dr. Robert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society. While the society recommends neither for nor against MRI imaging for those with a personal history of breast cancer, he said it regularly reviews study findings to determine if the guidelines need updating.\n\n""There are some tumors that don\'t show up on mammography as well as they do on MRI,"" he explained. MRI highlights angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, especially those that feed cancerous tissues.\n\nUntil more research is in, what should a woman with a personal history of breast cancer do?\n\n""She should talk to her doctor,"" Smith said. He doesn\'t see a downside to getting an MRI, except perhaps an increased risk of false positives and perhaps a need to pay out of pocket.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about breast cancer screening, visit the American Cancer Society.']","<span style=""font-size: larger;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">There are gaping holes in this story about a study of MRI in women who have had breast cancer.</span></span>","



The story says the study indicates benefits of annual MRI testing, but the study looked at just one-time imaging, not annual scans. Does adding MRI to conventional mammography improve survival? This study can’t answer that question. It didn’t include any data to compare MRI to mammography and it didn’t measure survival. It refers to women with a history of breast cancer without addressing questions about whether the women in this study actually represent typical cases. It brushes off concerns about costs, false positive results and other potential harms of such additional imaging tests. It neglects to report that the senior researcher is a consultant to a company that manufactures MRI scanners. It doesn’t explain what makes this particular study on MRI for breast cancer noteworthy in comparison to all the other studies that have been done recently.

What\'s more, the drug carries a risk of bone damage, stunted growth and heart trouble, and can render children impotent.\n\nThese experts contend that Lupron, costing about $5,000 a month but seldom covered by insurance, is one of many treatments that cash in on the desperation of parents trying to cope with an incurable condition for which medicine has few good answers outside of painstaking behavioral therapy.\n\n""Not only is there no scientific backing whatsoever for Lupron treatments, there are several major concerns for the children\'s health,"" said neurologist BethAnn McLaughlin, an adviser to the Dan Marino Foundation autism group in Weston and the mother of two developmentally disabled children.\n\n""These people are preying on the fears of parents. We cannot be using these children who are so vulnerable as guinea pigs in a medical experiment.""\n\nUntested autism treatments have flourished while science struggles to explain the disorder, which disrupts the abilities to speak, concentrate, connect with people and control impulses.\n\nFor unknown reasons, autism has been on the rise for the past few decades, with an estimated 675,000 children – about one in 100 – now having mild to severe symptoms. Scientists believe it stems from genetic defects that may only cause problems after an environmental trigger.\n\nA vocal subset of parents and activists blame vaccines, especially those with the mercury-based preservative thimerosal, which has been banned from virtually all as a precaution. Numerous studies have found no connection between autism and vaccines or thimerosal.\n\nLupron therapy grew from the mercury camp. Baltimore researcher Dr. Mark Geier started using the drug in 2005 on the theory – disputed by mainsteam doctors – that testosterone binds mercury in the body and that many autistic kids have high levels of the hormone.\n\nLupron halts production of the female hormone estrogen, which the body uses to make testosterone. The drug mainly is used to treat endometrial cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, and sometimes to chemically castrate sex offenders.\n\nGeier\'s promotional materials said he has treated hundreds of children with Lupron and has launched nine ASD Centers in eight states. In his latest, he teams with Dr. David Clayman, a Boca Raton radiologist who has an autistic teen son and is opening an ASD office beside his MRI center in Tamarac.\n\nClayman said he would not comment until he treats patients with Lupron therapy for a year. Geier could not be reached for comment despite several attempts by phone. He told one parent he did not plan to comment for this story.\n\nThe medical group began recruiting Florida patients in March when Geier spoke at a Fort Lauderdale conference for parents of children with autism.\n\nTeresa Badillo was at the meeting. Her family has searched in vain for a way to help their autistic son, Marco, 18. Badillo said he has little speech or interaction with others, but is doing OK in high school. Lately, though, Marco has grown more aggressive, physical and rebellious.\n\n""We were basically under seige in this house,"" Badillo said. ""This kind of behavior is more scary at 18 [than] at 3. I had choices to make. If you see there is another option out there that can help your child, most parents are going to choose that option.""\n\nAlso, Marco had discovered sex and sometimes touched himself inappropriately in public, a common problem among those with autism.\n\n""The kids don\'t understand. They have impulses. It\'s what happens when you have high testosterone,"" Badillo said.\n\nThe family put Marco on Lupron about six weeks ago.

These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.\n\nFailing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.\n\nThe United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nOnly 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.\n\n""This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,"" said lead author Dr. Matthew O\'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we\'re proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.""\n\nThe study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O\'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\n\nThe USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group\'s most recent diabetes screening guideline.\n\nIntensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.\n\n""The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,"" O\'Brien said.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O\'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.\n\nAsians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.\n\nThe study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O\'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.\n\n""This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,"" O\'Brien said.\n\nThe study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. It builds on findings from a previous study O\'Brien conducted that incorporated electronic health record data from 50,515 adult primary care patients at community health centers in the Midwest and Southwest between 2008 and 2013.\n\n###\n\nOther Northwestern authors are senior author Dr. Ronald Ackermann and co-authors Mercedes Carnethon and Dr. Namratha Kandula. The other co-authors were from the CDC. Dr. Ronald Ackermann is the study\'s senior author.\n\nThe study was funded by grants R21-DK112066, R01-HL093009 and ULI-TR001422 from the National Center for Health Statistics of the National Institute of Health.']",This release challenges one set of recommendations for who should be screened for “prediabetes” and type 2 diabetes but doesn’t offer strong evidence to make its claim that expanded screening is the answer.,"This news release analyzes results from a study comparing two approaches to screening for diabetes in order to compare their test characteristics, basically the true versus false positives.
The release is light on data supporting its claims that screening guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) pick up too few people when they recommend physicians screen patients that are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. The Northwestern release suggests these guidelines miss African-Americans and Latinos since they tend to develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages. But it’s also possible that the USPSTF recommendations are already too expansive and catch far too many people under the “dysglycemia” label — a broad term including both “prediabetes” and type 2 diabetes — and therefore harm many who end up being medically diagnosed, labeled and “treated” for a condition that may never go on to hurt them.  We can’t lose sight of the fact that high blood sugars is a surrogate marker, the modification of which may never have any clinical benefits, and in fact could be harmful. Maybe the “dysglycemic” term batches together almost everyone on the planet who could, by definition, either be prediabetic or diabetic, which is most of us.

Our reviewers describe what’s missing.,"A 25% reduction in cardiovascular events, including death, heart attack or stroke sounds like a big deal… and maybe it is. But this story about the results of a trial of a prescription drug derived from fish oil (brand name Vascepa) relies on a news release and company statements that don’t provide basic information about the precise number or type of cardiovascular events observed by researchers. Without absolute numbers, it is impossible to judge the importance of these results. It is also premature to claim that the results represent “heart-medicine history,” especially given that the findings haven’t been peer-reviewed and are at odds with numerous previous studies.
The story takes a cheerleading tone and fails to supply key context. For example, it highlights a dramatic quote from a researcher without noting that he was paid over $120,000 by the drug company, including payments for speeches and other appearances on its behalf, in 2017. The story headline and text do make clear that only patients with cardiovascular disease and high levels of triglycerides or diabetes were in the trial, so it should be clear to readers that this drug was not shown to prevent disease in healthy people. The story does not give any details about potential harms of the drug. It reports key details of the trial, but without access to the full trial report, it is impossible to judge the quality of the evidence or its real significance.

And, when suspected trouble foods were reintroduced into the diet, two-thirds of the children experienced a relapse in symptoms.\n\n""A strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether ADHD is induced by food,"" wrote the study authors. ""We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD, provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a five-week period, and provided expert supervision is available,"" they concluded.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Feb. 5 issue of The Lancet.\n\nADHD is a common childhood disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Children with ADHD have trouble paying attention, focusing and can be hyperactive. Parents have long suspected that sugary foods might be a culprit in inducing symptoms, but there\'s not a lot of evidence to support this theory, according to the NIMH. However, food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children\'s behavior, though the evidence isn\'t yet conclusive.\n\nSince some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods -- such as eczema, asthma and gastrointestinal problems -- that affect different organ systems, it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior, according to information in the study.\n\nTo test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The children were between the ages of 4 and 8, and all had been diagnosed with ADHD. Most of the children were boys.\n\nThe children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet, and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating.\n\nThe restrictive diet began with a diet called the ""few foods diet,"" which includes just rice, meat, vegetables, pears and water. The researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods, such as potatoes, fruits and wheat. The restrictive diet lasted for five weeks.\n\nDuring the next four weeks, kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets, in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods.\n\nIgG is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities; however, IgG testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths, according to background information in the study.\n\nSome complementary medicine practices test for IgG and recommend eliminating foods high in IgG, explained Dr. Jaswinder Ghuman, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal.\n\nForty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet. Of those, 78 percent had a reduction in their ADHD symptoms, compared with no improvement in the controls. Nine children (22 percent) didn\'t respond to the diet. On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.\n\nThirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. What\'s more, it didn\'t appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low- or high-IgG food.\n\n""Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn\'t seem helpful,"" Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.\n\n""If parents have noticed that a child\'s behavior seems to get worse with certain foods, it may be worth considering,"" said Ghuman, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\n""But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition. It should be done under the supervision of a primary care doctor, and if possible, a dietician,"" she advised.\n\nGhuman said that this study doesn\'t answer a number of questions, such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long-term. And, she added, that clinical practice shouldn\'t be changed based on the results of one study.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children\'s Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, echoed Ghuman\'s concerns.\n\n""Since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks, it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit,"" he said, adding, ""Since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children, this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with ADHD.""\n\nAdesman also pointed out that this study is only applicable to children with ADHD, not to children who had ADD without the hyperactivity component.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about ADHD from the National Institute of Mental Health.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story fell short on enough of our marks to give it an average score but, in comparison to its <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3593"" target=""_blank"">WebMD competitor</a> on this particular topic, it excelled.</span>","This story presented a more cautious view than the WebMD story we reviewed on a study suggesting that a restrictive diet may help ease the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Survival was shown to be greatest among those prescribed first-generation nonselective beta-blockers. According to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center investigators, the drugs block the effects of stress pathways involved in tumor growth and spread. With further research, they may also prove beneficial in conjunction with other treatment regimens and across other cancer types.\n\nPublished today in the journal CANCER, the findings are the result of a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of the medical records of 1,425 women with ovarian cancer treated between 2000 and 2010. Researchers compared overall survival among patients with documented beta-blocker use during chemotherapy and those without. Among the 269 patients who received beta-blockers, 193 (71.7 percent) received beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents (SBBs) and the remaining patients received nonselective beta antagonists (NSBBs). The research team found:\n\nFor patients receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers.\n\nMedian overall survival based on beta-blocker receptor selectivity was 94.9 months for those receiving NSBBs versus 38 months for those receiving SBBs.\n\nEven among patients with hypertension, a longer median overall survival was observed among users of NSBBs compared with nonusers (90 months versus 38.2 months).\n\nThis study builds on a large body of research by principal investigator Anil Sood, M.D., professor in Gynecologic Medical Oncology and Cancer Biology at MD Anderson. It showed that stress hormones fuel progression of ovarian and other cancers, and that beta-blockers - among the most proven drugs in cardiovascular medicine - might be a new way to stifle that effect.\n\n""Beta-blockers treat a variety of conditions, such as heart disease, high-blood pressure, glaucoma and migraines. They target a receptor protein in heart muscle that causes the heart to beat harder and faster when activated by stress hormones,"" Sood said. ""Our research has shown that the same stress mechanisms impact ovarian cancer progression, so these drugs could play a new role in cancer treatment.""\n\nAccording to Sood, the usefulness of beta-blockers was unclear until now. ""The ability to show improved survival using nonselective agents - which inhibit a specific stress pathway - is the culmination of years of research into ovarian cancer biology and pathogenesis.""\n\nHe added that beta-blocker users in the study presented at a higher stage of disease, had an increased average BMI and were more likely to be hypertensive. All these factors were associated with decreased survival, yet those who received beta-blockers had either equivalent or improved overall survival. Further examination revealed that NSBB users had improved overall survival regardless of the presence of such prognostic factors or comorbidities. This was not true for patients who took SBBs.\n\nAlthough further study is needed, these results highlight the importance of adrenergic receptor-β2 (ADRB2), a signaling pathway important to ovarian carcinogenesis and targeted by NSBBs (versus the ADRB1 pathway targeted by SBBs).\n\nOvarian cancer is the 5th most deadly cancer among women, accounting for more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer. An estimated 21,290 new cases are diagnosed, and some 14,180 women die from the disease each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nFuture trials will seek to identify patients who would benefit most from beta-blocker use and the best beta-blocker for a specific tumor type based on adrenergic receptor expression. Then they potentially could be used as an adjuvant therapy during surgical recovery and chemotherapy to decrease tumor growth, delays in wound healing and metastasis. Beta-blockers may also reduce cancer-related psychological distress in newly diagnosed patients, according to the study authors.\n\nThere are currently two clinical trials, one led by MD Anderson, evaluating the combination of chemotherapy and propranolol (a type of NSBB) on cancer biology and on stress modulators in patients with newly diagnosed EOC. According to Sood, the preliminary data from these feasibility trials will be used to design prospective, randomized clinical trials examining NSBBs on patient outcomes.\n\n""The stratification of patients by beta-blocker use and selectivity in this study makes it unique among all other studies examining the impact of these drugs on cancer. It also builds on the mounting evidence that beta-blockers may become a key treatment component for many patients in the future,"" said Sood.\n\n###\n\nPortions of this study were supported by National Institutes of Health grants (CA140933, CA104825, CA109298, P50CA083639, U54CA151688, U54CA96300, U54CA96297, and CA016672), an Ovarian Cancer Research Fund program Project Development Grant, the Department of Defense (grants OC073399, W81XWJ-10-0158, and OC100237), the Betty Ann Asche Murray Distinguished Professorship, the RGK Foundation, the Gilder Foundation, the Blanton-Davis Ovarian Cancer Research Program, and a Gynecologic Cancer Foundation-St. Louis Ovarian Cancer Awareness grant.

The study is published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nChronic neck pain is a leading cause of disability. Usual care for neck pain generally consists of prescribed medications and visits to physical therapists and other health care professionals. In addition, persons with chronic neck pain often seek complimentary care to manage their condition, such as acupuncture or the Alexander Technique. Acupuncture is a procedure in which patients have thin needles inserted into specific points on the body to relieve pain and the Alexander Technique is an educational process that teaches people how to avoid unnecessary muscular and mental tension in everyday activities.\n\nResearchers sought to determine the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture or Alexander Technique lessons compared with usual care for persons with chronic, nonspecific neck pain. Patients were randomly assigned to 12 acupuncture sessions or 20 one-to-one Alexander Technique lessons plus usual care, or usual care only. Neck pain was assessed by the Northwick Park Questionnaire (NPQ) at 3, 6, and 12 months.\n\nThe researchers found that acupuncture and the Alexander Technique lessons both led to a significant reduction in neck pain at 12 months compared with usual care alone. Both interventions had a high rate of acceptability, and greater adherence was associated with better pain outcomes. Over time, both interventions resulted in a greater increase in self-efficacy than did usual care, and these improvements were associated with better NPQ outcomes.\n\n###\n\nNote: For an embargoed PDF, please contact Cara Graeff.

The latest study comes down in favor of virtue: It says that drinking coffee, whether regular or decaf, could reduce the risk of death.\n\nResearchers started with data from surveys of adults in the United States that asked how much coffee they consumed, as well as other foods and drinks, and then they looked at their rates of death and disease over the following two decades.\n\nThe study was large, including more than 200,000 women and 50,000 men.\n\nAt first, researchers did not see an obvious relationship between coffee consumption and death rates. Study participants who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 5% to 9% lower risk of dying than those who drank no coffee. Those who drank more than three cups a day did not see any benefit. The finding was murky, like previous studies, some of which suggested a benefit and some did not.\n\nBut when the researchers looked at coffee consumption only among people who said they never smoked, the relationship became clearer: Those who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 6% to 8% lower risk of dying than noncoffee drinkers.

The headline — “Coffee could literally be a lifesaver” — is overblown given the types of evidence we’re talking about. But the story otherwise does a worthy and responsible job of framing the study’s weaknesses and strengths, particularly so in explaining confounding factors and why so many coffee studies historically have yielded “murky” results. It also takes a pretty good stab at exploring the study’s suggestion that natural chemicals in the coffee may be responsible for the beverage’s potential health benefits, an effort that was essentially missing from a story in STAT that was otherwise much stronger in describing the strengths and weaknesses of this and all observational studies. The CNN story also aptly noted the novel analysis of coffee drinking in a non-smoking subset of the nearly 200,000 subjects. Overall, this CNN piece could have been made stronger by having outside experts comment on the findings, as the STAT piece did to excellent effect; by offering more qualitative details about the sources of the data; by noting that in excessive quantities, the new study identified a slight increase in risk of death; and — as the STAT piece did superbly, noting the likely “benefits” in terms of absolute risk (very, very small).

In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine.\n\nThe trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea\'s Ministry of Health and other international partners.\n\n""While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa\'s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,"" said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO\'s Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study\'s lead author [4].\n\nThe vaccine\'s manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted.\n\nSince Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine.\n\nThe trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called ""ring vaccination"" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox.\n\nWhen a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain ""contacts of contacts"". A total of 117 clusters (or ""rings"") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people.\n\nInitially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine\'s efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years.\n\nIn addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so-called ""herd immunity""). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed.\n\n""Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured"" said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea [4].\n\nTo assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects.\n\nIt was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea.\n\n""This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,"" said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, Specialist Director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group [4].\n\nIn January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO\'s Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.\n\nAdditional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called ""compassionate use"" that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO\'s partners are working to compile data to support license applications.\n\nThe rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO\'s R&D; Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.\n\nAlso published in The Lancet (embargo as above), is a phase 2 trial of a different Ebola vaccine candidate, the recombinant adenovirus type-5 Ebola vaccine. The trial was led by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and was conducted in Sierra Leone in 2015. It involved 500 healthy participants, followed for 6 months - 250 were given a high dose vaccine, 125 a low-dose and 125 a placebo. The study found that the vaccine was safe and induced an immune response that peaked at 28 days, but decreased during the six months post injection. One serious adverse event was reported, in an individual with a history of asthma. Further research on this vaccine is needed in order to assess its efficacy.\n\n###\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nThe rVSV-ZEBOV trial is funded by WHO, with support from the Wellcome Trust, the United Kingdom Department for International Development, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health through the Research Council of Norway, the Canadian Government through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, International Development Research Centre and Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development and Médecins Sans Frontières.\n\nThe trial team includes experts from The University of Bern, the University of Florida, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Public Health England, the European Mobile Laboratories among others. The trial was designed by a group of experts including the late Professor Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort by using the ring vaccination strategy.\n\n[1] http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)61117-5/abstract\n\n[2] VSV-EBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans.\n\n[3] Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus.\n\n[4] Quotes direct from authors and cannot be found in the text of the Article.']",A reference to cost and the other Ebola vaccines under concurrent development by major pharmaceutical competitors would have made the release even stronger.,"This news release discusses the results of a World Health Organization-led study of an experimental Ebola vaccine manufactured by Merck, Sharpe & Dohme. The study tested the effectiveness of the vaccine (currently referred to as rVSV-ZEBOV) among individuals who had come in contact with people diagnosed with Ebola within three weeks prior to the diagnosis, including contacts of those contacts, using a “ring vaccination” approach similar to that used to fight smallpox in the mid- to late 20th century. Among the 5,837 individuals who were vaccinated immediately after assignment to the study, none developed Ebola 10 days or more after being enrolled. In comparison, there were 23 Ebola cases identified 10 days or more in the group of 4,507 assigned to either a delayed vaccination (16 cases) or no vaccination (7 cases).  
The release delivers a good description of harms, is written in a balanced and non-sensational tone, and provides an overview of next steps for the vaccine. The release would have been improved with some reference to cost and the other Ebola vaccines under development by major pharmaceutical competitors.

(Nasdaq: HOLX) announced that study results published today in a research letter in JAMA conclude that breast tomosynthesis (Hologic\'s Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™) exams reduce recall rates, and increase invasive cancer detection in women with both dense and nondense breasts. These key benefits of 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ could lower the costs associated with needless follow-up exams, and improve patient experience for women seeking a more accurate screening mammogram.\n\nDensity is only identifiable on a mammogram or other imaging system, and is a reflection of how much fibrous or glandular tissue is in the breast. Higher breast density may increase a woman\'s chance of getting breast cancer, make detection of cancer on conventional mammography more difficult, and increase the chances that a woman will be recalled for additional imaging.1,2 Mammograms are categorized into four density groups: almost entirely fat, scattered fibroglandular densities, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense. The latter two groups are considered dense; however, the vast majority of women whose mammograms are considered dense have heterogeneously dense breast tissue.\n\n""Density creates challenges for conventional mammography by obscuring the images, which often results in additional visits and exams for women,"" said Edward Evantash, MD, board certified OB/GYN and Medical Director for Hologic. ""This new analysis confirms that Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams reduce unnecessary follow-up exams in dense-breasted women. This has the potential to provide health systems and insurance companies with significant cost savings, reduce patient stress and expenses, and alleviate challenges for referring physicians who are tasked with relaying mammography results to their patients.""\n\nImprovements in both recall rate reduction and invasive cancer detection were greatest for women with heterogeneously dense breasts, with a 50 percent increase in invasive cancer detection and a simultaneous 14 percent reduction in recall rate. Women with heterogeneously dense breasts make up about 40 percent of the U.S. screening population (women ages 40-74) — approximately 25 million women in the U.S.\n\n""Utilizing Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams for breast cancer screening will reduce the need for subsequent unnecessary testing, and decrease the number of unnecessary breast biopsies— addressing concerns that were previously raised as limitations of conventional mammography while also reducing costs for health systems,"" said Pete Valenti, Hologic\'s Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions. ""Twenty-six states have passed legislation requiring doctors to notify women if they have dense breasts — and now these women who were previously confused about how to proceed with breast cancer screening can feel confident turning to 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams to reduce their chances of stressful recalls and help find more invasive cancer.""\n\nThis study brought together the principal investigators from the groundbreaking 2014 study on 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams, also published in JAMA, this time led by Elizabeth Rafferty, MD, a co-author on the prior study.3 A total of 452,320 examinations (278,906 conventional mammograms compared to 173,414 Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams), were analyzed.\n\nGenius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams have been available in the U.S. since 2011, and are only available on the Hologic Selenia® Dimensions® mammography system.

""They then looked at the extent to which brain activity from one region was synchronized with brain activity from another region,"" a phenomenon known as ""EEG coherence,"" said Dawson, who was not involved in the research.\n\n""Synchronization between different brain regions indicates that those regions are functioning in a coordinated, rather than independent, fashion -- in other words, they are functionally connected and communicating with each other,"" she said.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Frank Duffy and Dr. Heidelise Als compared EEG measurements of nearly 1,000 children with and without autism. They found that the two groups had widespread differences in terms of brain connectivity.\n\nEEG revealed that the children with autism had a reduced short range connectivity, indicating poor function of local brain networks. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language.\n\nThe children with autism also had increased connectivity between brain regions that were farther apart, which might be a mechanism developed to compensate for reduced short range connectivity, the researchers said.\n\nThe research was conducted at Boston Children\'s Hospital and was published online June 25 in the journal BMC Medicine.\n\nThe use of EEG-based testing may help diagnose autism in children and may improve early detection in infants, leading to more effective treatments and coping strategies, the researchers said.\n\n""What was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied,"" Dawson noted. ""Consistent with many previous studies using EEG and functional MRI with both children and adults with autism, these investigators found that, overall, children with autism show reduced coordination (coherence) across brain regions.""\n\nShe said the findings are important because, ""they help us understand why individuals with autism have difficulty with complex behaviors, such as social interaction and language. As children\'s brains develop, the different brain regions become increasingly connected, allowing for the acquisition of complex behaviors that require coordination across different brain regions.""\n\nLanguage, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said.\n\n""This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism,"" she added. ""The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children.""\n\nAnother expert agreed.\n\n""Although autism is still principally a clinical diagnosis, this study ... may allow for a new approach to classifying children with autism and may even assist in the early identification of affected children at a younger age,"" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children\'s Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, NY.\n\nThe number of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has recently increased to one in 88.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about autism.']",Over reliance on a source from an advocacy organization leaves readers confused as to whether this study will make a difference. This story brings in the possibility of treatment when in fact the study it reports on is focused on EEG abnormalities in autism.,"You may need to read this story several times to try to understand what this new study might mean for early detection of autism spectrum disorders. It would have helped readers to have more time spent with the methods used in the study and the actual findings than in the interpretations being made by a scientist with an advocacy organization. Additional information about the patients and controls in the study would have been helpful.  For example, are they primarily newly diagnosed?

The device is approved only for dermatologists and only for use on growths that don\'t have obvious signs of cancer but still have one or two worrisome traits.\n\nThe hope is to find more melanomas sooner. Nearly all patients diagnosed with early-stage melanoma can be treated and cured, but 85 percent of patients with late-stage melanoma die from it within five years.\n\nMore than 70,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with melanoma this year, and 16 percent are diagnosed only after the disease has spread to other parts of the body, according to estimates from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nTo diagnose the disease, doctors decide which moles to remove and biopsy using an entirely visual set of guidelines involving size, shape and color. Most dermatologists easily spot late-stage lesions that have obvious signs of cancer, including irregular edges, uneven color and a width greater than 6 millimeters. But many others are tough calls.\n\n""Every day patients come in with 20 moles on their back and the dilemma is, which ones are suspicious and need to be biopsied?"" said Dr. David Pariser, former president of the American Academy of Dermatology. ""The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it,"" said Pariser, who consulted for the device\'s maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA.\n\nThe device\'s handheld attachment, about the size of a blow dryer, emits light that penetrates below the surface of the skin, taking multicolored images that reflect the depth and shape of skin growths. A computer compares these to a database of 10,000 archived images and recommends whether a biopsy should be done.\n\nIn a company-sponsored study published last year involving around 1,300 patients, some with multiple growths, doctors reported that MelaFind correctly suggested biopsies on 125 of 127 melanomas that doctors had removed. MelaFind correctly identified about 10 percent of non-cancerous growths, which was better than doctors in the study who were correct less than 4 percent of the time, on average. The study was published in the Archives of Dermatology.\n\nThe company\'s study was not intended to show that screening with the device saves lives, only that it can help improve a doctor\'s ability to spot melanoma.\n\nFor now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove.\n\n""There is no such thing as 100 percent certainty in medicine,"" said Dr. George Elias, a melanoma expert at Georgetown\'s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center who had no ties to the company or the device.\n\n""Ultimately it\'s the responsibility of the dermatologist to use his clinical judgment to make the best decision. This machine is there to help him, not replace him.""\n\nElias voted with the majority of an FDA panel that narrowly endorsed the device last year.\n\nDermatologists say it\'s too early to tell whether MelaFind will lead to fewer unnecessary biopsies.\n\n""A biopsy takes a few minutes in my hands, so if there\'s an issue with any lesion we will always biopsy, whether we have a MelaFind picture or not,"" said Dr. Leonard Goldberg, a dermatologist at the Texas Medical Center and vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, a disease awareness group that accepts donations from makers of sunscreen.\n\nMelaFind underwent a contentious, years-long review by the Food and Drug Administration, which initially rejected the device and concluded it could ""potentially cause more harm than good.""\n\nRegulators worried that the device could give physicians a false sense of certainty, leading to fewer biopsies. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device\'s feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. About 8 percent of growths scanned in the company study came back as ""unevaluable.""\n\nAt a meeting last fall, FDA scientists said Mela Sciences had not shown how its device would influence day-to-day decisions by doctors. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles. Despite these concerns, the panel of advisers narrowly backed the overall safety and efficacy of the device in a 8-7 vote.\n\nRegulators said this week that they ultimately approved the device after Mela Sciences agreed to limit its use to board-certified dermatologists who undergo a specialized training course.\n\n""The device is only good for certain lesions, and that\'s why you have to be a dermatologist to be able to classify and categorize those lesions appropriately,"" said Christy Foreman, director of FDA\'s Office of Device Evaluation.\n\nForeman said an FDA-required follow-up study would help determine how much of a benefit MelaFind represents for patients.\n\n""This device represents new technology. At the end of the day I don\'t know that this will be the best technology out there, but it is a step forward to allow continued innovation in this area,"" Foreman said.\n\nDon\'t expect to see a MelaFind machine at your next doctor\'s appointment. The company plans to bring them next year to just 200 dermatologists on the East coast, all of whom must undergo company training before they can begin using the device.\n\nDoctors will pay a one-time fee of $7,500 to lease and receive training on the device. Patients will pay $150 out of pocket for a MelaFind scan, which analysts say may limit use to more affluent patients who are willing to pay extra for the latest medical care. Mela Sciences does not plan to ask insurers to cover the device until several years from now, after it is more widely used.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This nicely written, thoroughly reported piece by the Associated Press is a very good example of how to report on new medical devices.</span>","It puts both the potential benefits and potential harms of this scanner used to detect cancerous skin lesions in the proper context. It explains that, while new to the market, the device is not a medical breakthrough. It provides cost information, for both the physicians and patients.

A new wearable medical device developed by Kumamoto University has been found to effect visceral fat loss and improve blood glucose (sugar). The current study reports clinical trial results for optimal use frequency.\n\nType 2 diabetes is a disease of systemic organ failure due to chronic hyperglycemia and inflammation from the accumulation of excess visceral fat. Metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia attenuate stress resistance in the human body and exacerbate insulin resistance. The ability of insulin to lower blood sugar levels is reduced and insulin secretion is decreased.\n\nThe heat shock response (HSR) is activated as a response to stress in the human body, but its function decreased in those with type 2 diabetes. A research team from Kumamoto University, Japan has found that by restoring the function of HSP72, the main protein of HSR, improved glucose-related abnormalities. The team found that a suitable combination of mild electrical stimulation (MES) with heat shock (HS) activated HSP72 more efficiently.\n\nThe researchers developed a belt-type medical device that uses a special type of rubber to transmit MES and HS at the same time. They then performed a clinical trial of MES + HS on 40 obese men suffering from type 2 diabetes. Results showed a decrease fasting glucose levels, a loss of visceral fat, improve insulin resistance, and a significant (-0.43%) improvement in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. About half of all subjects (52.5%) achieved less than 7.0% HbA1c, which is a treatment goal for diabetes. The first trial showed that activation of the HSR produced a large therapeutic effect.\n\nIn the researcher\'s next clinical trial, 60 obese patients with type 2 diabetes from both genders were given a 12-week treatment with the belt-shaped MES+HS medical device. Trial subjects received treatments for 60 minutes each time, and were separated into three groups of 2, 4, and 7 treatments per week. This determined the most effective treatment frequency.\n\nThe reduction in the visceral fat area was 5.37 sq. cm in the 2 treatment per week group, 14.24 sq. cm in the 4 per week group and 16.45 sq. cm in the 7 per week group. Declines in HbA1c were 0.10%, 0.36%, and 0.65% in the 2, 4, and 7 treatment-per-week groups respectively. Improvements in chronic inflammation, fatty liver markers, renal function and lipid profile were also shown. Furthermore, adding the MES+HS treatment to a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is the most often used therapeutic drug for diabetes in Japan, showed an even stronger blood glucose improvement.\n\n""This device is very easy to use since it simply attaches to the abdomen, and it has a low-impact on the patient. One can expect the effects to be similar to exercise therapy,"" said Dr. Tatsuya Kondo, who lead the research. ""Even in patients who have difficulty exercising, such as those who are overweight, elderly, or have some form of disability, this device can be expected to provide acceptable treatment in addition to conventional diabetic medical care.""\n\nThis research was posted online in the nature.com journal Scientific Reports on October 19th, 2016.\n\n###\n\n[CITATION]\n\nT.

""It is likely to change stroke treatment guidelines and clinical practice.""\n\nCampbell said tenecteplase is more effective than alteplase because of differences in the enzymes in each drug.\n\nAlthough both drugs work in the same way, tenecteplase is better at attacking and dissolving clots, and more resistant to factors that inhibit the breakdown of clots, he said.\n\nFor either drug to be most effective, it needs to be given as soon as possible after a stroke occurs. In this study, patients were given the drugs within 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke, Campbell said.\n\nAlthough tenecteplase appears to be more effective for stroke patients, it\'s not approved for that use in the United States, according to Dr. Rohan Arora, director of stroke at Long Island Jewish Hospital in Forest Hills, N.Y.\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tenecteplase for use after a heart attack, Arora said.\n\n""Tenecteplase is being widely used in developing countries, such as India,"" he said. ""One reason is it\'s cheaper than alteplase.""\n\nIn the United States, tenecteplase costs about $5,800, versus alteplase, which costs $8,000, Arora said.\n\nIn addition, tenecteplase is easier to give, requiring only a single injection, while alteplase requires an injection and an IV drip, he added.\n\nArora explained that tenecteplase is not widely used in the United States for heart attack patients because these patients are typically treated with angioplasty or heart bypass surgery.\n\nFor the new study, which did not receive drug company funding, Campbell and his colleagues randomly assigned 202 stroke patients to either alteplase or tenecteplase before surgery to remove clots.\n\nThe researchers specifically looked to see which drug was better at restoring blood flow to clot-blocked blood vessels in the brain, and which drug resulted in patients having better outcomes.\n\nThe investigators found that 22 percent of the patients treated with tenecteplase had more than 50 percent of blood flow return to the brain, compared with 10 percent of those treated with alteplase.\n\nPatients treated with tenecteplase also had better functional outcomes after 90 days than those given alteplase, the findings showed.\n\nBleeding into the brain, the most serious side effect of either drug, occurred in 1 percent of patients, regardless of which drug they received, Campbell said.\n\nThe report was published April 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on stroke, visit the National Stroke Association.']","On the flipside, it missed significant limitations to the evidence, the most significant one being that there is ","This story reported on a study that compared a newer clot-buster to treat strokes involving a blocked artery — the most common kind — to the current standard drug, alteplase (also known as tPA).

In contrast, a concussion survey commonly used by doctors was right less than 70 percent of the time.\n\nIf the experimental test pans out, ""a pediatrician could collect saliva with a swab, send it off to the lab and then be able to call the family the next day,"" says Steven Hicks, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State Hershey. Hicks helped develop the test and consults for a company that hopes to market concussion tests.\n\nA reliable test would help overcome a major obstacle in assessing and treating concussions, which affect more than one million children and adolescents in the U.S. each year. Many of the injuries are related to sports.\n\nIn most cases, concussion symptoms last only a few days. But up to 25 percent of young patients ""go on to have these prolonged headaches, fatigue, nausea, and those symptoms can last sometimes one to four months,"" Hicks says.\n\nAnd, right now, there\'s no way to know which kids are going to have long-term problems, he says.\n\n""Parents often say that their biggest concern is, \'When is my child going to be back to normal again?\' "" Hicks says. ""And that\'s something we have a very difficult time predicting.""\n\nHicks and a team of researchers have been looking for an objective test that might help.\n\nThey knew that, after a concussion, injured brain cells try to heal themselves. As a part of this process, brain cells release tiny fragments of genetic material called microRNAs. Some of these fragments eventually turn up in blood and even in saliva.\n\nThe team did an experiment that involved 50 concussion patients between the ages of 7 and 18.\n\n""When they came to our medical center and received the diagnosis of concussion, we evaluated them with some standard survey-based tools and then we also got a sample of their saliva,"" Hicks says. Most samples were collected about a week after the injury.\n\nThe team measured levels of many different microRNAs in the samples, and eventually they identified a handful that let them predict how long symptoms would last. They also identified one microRNA that predicted which children would have a specific concussion symptom: difficulties with memory and problem solving, Hicks says.\n\nA saliva test could greatly improve care for young people who don\'t have obvious symptoms of a concussion, says Manish Bhomia, an adjunct assistant professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.\n\n""A lot of children get mild concussion and oftentimes it goes ignored,"" he says.\n\nA reliable lab test would help ensure that children who have a head injury don\'t go back to school, or to the soccer field, before their brain has healed, Bhomia says.\n\nAnd microRNAs offer a promising way to assess concussions in adults as well as children, says Bhomia, whose research involves a range of ""biomarkers"" for traumatic brain injury.\n\nBut saliva may not be the best place to measure microRNAs, Bhomia says. A better option, he says, might be blood samples, which tend to contain greater numbers of the genetic fragments.']",News stories should be scrupulous about distinctions between what researchers hope to prove and what they actually tested.,"This story about a saliva test that may be able to more accurately predict how long children will feel the symptoms of a concussion confuses readers with claims that the test could improve concussion care, something the study did not look at.
We applaud the story for pointing out that the lead researcher is consulting with a company that hopes to market the test. The story also included an independent source who provided some context; however, the way those comments were reported makes it appear the test could detect brain injuries that don’t produce symptoms, when actually the study looked only at how well the test predicted the duration of symptoms.
The story also presents statistics in a way that is technically correct, but probably misleading, because it does not explain how the prevalence of a condition affects the likely meaning of test results. (Specifically, the less common a condition is, the less likely it is that a positive test result is accurate.) And as with all stories about tests, the potential harm of false positive and false negative results should have been mentioned.

Then Zzz: Tonsillectomy Helps Kids Sleep\n\ntoggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR\n\nGetting your tonsils out used to be just part of childhood — a rite of passage for children in the 1950s and \'60s. Then it fell out of favor.\n\nBut tonsillectomy is back.\n\nToday, the most common reason for the surgery is ""sleep disordered breathing,"" a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. About 10 percent of elementary-school-age children snore.\n\nDoctors say snoring can cause bed-wetting, behavior problems, short stature and poor school performance. That\'s a far cry from the 1950s and \'60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats.\n\nBack then, it was the most popular surgery in the United States. In the 1960s sitcom Leave It to Beaver, Beaver Cleaver was so impressed by his dad\'s tales of ice cream and pretty nurses that he schemed to have his tonsils out, even though he didn\'t need it.\n\nTurning Point For Tonsillectomies\n\nIt was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections. People were growing up with their tonsils.\n\nThe tonsils are two glands that sit at the base of the tongue and are part of the body\'s immune system. The premise of tonsillectomies, back in their heyday, was that tonsils get infected themselves and no longer help fend off germs.\n\nThen doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn\'t until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections.\n\n""It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections,"" says Richard Rosenfeld, an ear, nose and throat doctor at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, N.Y. ""People were growing up with their tonsils.""\n\nBut growing up with tonsils can create another problem: snoring. Lisa Moran of Takoma Park, Md., remembers what it sounded like when her son ,Tyler Scorza, now age 7, slept.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR Maggie Starbard/NPR\n\n""It was loud,"" Moran says. ""You could hear him through he closed door, down the hall, snoring, and he would occasionally stop breathing.""\n\nAt first, Tyler\'s pediatrician thought he\'d outgrow the snoring. But he wasn\'t sleeping well and often didn\'t have any energy. The doctor recommended a head X-Ray, and the radiologist said that though Tyler\'s adenoids were enlarged, they weren\'t that bad.\n\nBy then, Tyler had been dealing with this for almost three years. He started getting frequent nasal infections. So his parents took him to an ear, nose and throat doctor. He said, sure, the adenoids are swollen.\n\n""But the real problem is the tonsils!"" Moran recalls. ""He showed us on the X-ray that there was a tiny passage between the tonsils and the back of his throat — very small.""\n\nEnlarged tonsils (and adenoids) are the most common cause of sleep-disordered breathing in children. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy.\n\nComplications From Surgery\n\nBut Tyler\'s parents were worried about the surgery. It\'s usually done as an outpatient procedure now, but with general anesthesia. That\'s never without some risk.\n\n""Your child is under,"" says Moran, ""completely under. This is not a local.""\n\nOther complications include pain after surgery and the risk of bleeding; about 4 percent of people have complications that require readmission to the hospital.\n\nDespite hundreds of studies, there\'s still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial.\n\nWhat\'s A Sleep Study? Sleep studies are a way for doctors to diagnose sleep disorders like apnea by observing patients overnight while they sleep. During a sleep study, the patient is connected to an array of sensors monitoring brainwaves, eye movements, heart rate, breathing and blood-oxygen levels. This information, called a polysomnogram, lets doctors see whether the patient has stopped breathing and for how long. Apnea in adults happens when 10 seconds pass without breathing; for children, it\'s a disruption of two cycles of inhaling and exhaling. Some patients can also use portable sleep monitors to record what\'s happening in their sleep as an alternative to the sleep study, but that approach is not as comprehensive. Many sleep disorders can be diagnosed without costly sleep studies, which can run anywhere from $600 to several-thousand dollars. More children are undergoing sleep studies as awareness of the condition — particularly in children — rises. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine says about 2 percent of children have obstructive sleep apnea. Before a sleep study is ordered, doctors typically ask for medical and sleep histories and a physical exam. — Eliza Barclay\n\nNo less a personage than President Obama dissed tonsillectomy when he was stumping for health care overhaul in July 2009. In a prime time news conference, Obama said that doctors may think: "" \'You know what? I make a lot more money if I take this kid\'s tonsils out.\' ""\n\nRosenfeld disputes Obama\'s claim, saying insurers usually pay a surgeon $200 to $300 for tonsil surgery.\n\nSleep Study Before Tonsillectomy\n\nThe picture is further clouded because not all children with big tonsils have sleep-disordered breathing or frequent throat infections. Because of that, in 2002 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered.\n\nAbout 530,000 tonsillectomies are performed in the United States each year. Obviously, parents could use some help in deciding whether surgery is needed. In January, the American Academy of Otolaryngology issued its first guidelines on tonsillectomy in children.\n\nWith sore throats, the ENTs recommend waiting (and treatment with antibiotics, if needed), unless a child has more than seven infections in a year. They\'d recommend surgery if a child has five or more throat infections a year for two years, or three or more in three years.\n\nThere have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Most of the researchers have asked parents or children whether they noticed improvements, and looked at a single measure, like behavior or quality of life. Still, the ENTs recommend tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing, saying it reduces symptoms in most children.\n\nTyler\'s family decided to go ahead with the surgery; they went to the hospital at 5 a.m., and Tyler was home by noon. The doctors said he would be out of school for a week, but a throat infection kept him home a second week. His classmates sent him get-well cards.\n\nA year later, Tyler is feeling great. And his snoring is gone. ""Completely gone,"" his mom says. ""You can hear a pin-drop quiet when he sleeps.""\n\nTyler still hears snoring at night, he says. But he knows that the culprit is not him, or the family dog. It\'s Dad.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A well-written story on the interesting history of tonsil problems and changing attitudes about surgeries.  But the story does not back up the headline, which says definitively that “Tonsillectomy helps kids sleep.”</span>","The evidence is really weak on the claim made in the headline, as the story later acknowledges. We wish the story had spent a little more time on costs and quantifying benefits instead of paying so much attention to one anecdotal case where a surgery was done to alleviate snoring.
The health care system needs to continue to be critical of interventions that don’t work or are harmful.  It’s clear that we haven’t had good evidence for much of how this old procedure has been done.

It began its work within hours and a single dose lasted about a week, Northwestern University researchers reported.\n\n""We saw a robust, rapid-acting, long-lasting effect,"" said lead researcher Joseph Moskal, a research professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern\'s McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and director of the school\'s Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics. ""In addition, we have shown little or no side effects with our compound.""\n\nOne expert said the drug might prove a valuable tool against depression.\n\n""It sounds like an exciting development,"" Dr. Bryan Bruno, acting chair of psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said. If it were a pill, the drug could change treatment for many patients, he added. ""Because it\'s so quick it would be a huge advantage over our current medications all of which take six to eight weeks for the full effect and at least three to four weeks to start working for most people,"" Bruno said.\n\nCurrently, the most popular drugs to treat depression are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These include Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro. They work by improving levels of the hormone serotonin, which may be too low in people suffering from depression.\n\nAlthough SSRIs are effective in many people, not all respond to the same drugs and some people don\'t respond well.\n\nGLYX-13, the new drug, is still being studied and it isn\'t projected to be available before some time in 2016, Moskal said. Many unknowns remain about the drug, including its long-term effects, whether some people won\'t respond to it and the effects of stopping its use.\n\nMoskal, however, said he is confident that this drug will be a breakthrough in treating depression. Given the results so far, he said, people won\'t need to take the drug every day, only once a week or less.\n\nThe GLYX-13 study is a phase 2 trial, which evaluates a drug\'s effectiveness while continuing to assess its safety.\n\nThe results were presented Thursday at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology annual meeting in Hollywood, Fla. Findings from the team\'s animal research that led to the new method appeared online Dec. 3 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\nMoskal is the founder and chief scientific officer of the biotechnology firm Naurex Inc., which conducted the study. Northwestern University has licensed the intellectual property rights to certain therapeutics developed by Moskal to Naurex, according to a Northwestern news release.\n\nThe study received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health among others.\n\nGLYX-13 targets parts of the brain linked to learning and memory. An advantage is that the drug doesn\'t have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted.\n\nMoskal\'s team developed a new way to target the brain\'s NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor to achieve these results. The clinical trial included about 120 patients, Moskal said. Patients were either given the drug or an inactive placebo.\n\nAntidepressant effects of the drug were seen within 24 hours and lasted an average of seven days. The effect of the drug was substantially better than seen with other antidepressants, the researchers found. The drug was so well received by patients that many who were in the trial have called asking to be in any further trials, Moskal said.\n\nA new trial that makes use of the drug in pill form is slated to get under way next year, Moskal noted.\n\nBecause the drug targets these areas of the brain it might also help people with other problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and Alzheimer\'s disease, the researchers suggested.\n\nFor his part, Bruno cautioned that the long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice.\n\nFindings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about depression, visit the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.']","This story does some things quite well, but still gets unsatisfactory scores on some of what we consider to be key criteria.","The story does a great job in highlighting a potential conflict of interest and also in cautioning that data presented at scientific meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nThe Ache: In cold and flu season, pathogens spread when people are crammed into close quarters, such as airplanes and cars.\n\nThe Claim: Personal air purifiers worn around the neck clean the air in the wearer’s breathing zone of viruses and bacteria as well as allergens, say companies that sell them.\n\nThe Verdict: The devices helped clear a variety of test particles from the air in lab tests, but scientists say there’s no proof they have any health benefit in real conditions.\n\n“It sounds like it worked in a laboratory setting, but that doesn’t say anything about whether it works in real life,” says Darryl C. Zeldin, scientific director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. Theoretically it is possible that the devices might help reduce transmission of pathogens, or ease asthma symptoms, but proof is needed, he adds.\n\nPersonal air purifiers work by emitting electrically charged molecules or atoms called ions, companies say. The ions transfer the charge to particles—such as one carrying a flu virus—in the user’s breathing zone and since like-charged particles repel each other, they are pushed out of the breathing zone, companies say.\n\nThe AirSupply Minimate from Wein Products Inc. in Los Angeles, emits positive ions and fits in the palm of the hand. The AirTamer A310, new last year from Headwaters Inc. in Marblehead, Mass., emits negative ions. It recharges through a USB port and holds the charge for 150 hours of continuous use, says company co-founder Troy Anderson. Both devices have suggested prices of $150.\n\nIn lab tests funded by Headwaters, the AirTamer was found to efficiently clear cigarette smoke, Mr. Anderson says.\n\nIn research partly funded by the company, Wein’s technology has undergone a battery of testing by University of Cincinnati scientists. In a study, published in the journal Indoor Air in 2005, a prototype of the Minimate was tested for removal of particles, including salt particles in a variety of sizes and a bacterium that doesn’t usually cause disease. It cleared the air of half of the test particles after 15 minutes, and nearly all of them within 90 minutes, according to the results.\n\nThe particles remain present on surfaces, “but at least you reduce inhalation exposure,” says study author Sergey A. Grinshpun, a professor of environmental health at the university. Since the particles used in the test were similar to the size of bacteria and particles carrying infectious viruses, it wasn’t necessary to use infectious particles in the test, he adds.\n\nDr. Grinshpun’s study appears nicely done, but doesn’t reflect real-life conditions, says Werner E. Bischoff, an infectious-disease specialist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. In the lab tests, the particles are introduced only once and the purifier is given time to clear them, he adds, but “if you sit next to a person in an airplane, this person will sneeze and cough during the entire eight-hour flight.”\n\nENLARGE AirSupply Minimate emits positive ions and fits in the palm of the hand.

It’s always a good idea to avoid touching your nose or mouth after touching the back of an airline seat.\n\nThe Cincinnati researchers also found the Minimate prototype reduced the concentration of “viable” airborne bacteria, defined as bacteria that grow well on a petri dish, Dr. Grinshpun says. It isn’t known exactly what causes the inactivation of bacteria, he says.\n\nHeadwaters’s Mr. Anderson and Stanley Weinberg, CEO and chairman of Wein, both say that while it’s difficult to test the devices for real-world benefits, customer feedback has been positive.\n\nScientists caution that the antibacterial effect could be caused by a gaseous byproduct of the device, such as ozone, an air pollutant. Both Messrs. Anderson and Weinberg say their devices produce negligible amounts of ozone. Mr. Weinberg adds that the Minimate has also tested negative for hydrogen-peroxide emission.\n\nIn 2006, a personal air purifier exploded on a Continental Airlines flight, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. According to the report, the problem was probably caused by the user recharging a non-rechargeable battery; there were no serious injuries. The device, called the Fresh Air Buddy and formerly manufactured by Wein for another company, is no longer made, says Mr. Weinberg.\n\nWhether you’re allowed to take an air purifier on an airplane depends on the carrier. United Airlines, which now owns Continental, doesn’t allow the air purifiers in the cabin based on the results of an “internal review,” a spokeswoman says.

Newly postmenopausal women who received estrogen via a skin patch had reduced beta-amyloid deposits, the sticky plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, a Mayo Clinic study published this month in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease found. Ultimately, these deposits harm neurons, leading to cognitive problems.\n\nIn the study, women with APOE e4 — one form of the most common gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease — had lower levels of amyloid deposits.\n\n“This study showed, for the first time, that the brain amyloid deposition ─ a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease ─ is reduced in newly postmenopausal women who received 17beta-Estradiol patch form of hormone therapy,” says lead author Kejal Kantarci, M.D., a Mayo Clinic radiologist. “Women with APOE e4, who have a greater genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, particularly benefited from this therapy.”\n\nMEDIA CONTACT: Susan Barber Lindquist, Mayo Clinic Public Affairs, 507-284-5005, newsbureau@mayo.edu\n\nMenopause is defined as occurring 12 months after a woman’s last menstrual period and marks the end of menstrual cycles. In the U.S., the average age of menopause is 51. A rapid decline in estrogen with menopause may be associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease risk in women.\n\nThe Women’s Health Initiative study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that menopausal hormone therapy started in women 65 or older increased the risk of dementia. In contrast, the multicenter Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study tested the hypothesis that healthy and younger women would respond to menopausal hormone therapy more favorably.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic study used data from the Kronos study to determine the effects of menopausal hormone therapy shortly after menopause, during the critical window of rapid estrogen depletion — five to 36 months past menopause. Researchers investigated the brain amyloid deposition in 68 women ages 42 to 59 who participated in the Kronos trial during this critical window. The researchers used positron emission tomography, also known as a PET scan, to look for the brain amyloid deposits three years after the trial ended.\n\nOf the 68 women, 21 received estrogen via a skin patch, 17 received estrogen orally and 30 received a placebo. Amyloid deposition was lower in women who received the patch, compared to the placebo, and the effect was most apparent in women with the APOE e4 genotype. The oral treatment was not associated with lower amyloid deposition.\n\nThe authors are seeking funding to perform amyloid PET imaging at eight more Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention study sites around the U.S.\n\n“If our results are confirmed in the larger group of women, this finding has the potential to change the concepts for preventive interventions that drive the Alzheimer’s disease field today,” Dr. Kantarci says. “It also may have a significant impact on women making the decision to use hormone therapy in the early postmenopausal years.”\n\nStudy co-authors are Val Lowe, M.D.; Timothy Lesnick, M.S.; Nirubol Tosakulwong; Kent Bailey, Ph.D.; Julie Fields, Ph.D.; Lynne Shuster, M.D.; Samantha Zuk; Matthew Senjem M.S.; Michelle Mielke, Ph.D.; Clifford Jack Jr., M.D.; Walter Rocca, M.D.; and Virginia Miller, Ph.D., all of Mayo Clinic; and Carey Gleason, Ph.D., of University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.\n\nThis study is funded by the Aurora Foundation to the Kronos Longevity Research Institute and NIH.

The study was carefully done, and the news release offers some useful details about the study’s methods. However, the study included just 68 women, too few to make the patterns found reliable. To its credit, the release quotes the lead author about the need for larger replications. But that begs the question of why the Mayo Clinic seeks to publicize this work at all, particularly with a news release headline that emphasizes disease reduction potential, when the study only looked at amyloid levels, a risk marker. There is very active debate as to whether lowering amyloid will have any impact on actual symptoms or rates of Alzheimer’s disease. A better headline might have been: “Pilot Study Suggests Estrogen Patch in Newly Postmenopausal Women Reduces Amyloid, Marker of Alzheimer’s Risk.” Journalists certainly deserve to know about this study, but they need to keep it in their back pockets until more rigorous clinical studies have been done.

It makes an emotional pitch for the value of CPR by non-medical personnel, and leaves readers with the clear implication that CPR is an emergency measure with a proven, high success rate, even in the hands of amateurs. And therein is the problem. CPR does save lives, but at a rate many experts acknowledge is astonishingly low, even when performed by EMTs, physicians, and nurses in hospital settings. It’s hard to fault a story that may prompt  “civilians” to get potentially life-saving CPR training, but readers would have been much better served to also hear about the substantial downsides to CPR,  urgent need for public support of further CPR research, and alternatives to current CPR resuscitation efforts, such as the out-of-hospital use of automated external defibrillators, also known as AEDs.

There were no complete responses with Yervoy alone.\n\n“The response rates and the depth of responses are quite impressive,” Dr. Stephen Hodi, director of the Melanoma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and co-lead author of the study, said in an interview.\n\nThe median time it took for Yervoy patients to see their cancer worsen was 4.4 months. But after 11 months, more than half of the combination group had yet to see their disease worsen. Overall survival data was not yet available.\n\n“Longer follow-up will be helpful to see the durability of these responses and what happens to patients who had complete responses,” said Hodi, who presented data from the Checkpoint-069 study at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nYervoy, also known as ipilimumab, had been the first immunotherapy to extend survival in patients with advanced melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer. It works by taking the brakes off the immune system to more efficiently attack cancer. Opdivo (nivolumab) belongs to a promising new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system.\n\nIn a separate group of 33 patients with a mutation of the BRAF gene involved in cancer cell growth, the overall response rate was 52 percent for the combination. The complete response rate was 22 percent. That compared with 1 percent overall response rate and no complete responses for Yervoy alone.\n\nThe combination of the two drugs also led to far higher levels of side effects, such as colitis and inflammation of lung tissue, at 54 percent versus 24 percent for Yervoy alone. Patients were also more likely to stop taking the combination of drugs.\n\n“Most of the patients who stopped for toxicity continued to benefit,” said Fouad Namouni, Bristol’s head of development for Yervoy and Opdivo.']",This bare-bones report on a drug trial was probably aimed at investors — but will almost certainly reach consumers as well.

It’s exciting and interesting news, but the story does little more than scratch the surface of this topic. It does not adequately address study design, cost or potential harms, and does not include any independent, third-party input.

All of the trials reviewed had ""major limitations,"" such as having too few patients, relying on parental reports of symptoms, or the study design (such as not being double-blinded).\n\n""The notion that any form of complementary and alternative medicine is effective for infantile colic currently is not supported from the evidence from the included randomized clinical trials,"" the researchers from the United Kingdom wrote. ""Additional replications are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.""\n\nBut because fennel extract, certain herbal teas and sugar water are generally safe, and because the research does suggest babies may benefit, pediatricians said they would feel comfortable recommending them to parents.\n\n""It\'s reasonable for parents to consider those kinds of interventions for which there is some suggestion of benefit but no known risks,"" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children\'s Medical Center of New York.\n\nThe study, published in the April print issue of Pediatrics, appears online March 28.\n\nColic usually starts when a baby is about three weeks old, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and author of the Expecting 411 book series. Colic is usually defined as excessive and inconsolable crying for at least three hours a day for more than three days a week over more than three weeks.\n\n""It\'s miserable for both baby and the parents,"" Brown said. ""And although we\'ve been studying it for years, no one has figured out what the cause is, which makes it all the more difficult to treat.""\n\nIn the United States, between 5 and 19 percent of infants are estimated to have colic, according to background information in the article.\n\nBecause pediatricians can\'t offer parents much help with it -- for the most part, babies grow out of colic in time -- desperate parents often turn to alternative or complementary treatments, according to the study.\n\nIn the review, the study authors searched various databases of medical research and chose 15 randomized clinical trials involving alternative treatments for colic. The studies were published between 1991 and 2008, came from 10 different countries and included a total of 944 children.\n\nSeveral studies looked at spinal manipulation by a chiropractor. In three of those studies, parents reported their children cried significantly less afterwards. But those studies were small and flawed, so no conclusions can be made about the technique, according to the new review.\n\nThree studies looked at herbal supplements. One found improvement in infants given fennel extract compared to infants given a placebo; another found that infants given a tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel and balm-mint seemed to work; while a third found infants given a tea containing fennel, lemon balm and chamomile cried less than infants given a placebo.\n\nFennel, an intestinal ""antispasmodic,"" may increase the speed at which food moves through the intestine, Brown said. This may help if the underlying cause of colic is cramping or discomfort due to an immature digestive tract, although that is just a theory, Brown added.\n\nTwo studies looked at giving babies solutions of sugar water, which some researchers believe has pain-killing properties. The parents of babies given sugar water reported significantly less crying. (If parents want to try it, they could deliver sugar water in a dropper, or put a small amount in a bottle, Adesman said.)\n\nA study of probiotics, which are reputed to help digestion, found that 95 percent of infants given L. reuteria probiotics seemed to reduce their average crying time compared to 7 percent of babies given simethicone, which is marketed to relieve gas under the brand names Mylicon and PediaCare Infants\' Gas Relief.\n\n""This is pertinent given that simethicone is considered the best available and most commonly prescribed treatment for colic, although it previously has been shown to be no more effective than the placebo,"" according to the authors.\n\nBrown said the strength of that finding suggests L. reuteria is worth further study.\n\nOne study found no difference in improvement of symptoms between infants whose parents were taught to do infant massage compared to infants put in a crib that vibrated. Nor did soy-enriched formula seem to help.\n\nA small study of babies given reflexology showed some improvement, but there was no difference in whether the reflexology targeted the feet, which are considered to be therapeutic for colic, or other parts of the body.\n\nThis implies the improvement may ""have more to do with the therapeutic effect of touch than the actual therapy itself,"" Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the department of complementary medicine at Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, in the United Kingdom, and colleagues wrote in the report.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Nemours Foundation has more on colic.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">We found a stunning contrast between this story and another on the same study reported on the <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3767"" target=""_blank"">MSNBC site’s “Today Moms” feature</a>. We had to double check to make sure they were talking about the same study.</span>","HealthDay breaks down the evidence in a clear, concise way for readers, emphasizing high in the story that there still is not much evidence that any form of therapy works to quell colic. We wish it had spent a little more time quantifying the benefits that were found in this review for different alternative therapies, and we would have liked to have seen some cost information. All in all, though, this is exactly the approach more stories should take instead of presenting parents with an ever changing set of options for treating childhood maladies, none of which have much support in the scientific literature.

Thirteen of the women taking the drug for an additional five years developed breast cancer in the opposite breast during the study, compared with 31 taking the placebo; 55 and 68, respectively, developed a recurrence of cancer in the original breast.\n\nFor any individual woman, the odds of developing “contralateral” breast cancer — that is, in the opposite breast — are still lower than 200-to-1 per year.\n\nadvertisement\n\nStill, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, who serves as the chief medical officer of ASCO and who was not involved in the study, “there’s a substantial benefit” to continuing aromatase inhibitors out to 10 years to lower the chance of cancer developing in the other breast.\n\nThe study did not continue long enough to discover whether the lower risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast translated into a lower risk of death.\n\nThe study, which was also published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, was partially funded by Novartis (NVS), which sells letrozole — the aromatase inhibitor used in the trial — as the branded drug Femara. Several of the authors have received speaking fees or consulting payments from Novartis, AstraZeneca (AZN) (which makes letrozole), and Pfizer (PFE) (maker of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane).\n\nLetrozole is available as a generic for less than $100 a month.\n\nThe trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what’s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. About two-thirds of breast cancers are hormone-receptor positive, and they have a good prognosis. Aromatase inhibitors block an enzyme that the body needs to produce estrogen.\n\nThe women had taken another breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, for several years and then were started on an aromatase inhibitor, which doctors usually prescribe for five years.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nAfter following the women for a median of just over six years, found Dr. Paul Goss of Massachusetts General Hospital and his colleagues, 95 percent of those taking letrozole for the additional five years remained free of breast cancer (meaning the disease had not returned in the original breast or developed in the opposite one). Of those taking an inert pill, or placebo, 91 percent did.\n\nPut another way, the risk of cancer returning in the original or the opposite breast was 34 percent lower in women on 10 years of letrozole compared with those who stopped after five. There was no difference in survival, however: 100 women in each group died during the study.\n\n“The reason this is a milestone trial is that it’s the first to show that 10 years [on letrozole] is better than five,” said Dr. Nicholas Robert, an oncologist with Virginia Cancer Specialists and a co-author of the study. But because the absolute benefits were not huge, and because the drug did cause side effects, it makes sense to consider this for women at the highest risk of a recurrence of breast cancer, he said.\n\nAromatase inhibitors cause side effects in some women, especially night sweats, hot flashes, and sexual dysfunction. Women receiving five more years of letrozole also had greater loss of bone in their hip, worse osteoporosis, and more fractures.\n\nExperts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. There had been no research on whether that was beneficial.\n\nDr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) “substantial. If you can tolerate the side effects, I think many women will opt to take the extra years of letrozole, so this study is practice-changing.”\n\nDr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society cautioned, however, that “one has to be cautious in interpreting these results,” partly because “based on what they show, there is no overall change in survival.”""]","This story hit all the important marks for reporting on a medical story. A solid, strong effort.","This is a story about a new study on whether extending the use of letrozole (brand name Femara), a type of drug known as an aromatase inhibitor, reduces recurrence in breast cancer survivors.
Women who have undergone treatment for hormone-receptor positive breast cancer typically take aromatase inhibitors for the subsequent five years. The study showed that extending this treatment to 10 years lowers the rate of recurrence. The added benefit of continuing aromatase inhibitors for 10 years as opposed to five must, however, be weighed against the side effects. For women who are at high risk of recurrence, the results of this study are of particular interest.
The story does a commendable job of presenting a clear and balanced report of the study findings, and by stating that the results did not find a difference in overall survival.

While their high blood pressure was not affected, cardiac health improved.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a major contributor to a form of heart failure that affects the way heart relaxes between contractions. About half of the human patients with heart failure suffer from this particular condition, known as diastolic heart failure. The majority of those patients are elderly women with high blood pressure. Importantly, there are currently no effective treatments for diastolic heart failure.\n\n""This low dose of thyroid hormone safely restored depressed cardiac tissue T3 levels to normal while largely preventing the accumulation of collagen, or scar tissue, resulting from sustained high blood pressure,"" said Gerdes. ""Thus, T3 treatment inhibited the major cause of stiffening of the heart in hypertension. The rats experienced overall improvement in contractile proteins and heart function too.""\n\nGerdes has published 32 animal studies showing a link between improvements in thyroid hormone levels and heart health in rats and mice.\n\n""The challenge now is to determine if humans benefit the same way,"" said Gerdes. ""If we can improve heart disease outcomes in patients by restoring normal thyroid function in the heart, we could save lives along with billions of dollars in health care expenses.""\n\nIn 2014, a study in Molecular Medicine showed that administering low doses of a thyroid hormone to rats with diabetes helped restore hormone levels in their hearts and prevented deterioration of heart function, adverse gene changes, and pathology. Earlier, a study in the Journal of Cardiac Failure found that thyroid hormone replacement therapy in rats significantly reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation. A 2013 study in The Journal of Translational Medicine showed thyroid hormone treatment administered to rats at the time of a heart attack led to a significant reduction in the loss of heart muscle cells and improvement in heart function.\n\nGerdes has long argued that medical opinion on thyroid treatment for patients with heart disease is largely shaped by outdated studies that used toxic doses of thyroid hormones.\n\n""What we have tried to do here is show the effect of safe doses of thyroid hormones and we\'re seeing amazing results in multiple studies, with dramatic improvements in heart function, gene expression, and collagen levels, just by restoring depressed thyroid levels in the heart,"" said Gerdes. ""The studies demonstrate that we should be able to implement a similar, safe treatment and monitoring program for use in human clinical trials. The experts once warned that Beta blockers were too dangerous to use in heart failure patients. But, they were proven to be wrong and these life-saving drugs are now standard therapy for heart failure treatment.

That number has risen in recent years, but it’s unclear whether that’s due to more kids with symptoms or doctors who are more likely to recognize and diagnose autism.\n\nThe new study, which appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association, doesn’t prove low folic acid in pregnant women causes their babies to develop autism, or that high doses can prevent it. And Suren and his colleagues didn’t see an effect of folic acid on other autism spectrum disorders, such as Asperger’s.\n\nThey followed just over 85,000 women and their children, born between 2002 and 2008.\n\nWhen women were about halfway through their pregnancies, they reported on any supplements or vitamins they’d taken in the few weeks before becoming pregnant and the two months afterward - the time when folic acid is thought to have the strongest effect on development.\n\nBy the time their kids were between three and 10 years old, 270 had been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, including 114 with autism itself.\n\nSuren’s team found one in 1,000 babies born to women who reported taking folic acid early in pregnancy had autism, compared to about two in 1,000 of those whose moms didn’t take folic acid. On the other hand, there was no link between fish oil taken during pregnancy and autism risk.\n\nThat suggests it’s something about folic acid, in particular, that influences a baby’s autism risk.\n\n“The biggest problem we have is, how do you know it’s folic acid and not just a more health-conscious mother?” said Cathrine Hoyo, who has studied folic acid supplementation at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n“Doing that (analysis) really added another layer toward convincing us that there is something to it,” Hoyo, who wasn’t involved in the new research, told Reuters Health.\n\nBEFORE PREGNANCY, TOO\n\nResearchers said folic acid’s effects on genes and DNA repair could explain its role in brain development disorders in growing babies, including autism.\n\nThe USPSTF recommends all women who are planning to or could become pregnant take between 400 and 800 micrograms of the vitamin daily. The U.S. and Canada have also required flour to be fortified with folic acid since the late 1990s to cut down on birth defect risks.\n\nStill, “The message for folic acid before pregnancy has been a little bit lost,” said Rebecca Schmidt, who has studied prenatal vitamins and autism at the University of California, Davis.\n\n“If you are not even just planning a pregnancy, but able to get pregnant, then you should be taking some sort of folic acid supplement,” she told Reuters Health.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/JjFzqx Journal of the American Medical Association, online February 12, 2013.']",This story about possible links between folic acid supplements and reduced autism risk tries to include enough caveats to put the study results in the proper perspective. Compared to an ,"The body of this story clearly makes the point that these researchers went to great lengths to rule out alternative explanations for the data showing that Norwegian women who took folic acid supplements before or early in pregnancy were less likely to have a child later diagnosed with autism.

He reviewed the findings for WebMD.\n\nStandard vs. Laser Cataract Surgery\n\nMore than 1.5 million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. One in three mostly older Americans will have the surgery at some point in their lives.\n\nThe surgery is performed to remove the natural lens of the eye after it has become clouded over time. A permanent artificial lens is then implanted to replace the natural lens and provide appropriate vision correction for each patient.\n\nCurrently, most aspects of cataract surgery, including the initial incision and the breakup and removal of the clouded lens from the lens capsule, are performed manually by the surgeon. An ultrasound instrument with a vibrating needle is used to break up the cataracts, and a vacuum sucks them out.\n\nThe new studies looked at using the so-called femtosecond laser to deliver near-infrared light to fragment the cataract into tiny segments prior to removal.\n\n""The idea is that all the surgeon will have to do is remove the pieces with a vacuum,"" says researcher Mark Packer, MD, of Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland. ""Ideally, you won\'t need ultrasound, or at least you\'ll need less ultrasound.""\n\nThat\'s important because ultrasound can cause collateral damage to the eye, he says.

It was the story’s job to point out that these views might not represent a totally objective evaluation of the evidence.

Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n“Taking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,” she said in a telephone interview.\n\nPoor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\nTo investigate, Zheng’s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year.\n\nOver the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person’s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.\n\nWhile the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn’t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.\n\nShe recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.\n\n“This study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,” said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the research.\n\n“If you’re aging without good vision, not only are you giving your brain less stimulation, you might be altering your brain at a structural level,” she said in a phone interview.\n\nThe good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable. Even incurable causes of age-related vision loss such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration “are highly treatable, so we can reduce the amount of vision loss that people suffer from if they’re detected early.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2KNE36Y and bit.ly/2KKPqfN JAMA Ophthalmology, online June 28, 2018.']",How strong is the link between vision and cognition?  The story doesn’t say.,"Scientists have established a relationship between clearness of vision and cognitive function in older individuals; they seem to rise or fall together.  But does one cause the other?  In an attempt to answer that question, a trio of researchers introduced time into the analysis, exploring the relationship between clarity of vision at time 1 and cognitive function at time 2, and vice versa, repeatedly over an 8-year period.  The study does find a relationship but, given the large number of participants in the study (more than 2500), it is a modest one.  Alas, that does not deter either sources in the story or the headline writer, who opt into causal statements that are far stronger than the data warrant.

Now, two studies suggest that there is merit to that strategy.\n\nThe studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , compared opioid prescription patterns in states that have enacted medical cannabis laws with those that have not. One of the studies looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D between 2010 and 2015, while the other looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid between 2011 and 2016.\n\nThe researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had 2.21 million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under Medicare Part D, compared with those states without medical cannabis laws. Opioid prescriptions under Medicaid also dropped by 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws, according to the studies.\n\n""This study adds one more brick in the wall in the argument that cannabis clearly has medical applications,"" said David Bradford , professor of public administration and policy at the University of Georgia and a lead author of the Medicare study.\n\n""And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective.""\n\nMedicare Part D, the optional prescription drug benefit plan for those enrolled in Medicare, covers more than 42 million Americans, including those 65 or older. Medicaid provides health coverage to more than 73 million low-income individuals in the US, according to the program\'s website\n\n""Medicare and Medicaid publishes this data, and we\'re free to use it, and anyone who\'s interested can download the data,"" Bradford said. ""But that means that we don\'t know what\'s going on with the privately insured and the uninsured population, and for that, I\'m afraid the data sets are proprietary and expensive.""\n\n\'This crisis is very real\'\n\nThe new research comes as the United States remains entangled in the worst opioid epidemic the world has ever seen. Opioid overdose has risen dramatically over the past 15 years and has been implicated in over 500,000 deaths since 2000 -- more than the number of Americans killed in World War II\n\n""As somebody who treats patients with opioid use disorders, this crisis is very real. These patients die every day, and it\'s quite shocking in many ways,"" said Dr. Kevin Hill , an addiction psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\n""We have had overuse of certain prescription opioids over the years, and it\'s certainly contributed to the opioid crisis that we\'re feeling,"" he added. ""I don\'t think that\'s the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids.""\n\nLike opioids, marijuana has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain as well as other conditions such as seizures, multiple sclerosis and certain mental disorders, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse . Research suggests that the cannabinoid and opioid receptor systems rely on common signaling pathways in the brain, including the dopamine reward system that is central to drug tolerance, dependence and addiction.\n\n""All drugs of abuse operate using some shared pathways. For example, cannabinoid receptors and opioid receptors coincidentally happen to be located very close by in many places in the brain,"" Hill said. ""So it stands to reason that a medication that affects one system might affect the other.""\n\nBut unlike opioids, marijuana has little addiction potential, and virtually no deaths from marijuana overdose have been reported in the United States, according to Bradford.\n\n""No one has ever died of cannabis, so it has many safety advantages over opiates,"" Bradford said. ""And to the extent that we\'re trying to manage the opiate crisis, cannabis is a potential tool.""\n\nComparing states with and without medical marijuana laws\n\nIn order to evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids, the two teams of researchers looked at whether opioid prescriptions were lower in states that had active medical cannabis laws and whether those states that enacted these laws during the study period saw reductions in opioid prescriptions.\n\nBoth teams, in fact, did find that opioid prescriptions were significantly lower in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws. The team that looked at Medicaid patients also found that the four states that switched from medical use only to recreational use -- Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington -- saw further reductions in opioid prescriptions, according to Hefei Wen , assistant professor of health management and policy at the University of Kentucky and a lead author on the Medicaid study.\n\n""We saw a 9% or 10% reduction (in opioid prescriptions) in Colorado and Oregon,"" Wen said. ""And in Alaska and Washington, the magnitude was a little bit smaller but still significant.""\n\nThe first state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medicinal use was California, in 1996. Since then, 29 states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of legalized cannabis. All of these states include chronic pain -- either directly or indirectly -- in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use, according to Bradford.\n\nThe details of the medical cannabis laws were found to have a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns, the researchers found. States that permitted recreational use, for example, saw an additional 6.38% reduction in opioid prescriptions under Medicaid compared with those states that permitted marijuana only for medical use, according to Wen.\n\nThe method of procurement also had a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns. States that permitted medical dispensaries -- regulated shops that people can visit to purchase cannabis products -- had 3.742 million fewer opioid prescriptions filled per year under Medicare Part D, while those that allowed only home cultivation had 1.792 million fewer opioid prescriptions per year.\n\n""We found that there was about a 14.5% reduction in any opiate use when dispensaries were turned on -- and that was statistically significant -- and about a 7% reduction in any opiate use when home cultivation only was turned on,"" Bradford said. ""So dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates.""\n\nThe impact of these laws also differed based on the class of opioid prescribed. Specifically, states with medical cannabis laws saw 20.7% fewer morphine prescriptions and 17.4% fewer hydrocodone prescriptions compared with states that did not have these laws, according to Bradford.\n\nFentanyl prescriptions under Medicare Part D also dropped by 8.5% in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws, though the difference was not statistically significant, Bradford said. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, like heroin, that can be prescribed legally by physicians. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and even a small amount can be fatal, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse\n\n""I know that many people, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, are skeptical of cannabis,"" Bradford said. ""But, you know, the attorney general needs to be terrified of fentanyl.""\n\n\'A call to action\'\n\nThis is not the first time researchers have found a link between marijuana legalization and decreased opioid use. A 2014 study showed that states with medical cannabis laws had 24.8% fewer opioid overdose deaths between 1999 and 2010. A study in 2017 also found that the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado in 2012 reversed the state\'s upward trend in opioid-related deaths.\n\n""There is a growing body of scientific literature suggesting that legal access to marijuana can reduce the use of opioids as well as opioid-related overdose deaths,"" said Melissa Moore , New York deputy state director for the Drug Policy Alliance. ""In states with medical marijuana laws, we have already seen decreased admissions for opioid-related treatment and dramatically reduced rates of opioid overdoses.""\n\nSome skeptics, though, argue that marijuana legalization could actually worsen the opioid epidemic. Another 2017 study , for example, showed a positive association between illicit cannabis use and opioid use disorders in the United States. But there may be an important difference between illicit cannabis use and legalized cannabis use, according to Hill.\n\n""As we have all of these states implementing these policies, it\'s imperative that we do more research,"" Hill said. ""We need to study the effects of these policies, and we really haven\'t done it to the degree that we should.""\n\nThe two recent studies looked only at patients enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare Part D, meaning the results may not be generalizable to the entire US population.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBut both Hill and Moore agree that as more states debate the merits of legalizing marijuana in the coming months and years, more research will be needed to create consistency between cannabis science and cannabis policy.\n\n""There is a great deal of movement in the Northeast, with New Hampshire and New Jersey being well-positioned to legalize adult use,"" Moore said. ""I believe there are also ballot measures to legalize marijuana in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota as well that voters will decide on in Fall 2018.""\n\nHill called the new research ""a call to action"" and added, ""we should be studying these policies. But unfortunately, the policies have far outpaced the science at this point.""']",There was no way to know if anyone was actually choosing to use marijuana instead of opioids.,"Health professionals—from doctors to policy experts—are exploring strategies for controlling the opioid crisis gripping the U.S. Advocates for legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational purposes have suggested that increased access to marijuana could curb opioid use. The two studies published in JAMA Internal Medicine discussed in this CNN article found that state legalization of medical marijuana was associated with a decrease in opioid prescriptions.
But before it presented the data, the article led readers to believe the study findings “suggest that there is merit” in “using medical marijuana to help Americans struggling with opioid addiction,”—which is beyond what the studies could possibly show.
The article took another misstep when it stated that the researchers analyzed opioid prescriptions to “evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids.” The data the researchers looked at could not answer that question. These were not clinical trials comparing pain relief from marijuana with pain relief from opioids in patients who would typically be prescribed opioids. They were analyses of data on opioid prescriptions in Medicaid and Medicare databases.
The researchers detail the limitations of their studies, as does a commentary published along with them. But only one limitation made it into the article: the caveat that the results may not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population because they only used data on patients enrolled in Medicare and Medicare Part D.
The biggest limitation goes unmentioned: There was no way to know if anyone was actually choosing to use marijuana instead of opioids.

Bergenstal said patients who are not achieving their goals with multiple daily injections should consider using a pump and sensor.\n\nDiabetes association guidelines recommend that most people with diabetes maintain A1C levels of 7.0 percent or below.\n\nIn the study, patients on pump therapy saw a reduction in average A1C levels of 0.8 percent, compared with a 0.2 percent average reduction for those who received multiple injections.

It touts benefits of insulin pumps and blood glucose sensors without mentioning potential harms. It fails to tell readers that the trial included only a subset of patients and thus the results may not necessarily apply to people with diabetes in general. It implies that the improvement seen in the intermediate endpoint measured (A1C blood sugar levels) will actually reduce the risk of eye, kidney, heart and other diseases without making clear that this trial was not designed to reveal differences in actual health outcomes. It makes no mention of the financial ties between the researchers and insulin pump manufacturers, even though the researchers’ published conflict of interest disclosure summary was substantially longer than the news story itself.

The study looked at 1,500 patients in Liberia, and took place amid and after the outbreak of Ebola in Liberia from 2014 into 2015.\n\nFive hundred participants received a vaccine developed by Merck & Co., 500 got one from GlaxoSmithKline PLC, which was based on work by the National Institutes of Health, and 500 received a placebo.\n\nWith the Merck vaccine, at one month, 83.7% of patients had developed antibodies to Ebola virus, versus 70.8% with the Glaxo vaccine and a negligible number, 2.8%, in the placebo group. The relationship of antibody responses was similar after 12 months, with 79.5%, 63.5% and 6.8% of patients, respectively, showing antibody response.\n\nThere is a “reasonable chance that either of these vaccines would play a role in preventing infection,” said H. Clifford Lane, deputy director for clinical research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a principal investigator in this study. NIAID is part of the National Institutes of Health. The Liberian Ministry of Health and other researchers also conducted the study.\n\nThe West African Ebola outbreak—the worst in recorded history—caused an estimated 11,000 deaths amid 25,582 cases in the three nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The hemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal in half or more cases, spread from West Africa to a handful of cases in Europe and the U.S., including among health care workers. The disease appears and disappears unpredictably in the African forests, and is widely believed to be spread by bats.\n\nIn Dr. Lane’s view, given previously existing positive evidence from a Guinea study of the Merck vaccine, if doctors in a future epidemic had to choose, it would probably be the one from Merck.\n\nThat Merck vaccine was shown to be “highly efficacious” during the Ebola epidemic in Guinea by World Health Organization doctors writing in The Lancet in December. But the methodology of that study—including the lack of a placebo group—raised questions among some scientists about how conclusive those findings were.\n\nA detailed report by the prestigious National Academy of Medicine in April questioned the methodology of the Merck vaccine study in Guinea. It concluded the Merck vaccine “most likely provides some protection” to recipients but that the protection “could in reality be quite low.”\n\nOne of the authors of that Academy of Medicine report, vaccine specialist and pediatrics professor Kathryn M. Edwards of Vanderbilt University, said the new evidence shows “the safety of the two vaccines is comparable.” But she said any comparison of the two vaccines based on the antibody evidence “is a bit undecided” because it is unknown precisely what antibody levels are needed to protect patients.\n\nMerck said the “safety and immunogenicity results observed” in this most recent research “are consistent with what we observed in other studies.” GSK said it is too early to know whether the immunity differences between the two vaccines “indicate a clinically meaningful difference.” The NIH/GSK vaccine was the focus of a page-one Wall Street Journal article about it and the NIH scientist, Nancy J. Sullivan, who developed it.\n\nThe two different studies arose through a kind of scientific war. Several British and other European medical groups, including some who funded the Guinea study of the Merck vaccine, had argued that giving any patients a placebo wasn’t ethical in the middle of a raging epidemic. But U.S. government doctors, including leaders of the NIH, said a placebo group was necessary to ensure patients truly got benefit, and weren’t harmed, from either a vaccine or a drug.\n\nThis current study, in Liberia, was designed to avoid those pitfalls through its classic placebo-controlled design. But it ran into another obstacle: Ebola cases in Liberia began to dwindle early in 2015, and the outbreak there was declared over on May 9 of that year. By the time this work was fully under way, it was too late to see if vaccines actually prevented Ebola sickness and death.\n\nIt still was possible, however, to measure patients’ immune-systems’ response, measured by how many produced significant antibodies to the Ebola virus. Also, vaccine safety could be assessed, and both vaccines appeared safe.\n\nNIH scientists now are evaluating antibody levels out to two years.\n\nThe level of serious adverse events was higher in the placebo group than either vaccine group, and “most of the serious adverse events were attributed to malaria,” the researchers wrote.\n\nWrite to Thomas M. Burton at tom.burton@wsj.com']","That said, we think the story would have been stronger had it been more clear on the industry connections behind the study, and if it had discussed availability of the vaccine–especially if a new outbreak occurs.","This Wall Street Journal story reports on a New England Journal of Medicine-published study of the trial of two potential vaccines against Ebola disease.

She wanted to be screened, and she knew just what kind of screening she wanted — a test that\'s so new, some women and doctors don\'t quite realize what they\'ve signed up for.\n\nThis kind of test , called cell free fetal DNA testing, uses a simple blood sample from an expectant mother to analyze bits of fetal DNA that have leaked into her bloodstream. It\'s only been on the market since October 2011 and is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration — the FDA does not regulate this type of genetic testing service. Several companies now offer the test, including Sequenom and Illumina. Insurance coverage varies, and doctors often only offer this testing to women at higher risk because of things like advanced maternal age.\n\n""I think that I initially heard about it through family and friends,"" says Seitz. ""They had had the option of it given to them by their doctors.""\n\nTo her, it sounded great. She didn\'t want an invasive procedure like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.Those are considered the gold standard for prenatal genetic testing, but doctors must put a needle into the womb to collect cells that contain fetal DNA, which means a small risk of miscarriage.\n\n""I wasn\'t interested in going as far as getting an amniocentesis because of the risk associated with that,"" she explains, ""and so when I heard about this test, that was part of the reason that I was most interested in it.""\n\nThis new way of testing fetal DNA seemed to have already become fairly common where Seitz used to live, in Washington, D.C. But she had recently moved to Alabama, and the clinic she went to there wasn\'t as familiar with it — although when she talked to her doctor, she learned the clinic had just had a visit from a company\'s sales representative.\n\n""I think it was a fairly new test for them at that point, but she was interested in pursuing it further to see what needed to be done,"" Seitz says.\n\nSeitz got her blood drawn last July, becoming one of hundreds of thousands of pregnant women who\'ve opted for this new kind of test instead of the more traditional, invasive ones. Doctors say the impact has been huge.\n\n""Those of us in the field who do diagnostic procedures like CVS and amnio have seen a drastic decrease in the number of those procedures that are being performed,"" says Dr. Mary Norton, an expert on maternal-fetal medicine and genetics at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Places are reporting doing fewer than half the number of procedures that were being done previously.""\n\nBut, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they\'re dealing with.\n\n""It\'s still new and it\'s quite different than previous genetic testing that\'s been available,"" says Norton. ""It\'s quite a different paradigm, if you will.""\n\nAn invasive test like amniocentesis or CVS lets doctors get a complete picture of the chromosomes and a solid diagnosis.\n\nUntil the new testing technology came along, the only less invasive option was for an expectant mother to get an ultrasound, plus have her blood tested for specific proteins. This can reveal if there\'s an increased risk of certain disorders, but it\'s not very accurate and produces a lot of false alarms.\n\nStudies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. They\'re less likely to flag a normal pregnancy as high risk.\n\n""They\'re much more accurate than current screening tests, but they are not diagnostic tests in the sense that amniocentesis is,"" says Norton, ""and so I think that has led to some confusion.""\n\nEven though the newer blood tests do look at fetal DNA, they can\'t give a definitive answer like an amniocentesis can because they\'re analyzing scraps of fetal DNA in the mother\'s blood that are all mixed up with her own DNA.\n\nNorton says when women get worrisome results from one of these new tests and are referred to her center, they sometimes don\'t understand why doctors are offering a follow-up amnio ""because they were under the impression that this was as good as an amnio.""\n\nShe is concerned that some people might end a pregnancy without getting confirmatory testing and points to one study last year that found a small number of women did that.\n\n""There\'s at least some evidence that it\'s happening to a greater degree than I think many of us are comfortable with,"" she says.\n\nThe tests are being used more and more widely. Some worry that the companies\' websites and marketing materials don\'t make the limitations clear enough.\n\nBut Dr. Lee Shulman doesn\'t see it that way. He\'s an obstetrician and geneticist at Northwestern University in Chicago who has consulted for a couple of the testing firms.\n\n""Patients need to understand that while this is better, it is not a diagnostic test, and I think the companies have done a great job in putting this material out,"" he says. ""Whether or not clinicians use this material and take it to heart and use it for patient counseling is a different story.""\n\nHe says the technology is so new that a lot of doctors have no experience with it, and consumers need to understand that.\n\n""If the patient, if the couple, are not getting the answers, not getting the information they feel comfortable with, they need to seek out prenatal diagnostic centers, maternal fetal specialists, clinical geneticists, who may have more experience,"" says Shulman.\n\nFor example, here\'s one thing that might turn out to be a little more complicated than would-be parents might expect. Along with screening for the common chromosomal disorders, companies offer parents the chance to learn their baby\'s sex — weeks before it\'s clear on a sonogram.\n\n""Many women are very excited by the idea that as part of their blood testing, they could find out pretty definitively if the baby is a boy or a girl,"" says Dr. Diana Bianchi, an expert on prenatal diagnostics at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nWhat they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there\'s something abnormal about the sex chromosomes.\n\n""Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there\'s an extra X or extra Y,"" she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio. Some babies with these conditions grow up into adulthood and never know they have them, unless they face a symptom like infertility.\n\nSeitz, in Alabama, thought it was a bonus that getting this new blood test would tell her if she was having a boy or a girl. But it actually didn\'t do that, because of a paperwork glitch.\n\n""The box for sex got unchecked somewhere along the way, so we weren\'t able to find it out from the test,"" says Seitz, who learned from an ultrasound that she was having a girl. The results she did get from the fetal DNA test were reassuring.']",Prenatal screening tests should not be confused with diagnostic tests. This story explains why.,"This story reports on several newer, noninvasive prenatal screening tests called cell-free DNA tests. These tests work by examining pieces of fetal DNA from a blood sample taken from the mother. Although more accurate than traditional screening tests (blood tests plus an ultrasound), the new tests are not accurate enough to provide a definitive diagnosis. This can only be obtained from a more invasive procedure such as amniocentesis. The story did a good job of explaining the confusion surrounding these new tests, which is a result of some doctors and women not understanding the tests’ limitations and accuracy levels compared with other tests. The story could have provided more numbers — including costs and false positive rates — to help readers better understand the tradeoffs involved.

More Americans kill themselves than die from breast cancer.\n\nAs Dr.Thomas Insel, longtime head of the National Institute of Mental Health, prepared to step down from his job in October, he cited the lack of progress in reducing the number of suicides as his biggest disappointment. While the homicide rate in the U.S. has dropped 50 percent since the early 1990s, the suicide rate is higher than it was a decade ago.\n\n""That to me is unacceptable,"" Insel says.\n\nIt hasn\'t been for lack of trying. The U.S. has a national suicide hotline, and there are suicide prevention programs in every state. There\'s screening, educational programs, and midnight walks to raise awareness. Yet over the past decade or so, the national suicide rate has increased. In 2003, the suicide rate was 10.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013, it was 12.6.\n\nAn effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide — depression — is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system\'s success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.\n\nThat approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.\n\nLynn, who\'s now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness ""is like the pain of having a cancer,"" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts — at times almost monthly.\n\n""When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,"" she says. ""I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in."" Sometimes she couldn\'t find anything to hang on to. ""Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,"" she says.\n\nThe program that saved Lynn almost didn\'t get off the ground.\n\nFifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.\n\nSome of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called ""perfect depression care"" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.\n\nThe mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.\n\nThe plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.\n\nIf the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care — cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient\'s medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.\n\nTherapists involve patients\' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don\'t leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with ""safety plans.""\n\nLynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists\' phone numbers. And there\'s a reminder that the feeling will pass — it has before.\n\nBefore the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn\'t work very well, she says.\n\nToday, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. ""There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,"" says Espiritu, ""and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan."" The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.\n\nFor Lynn, the key was persistence — her therapists\', and her own. ""I recall one time with my psychiatrist, who kept trying to encourage me and help me find ways of coping, and I can remember saying, \'I don\'t believe there\'s hope, I don\'t see it, I don\'t feel it, I need you to hold on to that for me because it\'s not there,\' "" she recalls.\n\nHer therapists never gave up. ""There is no question that the message I got from Day 1 is that they knew they could help me, and they would help me,"" Lynn says. Over the years she\'s been in group therapy, day treatment, and, when things got bad, the emergency room.\n\nThe Henry Ford approach is catching on. A stream of visitors from U.S. health insurers and from the United Kingdom have made site visits. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has run two zero suicide training academies for teams from health care systems based on the Henry Ford principles. Other health systems have adapted the plan, including Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and the behavioral health provider Centerstone in Tennessee.\n\nEspiritu started work at Henry Ford just as the program was starting, and she remembers the initial staff meetings: ""There was a lot of, \'How can you do this? How can you aim for zero? How can you expect your clinicians to be perfect and follow this protocol?\' "" Some people didn\'t think it could be done, she says, or even attempted.\n\nStill, the health system went ahead, and the rewards were nearly immediate. Henry Ford epidemiologist Brian Ahmedani studies the numbers. In 2009, for those being actively treated for a mental health problem or substance abuse, ""we had a rate of zero per hundred thousand,"" he says. It\'s crept up to 20 per 100,000 per year, but that\'s still 80 percent lower than it was when the program began. The rate is five per 100,000 in the organization\'s general population, which is well below the national average and has remained steady despite an increasing rate of suicide statewide.\n\nPreventing Suicide National Suicide Hotline: (800) 273-8255, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org Suicide Prevention Resource Center: www.sprc.org American Foundation for Suicide Prevention: www.afsp.org National Institute of Mental Health: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention\n\nThere\'s reason to think a full-bore effort to treat depression could reduce health costs, because untreated depression is associated with higher medical bills for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. But there are training costs involved, and the Henry Ford system has had to keep its staffing up to be able to provide care for people who need it.\n\nOfficials at Henry Ford say they haven\'t analyzed the costs. But Centerstone has. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who\'d already made a suicide attempt. Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.\n\nWhy push for zero, rather than just a reduction? ""Because if you say we\'re OK with five a year, one of those might be your brother or your friend,"" says Espiritu. ""We aim for zero because it reminds all of us of what we would want for ourselves."" Maybe it is not possible, she says. But it is a goal.\n\nAnd as for Lynn, she doesn\'t consider herself cured. She says with the treatment she\'s received at Henry Ford, she\'s learned to live, even thrive, with bipolar disease. And she\'s alive. That, she says, makes her a big success story.']","A solid exploration of one health system’s suicide prevention program, although it may overstate the role of that program in causing the dramatic drop in suicides reported.","The story looks at an attempt by the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Mich., to eliminate suicide in its patients by taking a proactive approach to identifying and treating depression. The program, which was launched in 2001, is associated with a significant reduction in the suicide rate among its patients, even as suicide rates have gone up nationally.
The story is a richly told exploration of the program and its impact. And the storytelling substantively addresses the majority of our criteria. The major hole in this piece is that it doesn’t explore alternate explanations for the drop in suicides in this health system that might not have had anything to do with depression care. Inclusion of an independent perspective might have helped identify some of those reasons.

Of those, between one third and one half have a type of lazy eye known as anisometropia, which is caused by a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes.\n\nStandard treatment for children involves eyeglasses or contact lens designed to correct focus issues. However, while this approach is often successful in younger children (between the ages of 3 and 7), it is successful among only about a third of older children (between the ages of 7 and 12).\n\nFor the latter group, doctors will often place a patch over the ""good"" eye temporarily in addition to eyeglasses, and treatment success is typically achieved in two-thirds of cases.\n\nChildren, however, often have trouble adhering to patch therapy, the treatment can bring emotional issues for some and a reverse form of lazy eye can also take root, the researchers said.\n\nStudy author Dr. Dennis S.C. Lam, from the department of ophthalmology and visual sciences and Institute of Chinese Medicine at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues report their observations in the December issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology.\n\nIn the search for a better option than patch therapy, Lam and his associates set out to explore the potential benefits of acupuncture, noting that it has been used to treat dry eye and myopia.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Lam and his colleagues recruited 88 children between the ages of 7 and 12 who had been diagnosed with anisometropia.\n\nAbout half the children were treated five times a week with acupuncture, targeting five specific acupuncture needle insertion points (located at the top of the head and the eyebrow region, as well as the legs and hands). The other half were given two hours a day of patch therapy, combined with a minimum of one hour per day of near-vision exercises such as reading.\n\nAfter about four months of treatment, the research team found that overall visual acuity improved markedly more among the acupuncture group relative to the patch group. In fact, they noted that while lazy eye was successfully treated in nearly 42 percent of the acupuncture patients, that figure dropped to less than 17 percent among the patch patients.\n\nNeither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said.\n\nThe team nonetheless pointed out that their study\'s tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist.\n\nAnd while theorizing that the apparent success of this alternative approach may have something to do with stimulating blood flow, retinal nerve growth and visual cortex activity, the authors acknowledged that the exact mechanism by which it works remains poorly understood.\n\nDr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that the finding is ""certainly suggestive and worth following up.""\n\n""This is kind of cool,"" he said. ""But I will say that I don\'t know of any study looking at acupuncture and vision. There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there\'s pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I\'ve heard of it, and I don\'t know that anyone has ever tried this before. So this is like a teaser.""\n\n""Of course people in those parts of the country, like where I live, where there\'s fairly wide acceptance of alternative medicine might receive this type of treatment better than others,"" Bensinger cautioned. ""And no question patients will gravitate towards treatments that are covered by their insurance even if it\'s not the best treatment. And as an alternative approach, this may not be covered.""\n\n""But if it works,"" he added, ""people will certainly be excited -- although it certainly needs further testing and further studies to decide if it\'s really beneficial or not.""\n\nFor his part, Dr. Stanley Chang, chairman of the ophthalmology department at Columbia University in New York City, did not seem to hold out much promise for acupuncture\'s potential as an alternative lazy eye therapy.\n\n""Acupuncture I think definitely works for pain amelioration, but I\'m not sure it works for some of these other things,"" he cautioned. ""They\'ve tried it for the treatment of myopia and glaucoma, without much success. And so although there haven\'t been any really good trials comparing acupuncture with conventional therapies, my guess is that it\'s probably not going to do much for the treatment of lazy eye.""\n\n""However, I think it\'s worth considering or trying,"" Chang added, ""because nothing else seems to work very well for patients of that age, including patch therapy. But what will need is a very carefully controlled study that accounts for all the variables that might have an impact on the outcome of this approach.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on amblyopia, visit the National Eye Institute.']","This story earned the same number of stars as the other one we reviewed on the results of this acupuncture trial, but the failure to quantify just how much difference was seen in patients leaves readers wondering.","This story offered an informative but flawed summary of a study that tested acupuncture to treat a form of “lazy eye” known as anisometropic amblyopia. It was at its best when describing why the trial, despite its positive results, provides only preliminary evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for this condition. On the downside, it offered only a vague description of how the researchers assessed the treatment effects in this study, making the discussion of benefits much less meaningful than that provided in the competing coverage from WebMD.

These infants often don’t survive and, even if they do, many have substantial long-term health problems.\n\nThis new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides what is thought to be the best, large-scale data in the U.S. to date on this topic. The authors, from many institutions that form a large neonatal research network funded by the National Institutes of Health, studied nearly 5,000 babies born before 27 weeks at two-dozen high-quality hospitals across the country who were followed to 18-22 months of age.\n\nThose who were born at 22 weeks of gestation survived only 5% of the time. Of those who received active treatment to help them breathe or their hearts to beat, 23% lived, 15.4% survived without severe neurological impairment, such as cerebral palsy, and 9% survived without severe or moderate neurological impairment.\n\nIn comparison, the vast majority—more than 80% -- of those born at week 26 survived with or without active care and nearly 60% had no severe or moderate neurological impairment.\n\n“A large proportion of the variation [in outcome], especially at 22, 23 and 24 weeks, can be explained by differences in whether treatment was initiated,” said Matthew Rysavy, the first author on the paper and a medical student at the University of Iowa.\n\nThe findings don’t lead to a clear-cut conclusion about when and whether lifesaving care should be administered to the extremely premature, but provide more data to help inform doctors and families when they make their decision, said Mr. Rysavy.\n\nJust 22% of babies born at 22 weeks were given lifesaving treatments compared with 72% of babies born at week 23 and 97% of babies born at week 24. The type of care they received tended to depend on the hospital where they were born. However, it isn’t clear from the data why the decision was made to provide a particular type of care, and what other factors played a role in the babies’ outcomes besides whether they were given active treatments, said the authors.\n\nElizabeth Rogers, director of the Intensive Care Nursery Follow Up Program at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco , who wasn’t involved in the study, called the new study important because it highlights the large variation in outcomes for these very premature infants.\n\nThe paper “shows that the question of when a premature infant can survive is so multifactorial and complex that no simple equation is going to be able to predict the outcome for any individual baby,” said Dr. Rogers, a pediatrics professor.\n\nThe study suggests that with intervention, more babies may live. “But if meaningful, functional, fully participatory life is what they want, I think the study also shows this is not something we can promise them at these ages,” said Dr. Rogers.\n\nThe University of California San Francisco has never resuscitated a baby born at 22 weeks because its own data suggest that at such an early gestational age, the “risks of poor outcome have outweighed the possibility of a really good outcome for families,” said Dr. Rogers, who said she wouldn’t change her clinical practice based on the new study results.\n\nThursday’s findings also highlight the importance for counseling parents, including about their child’s longer-term prognosis, and the need for a standard approach of what and how to tell them, according to Dr. Rogers.\n\nPart of that conversation could be the survival rate not of all babies born at an early gestational age, but just those who received active treatment, said the University of Iowa’s Mr. Rysavy.\n\nAt the University of Iowa’s hospital, after having a conversation with parents of babies born at 22 weeks, the majority want their babies treated, said Edward Bell, another author on the paper and a pediatrics professor at the university.\n\n“These are very difficult decisions and they need to made on a case-by-case basis by the families and physicians,” said Dr. Bell.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nElizabeth Rogers’s last name was misspelled as Rodgers in an earlier version of this article (5/8/15). Also, a statistical result from the study was incorrectly described in an earlier version of this article. The survival rate for all week 22 infants reflected those who received active treatment as well as those who didn’t, not just those who didn’t receive active treatment (5/12/15).\n\nWrite to Shirley S. Wang at shirley.wang@wsj.com']",A thorough Wall Street Journal report on a new study that explores the relationship between active medical intervention and survival — a topic considered to be controversial among pediatric experts.,"
When a baby is born at the edge of viability, the question of what action to take is a difficult and controversial one. The risks of poor outcomes are high, even if the baby survives. The Wall Street Journal highlights a new study that explores the relationship between the decision to pursue active treatment and the rates of survival and impairment. What was surprising was that the variation across centers in pursuing aggressive medical care was substantial, and it is clear that hospitals have different policies in treating babies at low gestational ages.
The article does a great job providing balance to these two approaches (active intervention versus palliative care), weighing a baby’s chances of survival with the risks of suffering from severe impairment in the future. The independent doctor quoted in the story gives a unique perspective on how clinicians may interpret the study’s findings and why aggressive medical interventions at early gestational ages may not be optimal.
Overall, this is solid health news reporting — something we are always happy to see.

And for now, the research is preliminary, so it\'s too early to know for sure if the treatment is appropriate to be used for any kind of depression.\n\nStill, the study suggests that brain stimulation ""not only just helps patients who haven\'t been able to recover from depression, but it seems to be associated with the absence of relapses. They\'re not only getting better, they\'re staying better,"" said study co-author Dr. Helen Mayberg, a professor in both the departments of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and neurology, at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n\nIn deep brain stimulation, surgeons insert wires into the brain that allows a specific region to be continuously hit with an electronic pulse. The level of stimulation is controlled by a pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest.\n\nDeep brain stimulation has been around for more than 20 years, Mayberg said, and is commonly used to treat Parkinson\'s disease. The cost of the surgery is about $50,000, she said.\n\nPrevious research by Mayberg and others suggested that deep brain stimulation had potential as a treatment for depression. The St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation company, which has provided consulting fees to Mayberg and some of the other study authors, is currently recruiting patients for a study that could pave the way for its approval as a treatment for depression, Mayberg said.\n\nThe new study, which appears online Jan. 2 in the Archives of General Psychiatry, began with 10 patients with depression and seven with bipolar disorder -- a condition that causes severe mood swings and is also known as manic depression. They all received deep brain stimulation for 24 weeks after going through four weeks either with or without stimulation.\n\nMost of the patients continued to receive the treatment over two years, although researchers temporarily turned it off in three of them as part of the study before realizing that doing so caused their depression to return.\n\nThe researchers found that 18 percent of patients went into remission after 24 weeks, 36 percent (of 14 patients) after one year. After two years, of the 12 patients still in the study, seven patients (58 percent) were in remission.\n\n""The number of patients who got better increased over time, but it\'s not quite clear as to why,"" Mayberg said. The workings of deep brain stimulation as a whole are a mystery, although Mayberg said it may work by changing the brain\'s rhythms.\n\nPatients didn\'t suffer from side effects, she noted.\n\nSo, what\'s next?\n\nDr. Samuel James Collier, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Austin, predicted that even if deep brain stimulation turns out to be an effective treatment for depression, it\'ll be far from the first line of defense.\n\n""Medications and ECT -- electroconvulsive therapy -- are clearly safer, better tolerated, and do not embody a large surgical risk,"" Collier said. ""I can\'t think of a scenario where deep brain stimulation would be considered even remotely before medications and ECT were exhausted.""\n\nStill, he said, it\'s important to note that ""we seem to be making progress and hopefully those who are suffering the most can find solace in that and not give up hope.""\n\nFor now, research continues. If patients are interested in deep brain stimulation treatment, they should try to get into the study that\'s ongoing, Mayberg said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about deep brain stimulation, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']",Strong point:  caveats up high in the story.  Weaker points: confusing presentation of data.,"This solid story on a very small study of deep brain stimulation gives readers a lot of the information they need, but it also likely will lead to some confusion about what the study found. With a little more work clarifying the potential benefits of the treatment and a better discussion of the potential side effects, this story would have provided much more helpful information on a breaking study.

It dilates blood vessels, giving it the potential to ease an abrupt cold water-induced constriction of blood vessels in the arms and legs that can lead to blood pooling in the heart and lungs.\n\nAthletes and others with this condition -- called swimming-induced pulmonary edema, or SIPE -- cough up blood, labor to breathe and have low blood-oxygen typically brought on by swimming or scuba diving, usually in cold water. Often the symptoms dissipate over 24 hours, but the condition can be serious and even fatal and medical attention is recommended. Many don\'t know they are prone to the problem until they are in the water and quickly develop symptoms.\n\n""During immersion in water, particularly cold water, susceptible people have an exaggerated degree of the normal redistribution of blood from the extremities to the chest area, causing increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs and leakage of fluid into the lungs,"" said Richard Moon, M.D., an anesthesiologist and medical director of the Duke Center for Hyperbaric Medicine & Environmental Physiology.\n\n""Some cases of SIPE appear to have been the result of cardiac problems,"" said Moon, who was lead author of the study published online February 16 in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nMoon and colleagues studied these responses in 10 athletes who had experienced the condition while exercising or competing in triathlons. During a carefully monitored test in Duke\'s hyperbaric center, the researchers had the participants exercise under water in a dive pool that recreated the conditions of a swim that could trigger the SIPE response.\n\nThey compared those participants with 20 others who did not have a history of SIPE. None of the participants in either group had heart abnormalities, but the SIPE-susceptible athletes had higher pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure during the underwater exercise, confirming that SIPE is a form of pulmonary edema caused by high pressure in the blood vessels within the lungs.\n\nWhen the SIPE participants were given sildenafil and then performed the same underwater exercise, the pressures were no longer as elevated.\n\n""This is a small study, but also very intensive with direct, accurate pressure measurements,"" Moon said. ""It appears that the drug, which dilates the blood vessels, could be creating more capacity in the blood vessels in the arms and legs, reducing the tendency for blood to redistribute to the thorax, and therefore reducing the high pressure in the pulmonary vessels.""\n\nOne study participant, triathlete Katherine Calder-Becker, said her bouts with SIPE threatened to end her competitive career. She said she would have no problems during training in swimming pools, but then experienced debilitating shortness of breath and distress during the swim portions of competitions in colder open water. She coughed up blood and was once hospitalized.\n\nTriathlete Calder-Becker, 51, was diagnosed with SIPE and enrolled in studies at Duke in 2011. Afterward, she consulted her cardiologist and was prescribed a low dose of sildenafil that she takes shortly before competitions.\n\n""I have successfully raced in 20 triathlons since I started taking sildenafil, including five ultra events that require 10-kilometer swims,"" Calder-Becker said. ""I have not had an incident since then. I didn\'t want to give up racing -- this is something my husband and I do together, and we travel together to competitions -- so it has meant everything to me to continue.""\n\nMoon said larger studies are needed to replicate the results and learn more about possible adverse side effects of the drug. He also said research is ongoing to further illuminate the causes of SIPE and potential ways of diagnosing it early.\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Moon, study authors include Stefanie D. Martina, Dionne F. Peacher, Jennifer F. Potter, Tracy E. Wester, Anne D. Cherry, Michael J. Natoli, Claire E. Otteni, Dawn N. Kernagis, William D. White, and John J. Freiberger.\n\nThis study received funding from the Divers Alert Network and U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command Contracts (N61331-03-C-0015, N0463A-07-C-0002).']",This news release uses a patient story to tout the benefits of Viagra for a rare lung condition affecting swimmers. The study itself was far less definitive than the patient’s glowing anecdote.,"This news release describes a small study of individuals prone to swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE, fluid in the lung) that found that giving them a dose of sildenafil (sold under the brand name Viagra) dilated blood vessels and prevented the cold water-induced constriction that may cause the problem. The study involved 10 individuals with a history of SIPE and 20 control subjects.
The news release, based on the study published in the journal Circulation, describes the condition and the study parameters nicely but then overwhelms the cautionary comments appropriate for such a modest design with an enthusiastic testimonial from a participant who felt the medicine was a life-changer. The release would be stronger if it had added some quantification of the benefits and relied less on a patient testimonial to make its case.

Atherosclerotic disease, in which plaque buildup narrows the brain arteries, is one of the most common causes of strokes.\n\nNeurosurgeons performing EDAS reroute arteries from the scalp and the membranes that cover the brain and place these arteries under the skull near areas of the brain at risk of stroke. Over time, new blood vessels form, creating fresh pathways for blood and oxygen to reach the brain.\n\nThe trial, led by Nestor R. Gonzalez, MD, professor of Neurosurgery and director of the Neurovascular Laboratory at Cedars-Sinai, enrolled 52 patients with severe brain atherosclerosis, also known as intracranial atherosclerotic disease, or ICAD, who showed symptoms of either a recent stroke or a mini-stroke, called a transient ischemic attack. These patients received EDAS surgery, along with intensive medical management, which included diet and lifestyle changes, blood thinners and other medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.\n\nAfter one year, 9.6 percent of the patients treated with the surgery experienced another ischemic stroke or died, compared with 21.2 percent of patients in a matched control group who received only intensive medical management. Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported.\n\n""Our findings in this intermediate-stage trial are promising for applying EDAS surgery to intracranial atherosclerotic disease,"" said Gonzalez said. Previously, EDAS has been used for moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disorder that affects younger patients.\n\nGonzalez said the new trial addressed a serious medical need. ""Even under the best current treatments, ICAD carries high rates of recurrent stroke and death, compared with other causes of stroke,"" he said. ""Developing new therapeutic strategies is crucial for ICAD patients.""\n\nCurrent ICAD therapies--in addition to intensive medical management--include bypass surgery to connect a blood vessel from outside the brain to a vessel inside the brain, as well as angioplasty with stenting, which involves inflating a tiny balloon inside a cerebral artery to open it up and placing a stent device inside the artery. Despite advances in medical care, annual rates of recurrent stroke and death are remain high, at 15 percent or more for ICAD patients, according to published research.\n\nGonzalez said his team is working with the stroke prevention working group of the National Institutes of Health to develop a proposal for a Phase III randomized clinical trial across multiple institutions to further test the effectiveness of EDAS as compared with intensive medical management. While this Phase IIa trial selected patients from previous studies as the control group, the Phase III study would enroll new ICAD patients for both the control and experimental groups, he explained.\n\n""This clinical trial moves us significantly closer to preventing strokes and death in high-risk populations,"" said Keith Black, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery. ""As a nationally renowned physician-investigator, Dr. Gonzalez personifies the dedication of Cedars-Sinai to translating the most advanced research into new cures.""\n\n###\n\nBesides Gonzalez, the trial involved other investigators from the stroke centers of Cedars-Sinai and UCLA.\n\nFunding: Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Strokes of the National Institutes of Health under award number K23NS079477-01A1.']",The study results do not establish that the surgery was more effective than medical management as claimed in the news release.,"This release from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center describes a phase 2 clinical trial that looked at whether an existing surgical procedure could be used to reduce the rate of recurrent strokes or death among patients with severe brain artery blockages.
It gives a numerical comparison between those benefiting from the surgery and those who only received “intensive medical management.”  And the researchers state that those results show that the procedure — encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) — “significantly decreases the rate of stroke recurrence and death.” However, the difference between these groups for the main outcome of the study was not statistically significant — which should have been clearly disclosed and which contradicts the stated claim that the surgery is more effective. We call on Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and EurekAlert! to retract or correct the release before it leads to misleading news coverage about this procedure.

But it\'s not the most accurate, according to new guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology that urge doctors instead to use a special type of MRI whenever possible.\n\nThat\'s a recommendation that isn\'t winning universal acclaim from doctors, who say CTs tend to be far more readily available and take less time to administer.\n\nAccording to the guidelines published Monday in the journal Neurology, a type of brain scan known as diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is superior to computed tomography, or CT, for diagnosing strokes caused by lack of blood flow to the brain -- by far the most common cause of stroke, accounting for nearly 90 percent of them.\n\nDr. Peter Schellinger, the lead author of the new guidelines, said his research team reviewed studies dating to 1966 and confirmed that diffusion MRI is considerably better at detecting the severity of stroke damage than a CT scan. That\'s important because, ""in general, the more you know about a problem, in this case stroke, the better you can react to problems,"" said Schellinger, of the Johannes Wesling clinical center in Minden, Germany.\n\nCT scans are a specialized kind of X-ray that provides three-dimensional images. Diffusion MRI -- a different type of imaging that doesn\'t involve X-rays -- shows where brain damage has occurred by measuring how easily water flows through the brain.\n\nSchellinger said that there are circumstances in which a CT scan should remain the preferred diagnostic tool -- for instance, when waiting for an MRI would delay immediate treatment with clot-busting drugs and also for patients who can\'t be screened with MRI because they have a pacemaker or metallic implants.\n\nAt Chicago area hospitals, suspected stroke victims usually are given a CT scan first, followed by an MRI. Changing that might not be easy, doctors say.\n\n""Does every emergency room in the country have an MRI available 24 hours a day? I would venture to guess the answer is no and resoundingly no,"" said Dr. Shyam Prabhakaran, director of the stroke program at Rush University Medical Center. ""Even in institutions like ours, where we can get an MRI done quickly as the first test, can you do it quicker than a CT scan?""\n\nDr. Jordan Rosenblum, an associate professor of radiology at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, also has doubts about whether hospital practices will change quickly.\n\n""Maybe we need to adjust our protocols, but it\'s not as simple as saying we have two modalities, and we\'ve proven that MRI is better, so now we should move to MRI,"" Rosenblum said.\n\nBut once it\'s as quick to get an MRI done as a CT, Rosenblum said, ""Then, I do see it replacing CT in a growing number of cases.""']",The story dances around – but mostly misses – key issues about whether the new guidelines would result in better outcomes (unknown) or in higher or lower health care costs (unknown).  Better pictures don’t always mean better outcomes. ,"The American Academy of Neurology has set new guidelines for correctly diagnosing most strokes, recommending a type of MRI over a CT scan. The study, a literature review of MRI and CT studies going back to 1966, was published in the academy’s journal, Neurology. The story, however, does not make it clear how much better the MRI performs nor how much a switch to MRIs nationwide would cost. It does do a good job, though, of finding voices critical of the practicality of such a switch.

The studies reported on are newsworthy and there’s certainly some interesting and useful information here. But what’s missing from the piece are key details, including the fact that these drugs can cause significant side effects that may lead some women to stop taking them. Consulting an independent expert may have shed light on this issue for readers.
We also think some of the language used in the story was misleading. The headline focuses the “one-two punch” of using the two types of drugs in combination, but there is no evidence in either meta-analysis to support combining the two drugs. Since that wasn’t an element of the research being reported on, why leap to that in a headline?

He\'s a professor of medicine and director of Vanderbilt University\'s heart clinical research program in Nashville.\n\nPeople with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. These include medications to lower blood pressure and diuretics to help remove excess fluid that builds up as a result of the heart\'s labored pumping ability. In addition, some people have implanted defibrillators or pacemakers.\n\nEven with all these options, the death rate among these patients is ""unacceptably high,"" Lenihan said.\n\nHeart failure, a condition where the heart can\'t pump enough blood to meet the body\'s needs, is among the leading causes of death worldwide. A significant number of heart failure patients don\'t respond well to current treatments, particularly those patients whose left lower heart chamber, which pumps blood into the arteries, is weak, Lenihan said.\n\nCimaglermin acts as a growth factor for the heart, helping it repair itself following injury, Lenihan said. Specifically, it binds to the HER2 and HER4 receptors on the surface of heart cells that are important for cellular repair and survival, he explained.\n\nResearchers have tried using stem cells to repair heart muscle in much the same way, he said, but these efforts have not been effective. ""You don\'t see any sustained effect,"" he added.\n\nA phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said.\n\n""This drug, although still in an experimental phase, might be an important way to improve heart function in patients with heart failure,"" he said.\n\nFor the study, Lenihan and his colleagues randomly assigned 40 patients to get an infusion of cimaglermin or a placebo.\n\nCompared with patients who received a placebo, patients given a high dose of cimaglermin had a sustained increase in the heart\'s ability to pump blood. The improvement lasted 90 days, with the maximum increase in heart function reached in 28 days, the researchers found.\n\nThe most common side effects were headache and nausea directly after receiving the drug. One patient who received the highest dose of cimaglermin developed abnormal liver function, which cleared up over a two-week period, Lenihan said.\n\nThe study was funded by Acorda Therapeutics, the maker of cimaglermin, and the report was published online Dec. 26 in the journal JACC: Basic to Translational Science.\n\nDr. Nanette Bishopric is a professor of medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the author of an accompanying journal editorial. ""There haven\'t been breakthrough treatments for heart failure for a long time,"" she said.\n\nCimaglermin, however, may be such a drug, she said. ""It\'s a remarkable thing that you could give a drug once and have it affect heart function three months later -- it\'s really extraordinary,"" she said.\n\nEvery drug currently used to treat heart failure has to be given daily or several times a day to get it to work, Bishopric said. ""And when you stop taking it, it stops working,"" she said.\n\nDespite the encouraging results of this first trial, a lot more testing will be needed before cimaglermin can be considered a standard treatment for heart failure, Bishopric said.\n\n""These findings need to be replicated in larger trials, and you have to be able to predict whether improved heart function from cimaglermin will help people live longer and feel better,"" she noted.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on heart failure, visit the American Heart Association.']",The story would have been stronger if it had detailed exactly what the researchers were measuring when they concluded the drug worked better than placebo.,"This HealthDay story reports on the very early results of a phase one trial of a drug, cimaglermin, intended to improve the left ventricular function among patients with a type of heart failure known as “severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.”
The story does clearly say that it is a phase one trial and explains that clinical use of the drug may be years away, if then. The story would have been stronger if it had detailed exactly what the researchers were measuring when they concluded the drug worked better than placebo.

In fact, the last year has been so bleak on the research front that some experts are questioning whether a long-desired safe and effective diet pill can be found.\n\nAdvisory panels for the Food and Drug Administration recommended against approval of two experimental weight-loss drugs this year — Lorqess in September and Qnexa in July — citing unacceptable risks for unimpressive benefits. Another drug, Meridia, was withdrawn from the market in October after it was linked to higher risks of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nLast week, an advisory panel did finally recommend approval of a weight-loss drug: Contrave, a combination of two existing drugs, the antidepressant bupropion and the anti-addiction medication naltrexone. (FDA rulings for all three drugs are expected next year.) But it did so with a marked lack of enthusiasm, citing the medication\'s poor effectiveness and a need to closely track health risks, such as high blood pressure, once the drug is in broad use.\n\nAs drug after drug falters or falls by the wayside, doctors who treat obese patients are growing increasingly frustrated. They say that the agency\'s standards for approving anti-obesity drugs are overly stringent and fail to recognize the health risks associated with carrying extra weight — at a time when almost 34% of U.S. adults are obese and almost 6% are morbidly obese, and when study after study has shown that the most that can be hoped for from diets and exercise, on average, is a 10% loss of body weight sustained for at least one year.\n\nSo gloomy is the climate for these drugs that some experts fear drug companies will out-and-out abandon the anti-obesity market.\n\n""Every big company is going to get out of the game, and venture capitalists are not going to invest in the smaller companies to develop drugs,"" Dr. Donna Ryan, past president of the Obesity Society, said in October during that group\'s annual meeting in San Diego.

They’re poked and prodded and scoped in an effort to figure out what’s complicating conception.\n\nWhile it’s just as likely that infertility is related to the male half of the couple, only 20% of men in duos struggling to make a baby get a sperm-count analysis early on or at all, according to data from SpermCheck Fertility, which earlier this month announced the availability of its at-home screening test for men. SpermCheck, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, assesses sperm count with 98% accuracy in 10 minutes and does away with the unpleasantness of conjuring up a sperm sample in a doctor’s office. As SpermCheck’s website puts it, a “trip to a fertility clinic for a semen analysis is not for everyone. These tests can be expensive (costing hundreds of dollars and not typically covered by insurance), inconvenient and are often embarrassing.”\n\nMORE: ‘Sonicated’ Sperm: Could Ultrasound Be the Next Male Contraceptive?\n\nLow sperm count, or oligospermia, is a main cause of male infertility. By addressing the issue, SpermCheck will join a crowded infertility market that includes more than 20 types of female-fertility tests in Walgreen stores alone. For women who are having trouble getting pregnant, the test may very well be one they — and not their squeamish partners — snap up along with over-the-counter ovulation kits.\n\n“In our society, the woman carries the burden of trying to determine the issues surrounding infertility,” Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, told Bloomberg News. “Men don’t say, ‘Let me go to the urologist and give a semen sample.’” That reluctance has created a $440 million-a-year market for male fertility tests in the U.S., Lopez says.\n\nThe test reveals whether sperm count appears normal, at 20 million or more sperm per ml; lower than that indicates a trip to the doctor is pretty much unavoidable.

Patients are treated for one hour a day, five days a week over six weeks.\n\n“We see improvement lasting for 9-12 months and the good thing is that patients can return and undergo treatment again,” Baror said. “If out of 10 years the patients have left to live we can keep them at home in a relatively mild state of the disease for three, four, five years, it’s a lot.”\n\nAccording to Alvaro Pascual-Leone, director of the hospital’s Berenson-Allen Centre for Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, brain stimulation - or transcranial magnetic stimulation - involves a very low current applied to a specific part of the brain and is approved by the FDA for treatment of a variety of ailments and diagnostic applications.\n\n“The application in Alzheimer’s disease and in combination with cognitive training is novel,” Pascual-Leono said in a phone interview from Boston.\n\nAbout 20 percent of patients experience a mild headache but there are no long-term negative effects, he said.\n\nPascual-Leone, who is principal investigator in the Harvard trial, said that of 12 patients in the study, six received the real treatment and all showed cognitive improvement.

story_reviews_00638,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/labeled-news-one-mds-opinion-pap-smearpelvic-exam-guidelines/,2015-04-13 04:00:00,The real importance of getting a pap smear and pelvic exam,"['In 2012, I was shocked to learn that new guidelines issued by the The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated that women should wait three to five years between pap smears, which are the primary method of screening for cervical cancer. Thanks to that recommendation, which has influenced insurance company policies, annual pap tests are no longer the standard of care today— and I see that as a huge problem.\n\nFor one, the three- to five-year interval between screening tests for women ages 21 to 65 doesn’t take into account the several risk factors that boost a woman’s chance of developing cervical cancer, such as multiple sexual partners, a weakened immune system that occurs with smoking, and even oral contraceptive use for more than five years. For these women, there is a still a serious need for more frequent cervical cancer screening, but nowhere in the guidelines are these risk factors addressed. Unfortunately, the only risk factor that changes the recommended frequency of screening is an abnormal pap result in the past.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\nI watched a 28-year-old woman die of cervical cancer during my OB-GYN residency, and it was horrible. I don’t see why major medical organizations have made a recommendation that puts women at risk of a cancer that can be so easily prevented— and frankly, I see it as more of an economic decision than anything else.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at what this means: Let’s say you have multiple sexual partners and during a visit to your gynecologist, this information flies under the radar for whatever reason. (A woman with multiple sexual partners has a greater chance of acquiring HPV, the virus that causes most cervical cancers.) By the same token, no one brings up the issue of your partner’s number of partners. And by the way, you can never be 100 percent positive that your partner is monogamous— no one can! The greater the number of partners he has, the greater his risk of contracting HPV and passing it to you. So you aren’t given cervical cancer screening that day when, in fact, many doctors would agree that you need it.\n\nAnother problem I have with the current guidelines is this: New recommendations published last summer in the Annals of Internal Medicine advised physicians to stop offering routine pelvic exams to asymptomatic, average-risk women. I find this outrageous. Pelvic exams allow your physician to inspect the vulva for changes, and even feel around the ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes for any masses. The delay to diagnosis of vulvar cancer, specifically, is about 18 months. A gynecologist is trained to detect early changes, and then do a biopsy for anything suspicious. As a diagnostic and screening tool, the pelvic exam is vital.\n\nWhat makes all of this even worse: No more pelvic exams and infrequent paps mean women won’t see their gynecologist as regularly, and they may miss opportunities to voice concerns related to their reproductive health. An annual well-woman visit with your gynecologist allows you to discuss your health status, sexual practices, contraception needs, and get a breast exam, among other things— so it’s still important for you to go, even if you don’t end up having a pap or pelvic exam.\n\nUltimately, when it comes to gynecological cancer screening tests, every woman has individual risk factors, so you should talk to your doctor about yours. If you fall into any of the high risk categories— you have multiple partners, you smoke or are otherwise immunocompromised, and you’ve been on birth control pills for five years or more— you really should be screened at least every other year. If you’re insurance denies to cover this, you should fight them on the basis of being at a higher risk.\n\nAnd always be sure to visit your gyno if you’re having any sort of symptom, such as pelvic pain, irregular discharge, or sexual dysfunction— all of which can point to a more serious problem. In these cases, you should be given a pelvic exam at the very least.\n\nDr. Jennifer Landa is Chief Medical Officer of BodyLogicMD, the nation\'s largest franchise of physicians specializing in bioidentical hormone therapy.

Aside from the issue of balance, there are many factual errors in the science in this piece, particularly in the section on Pap smears.  Of our 3 reviewers on this piece, the physician-reviewer, with expertise in women’s health, said she discounted the credibility of the article because of the medical misinformation and lack of balance in that first section on cervical cancer screening. That’s too bad, because the topic raised in the second part, on the value of pelvic exams, is a worthwhile area for debate.  It is part of a larger discussion on the value of periodic visits — “annual exams” — that allow a doctor and patient to develop the shared medical history and level of trust that some say is a crucial part of excellent and effective health care, even if it is a difficult area to measure.

Reich for USA TODAY Scar marks the spot: ""My leg is already stronger than it was a year ago,"" says Torres. CARTILAGE AS CUSHION CARTILAGE AS CUSHION Articular cartilage is located at bone endings, providing a cushion and preventing bone from connecting with other bone. Why cartilage doesn\'t heal on its own: It has limited ability to repair itself because it doesn\'t have a blood supply. Why it hurts: When cartilage is damaged or worn down, bone hits bone where the sensitive nerve endings are located. Is ACI for you? Patience White, public health officer of the Arthritis Foundation, says cartilage regeneration isn\'t for everyone, especially not for obese people. ""I think it has tremendous potential,"" she says. ""But we don\'t know all the answers yet."" She recommends strengthening the muscles around the joint, losing weight and being sure you\'re ready for the exercise you want to do. THE PROCEDURE, AND THE PEOPLE IT MIGHT HELP THE PROCEDURE, AND THE PEOPLE IT MIGHT HELP People who need knee replacements can scratch this cartilage repair surgery off their list, says Riley Williams, a surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. ""If you have one, maybe two areas of isolated cartilage loss, then you are a candidate,"" says Williams. ""If you have it on one side of the knee, the meniscus is gone, and clearly the environment of the knee has shifted toward the degenerative, then we can\'t help with this kind of surgery."" ACI is a two-step process: Step 1: Healthy cartilage cells are taken from the knee using an arthroscopic tube. The cells are sent to a lab where they are cultured and multiply in about four to six weeks. Step 2: This requires a larger incision. A layer of tissue is sewn over the damaged area. The new cells are injected under the patch, where they will regenerate cartilage with surrounding cartilage. Dara Torres says life was ""kind of depressing"" — and she is not one to be depressed. A year ago, the Olympic swimmer could not walk up stairs without limping or pick up her baby girl because her knee hurt so much. Now, after undergoing a highly specialized surgery, Torres is picking up her toddler and her training for the 2012 London Olympics. She became the first U.S. swimmer to compete in five Olympics, winning three silver medals at the 2008 Beijing Games at age 41. ""When you train like this at my age, it takes its toll on your body,"" she says. Before Beijing, she had left knee pain, and afterward, it got much worse. A series of X-rays taken during several months revealed quickly deteriorating cartilage. ""My doctor told me it was one of the worst knees he\'s ever seen."" She opted to delay knee replacement and instead had orthopedic surgeon Thomas Minas perform knee cartilage regeneration surgery on Oct. 20. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) requires two operations, followed by a lengthy recovery and physical therapy. Torres says it\'s the toughest rehab she has ever faced, but ""I was diligent about listening to the doctor (and) pacing myself."" For 12 to 18 months, the new cartilage cells need to heal and harden. Patients wear a leg brace and use crutches for several months. They can run after a year and pivot several months later. Exertion or twisting too early could cause irreversible damage. Torres\' knee ""was a mess,"" Minas says. ""Now she walks normally, climbs stairs and has no pain."" Minas, director of the Cartilage Repair Center at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Chestnut Hill, Mass., performed the first ACIs in the USA in 1995 and has done more than 600. He says his patients, average age 39, have had a 92% success rate. ""This will delay a small group of patients who need knee replacements,"" he says. ""But we will always need replacements, unless we find some ... breakthrough halting the progression of osteoarthritis."" Torres says she is on track for London and just started ""easing back into kicking."" She hopes to keep motivating others to pursue dreams, no matter what age: ""I hear people say what I\'m doing inspires them to do things they put off because of age or thought they couldn\'t do.""

"," Anecdote and expert opinion triumphed over science and good journalism in a story on the regeneration of knee cartilage in USA Today. 
The article focused on autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), an expensive procedure intended to regenerate articular cartilage in the knee involving two operations and an arduous 18-month rehabilitation process.
Unwarranted Assumption of Benefit
From start to finish, the article seemed to assume that ACI is a beneficial treatment. It examined the outcomes of ACI through the prism of a single patient, who is apparently making a good recovery 12 months after the procedure.
That the journalist chose to present the experiences of a celebrity—Olympic swimmer Dara Torres—only adds to the allure of this invasive therapy. But it is certainly open to question whether the experiences of a highly disciplined Olympic athlete are generalizable to other patients undergoing this treatment.
The article offered a misleading statistic from Torres’ surgeon, who stated that 92% of his more than 600 patients have had “success” with ACI.
Yet the USA Today story never defined the indications for surgery in these patients— or what “success” meant.
No Mention of Scientific Evidence
In an era of evidence-based journalism, the article went astray in never citing a single scientific study or attempting to quantify the expected benefit of ACI.
It didn’t specify the availability or costs (an estimated $20-$35K) of this procedure. It didn’t address specific treatment alternatives for cartilage damage.
It didn’t discuss the possibility of adverse effects related to ACI. Yet in some studies, up to 50% of patients who opted for ACI have had to undergo an additional surgical procedure for cartilage problems down the road. (Genzyme, Highlights of Prescribing Information, Genzyme.com)
Two outside experts did offer some tempering remarks but didn’t actually question the effectiveness of ACI. And like the other contributors to this article, they didn’t cite a single scientific study.
What Does the Scientific Evidence Say?
A few sentences on the scientific evidence base for ACI would have brought the entire article into focus—and provided a real benefit for individuals considering this procedure.
And what does that evidence show? The most recent systematic review found evidence that ACI can provide benefit over the short-to-intermediate term. So its long-term effectiveness hasn’t been established. (Harris JD et al., AACI: Systematic Review, JBJS, Sept 15, 2010)
It is not clear if ACI is superior to many other common treatments for pain and dysfunction related to articular cartilage damage. Well-designed randomized trials comparing ACI to usual care would be valuable. 
So in short, while the evidence on ACI is promising, the jury is still out. This observation should have been the starting point for the USA Today article.

It\'s being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states.\n\n""I put it on my phone yesterday,"" said DeMont\'s wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. ""He would not be here as we see him today.""\n\nSeattle officials hope DeMont\'s story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it.\n\nDeveloped by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city\'s 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator.\n\nAbout 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events.\n\nHe came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant.\n\n""The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,"" Price said. ""The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.""\n\nIt occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said.\n\nIt\'s not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient\'s outcome.\n\nMadeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she\'d ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions.\n\nForcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over.\n\n""I hadn\'t responded to a cardiac arrest before,"" Forcade said. ""I thought, \'Did he just fall?\' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, \'Oh, man, who\'s going to step up?\'""\n\nHe told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said.\n\nFor DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — ""You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected"" — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference.\n\n""There\'s hope,"" DeMont said.\n\nHe\'s due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday.

Based on the study results, the intervention is promising for people in the initial stages of adjustment to any serious chronic illness.\n\nThe paper was published recently in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.\n\nThe HIV study is part of a larger body of positive affect research being conducted by Moskowitz. She also is studying the health effects of teaching the skills to individuals with type 2 diabetes, women with metastatic breast cancer and caregivers of dementia patients.\n\nFor the HIV study, which was based in San Francisco, 80 participants (primarily men) were taught a set of eight skills over five weekly sessions to help them experience more positive emotions. Another 79 participants were in the control group.\n\nMoskowitz and colleagues designed the tools based on evidence showing these particular skills increase positive emotions. Some of the skills included:\n\n1) Recognizing a positive event each day\n\n2) Savoring that positive event and logging it in a journal or telling someone about it\n\n3) Starting a daily gratitude journal\n\n4) Listing a personal strength each day and noting how you used this strength recently\n\n5) Setting an attainable goal each day and noting your progress\n\n6) Reporting a relatively minor stressor each day, then listing ways in which the event can be positively reappraised. This can lead to increased positive affect in the face of stress\n\n7) Understanding small acts of kindness can have a big impact on positive emotion and practicing a small act of kindness each day\n\n8) Practicing mindfulness with a daily 10-minute breathing exercise, concentrating on the breath\n\nFifteen months after the interventions, 91 percent of the intervention group had a suppressed viral load compared to 76 percent of the control group. In addition to the potential benefit of a lower viral load on the infected person, there may be public health benefits.\n\n""From a public health perspective, that is potentially huge for prevention of HIV,"" Moskowitz said. ""HIV is less likely to be transmitted with a low viral load. To have a difference like that is amazing.""\n\nThe reduced viral load could be because of a stronger immune system, Moskowitz said. Observational studies in people living with HIV have shown positive emotion is related to a higher CD4 count (an indicator of less HIV-related damage to the immune system). Or, the reduced viral load may be the result of participants\' better adherence to their antiretroviral drug therapy, which generally leads to a suppressed or undetectable viral load, Moskowitz said.\n\nThe positive emotion intervention also improved mental health. At baseline, about 17 percent of the control group and intervention group reported being on antidepressants. Fifteen month later, the intervention group was still at 17 percent but the control group\'s antidepressant use rose to 35 percent.\n\n""The group that learned coping skills did not increase antidepressant use, whereas overall the control group increased its antidepressant use,"" Moskowitz said. In addition, the intervention group was significantly less likely to have repeating, intrusive thoughts about HIV.\n\n###\n\nOther Northwestern authors include Elaine O. Cheung, Lizet Martinez and Eisuke Segawa.\n\nThe research was supported by grants R01 MH084723 and K24 MH093225 from the National Institute of Mental Health and grant P30 AI117943 from the Third Coast Center for AIDS Research, all of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMore News at Northwestern Now']",There are lessons to be learned from this small study. We wish the release had included more numbers and caveats from the published article.,"In a study by Northwestern University, 80 patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection were given training in thinking positively and compared to a control group of 79 who did not receive the training. Measures of viral load — more than a year later — were lower in the group who received the five-week intervention than those who did not.
To its credit, the release explains that the difference could be due to stronger adherence to anti-retroviral drug therapy in the group that received training in positive thinking and that’s what led to the decreased viral load.   
The release headline about “teaching happiness” seems to both exaggerate and oversimplify the science of psychological intervention. We wish the release had provided more numbers illustrating the benefits, and we question the researcher’s quote calling the results “amazing.”

The program runs on a smartphone, which records the sessions.\n\nWhen the device\'s camera detects an emotion such as happiness or sadness, Julian sees the word ""happy"" or ""sad"" — or a corresponding ""emoji"" — flash on the glass display. The device also tests his ability to read facial expressions.\n\n""The autism glass program is meant to teach children with autism how to understand what a face is telling them.

While the story admits that these are very early results, the fact they are framed in such positive terms is a bit disconcerting and might be setting up false hope for families with children on the autism spectrum.
Even though autism advocates are “excited that researchers are developing technologies to help” these children, it might be worth waiting until there are more details of the effectiveness of the wearable technology before announcing it with such enthusiasm to the general public.

IF YOU SUSPECT A STROKE IF YOU SUSPECT A STROKE If you believe someone has had a stroke, call 911 immediately. Remember to act FAST: F = Face\n\n• Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop? A = Arms\n\n• Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward? S = Speech\n\n• Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Are the words slurred? Can the person repeat the sentence correctly? T = Time\n\n• If the person shows any of these symptoms, time is important. Call 911 or get to the hospital fast. Brain cells are dying. Source: National Stroke Association CHICAGO \x97 A major study out Monday promises to transform stroke prevention for millions of people with atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder that often sends blood clots swirling to the brain, researchers reported Monday. The study of 14,000 patients found that a new one-a-day pill, rivaroxaban, prevents strokes as effectively as the current mainstay of treatment, Coumadin, without the need for routine testing to monitor patients\' ability to make blood clots and avoid unwanted bleeding, says Robert Califf, of the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, N.C. Atrial fibrillation affects approximately 2.3 million people in the USA, and has been linked to a five-fold increase in the risk of lethal strokes. The reason: when a heart goes into atrial fibrillation, its upper chambers quiver rather than contract 60 to 90 times a minute as they\'re supposed to, moving blood through the heart and blood vessels. ""Any time blood sits, it clots,"" says heart rhythm expert Gordon Tomaselli of Johns Hopkins University. Blood clots that travel to the brain may cut off its blood supply, causing a deadly stroke, he says. Coumadin, which inhibits clotting, is so often linked to major bleeding that the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 asked its maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, to notify consumers with a black box warning, FDA\'s strongest safety alert. In addition, patients\' blood levels vary so much from week to week that they must be regularly tested to make sure the drug is inhibiting clots from forming enough to guard against strokes but not so much that patients begin to bleed, Tomaselli says. It may take ""nothing more than a change in someone\'s diet"" — eating more or less green leafy vegetables — to cause the blood levels to rise and fall, Tomaselli says. On Oct. 19, FDA approved another alternative to Coumadin, Boehringer Ingelheim\'s, Pradaxa, a drug that must be taken twice a day and comes in two doses because, at the higher dose, the drug may build up in people with weak kidneys, promoting bleeding. Pradaxa\'s study design wasn\'t as rigorous as rivaroxaban\'s, Califf says. In the rivaroxaban study, patients were divided up into two groups, of about 7,000 patients each. One group was given the experimental drug and the other given warfarin. Unlike the Pradaxa patients, Califf says, those taking rivaroxaban underwent sham monitoring so that neither they, nor their doctors, would know which drug they were on to eliminate any possibility of bias. The patients were unusually elderly for a clinical trial, with a median age of 73 years, and often had histories of previous illnesses. Fifty-five percent in both groups had suffered strokes, researchers reported at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association. The blood levels of patients in the Coumadin group rose and fell so much that they were only in the beneficial range 58% of the time. When the results were tallied, researchers found that the stroke and blood clot rates in both groups were similar, at about 2%. More rivaroxiban patients suffered surface bleeding and had higher transfusion rates, but Coumadin patients had more life-threatening bleeding into crticial organs, Califf says. Peter DiBattiste, of Johnson & Johnson, which developed the drug with Bayer, says the two companies will apply for FDA approval by the end of the year. Elaine Hylek of Boston University, an independent expert who analyzed the trial on behalf of AHA, says the availablity of alternatives for atrial fibrillation will make treatment available to stroke-prone people who can\'t take Coumadin because they don\'t have access to monitoring. Sidney Smith, of the cardiovascular science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said that the new drug is likely to be expensive, so ""we\'re left with a question of cost versus convenience.""

A recent evidence review of several alternatives to medication found that using cognitive behavioral therapy as the first treatment for depression can be equally effective as using a second generation antidepressant.\n\nThe research from the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center was published today in the British Medical Journal. The authors focused specifically on comparing second generation antidepressants, such as Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Prozac with cognitive behavioral therapy, which includes several in-person or phone sessions with a therapist to examine how actions and thoughts can impact depression. Second-generation antidepressants refers to newer antidepressants introduced primarily in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n""Major depressive disorder is a disabling and prevalent form of depression, experienced by more than 16 percent of U.S. adults during their lifetime,"" said Arlene Bierman, M.D., Director, Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement, at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which funded the study. ""Most patients will be prescribed antidepressants. However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options.""\n\nAfter conducting a full review of the scientific literature available, the researchers examined 11 randomized controlled trials with 1,511 patients that compared a second generation antidepressant with cognitive behavioral therapy. They found that symptom improvement and rate of remission were similar between the two options, whether used alone or in combination with each other.\n\n""Primary care clinicians and their patients may not automatically consider alternatives when discussing treatment,"" said Halle Amick, research associate at the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author. ""Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies.""\n\nSide effects from antidepressants can include constipation, diarrhea and dizziness. Patients also sometimes express concerns about becoming addicted to medications and therefore prefer psychotherapy. However, psychotherapy can be time-consuming and may be substantially more expensive, depending on the patient\'s insurance benefits.\n\n""Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients. Such shared and informed decision making might enhance treatment adherence which is one of the main challenges of treating major depressive disorder,"" said Gerald Gartlehner, M.D., associate director of the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center, who was the principal investigator of the evidence review, which was also published today by AHRQ.\n\nA journal article describing all the review findings will be published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in January.\n\n""Bringing psychotherapy into discussions of treatment may also enhance coordination of care between primary care and mental health care providers in addition to addressing the issue of patient-centered care,"" Amick said. ""If primary care providers discuss psychotherapy with their patients as a valid treatment option, it may empower patients to voice their preferences and truly participate in medical decision-making and encourage them to adopt and adhere to effective treatment of their depression.""\n\nRTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center is a collaboration between RTI and the five health professions schools and the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at UNC. It is funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n\nSEE ORIGINAL STUDY']","Psychotherapy is “just as effective” as antidepressants, according to this release, but how effective is that?","This news release from RTI International states that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and second generation antidepressants are equally effective as first-line treatments for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). CBT is a general term for a wide variety of psychotherapy strategies that involve talking about one’s thoughts, feelings and behaviors in order to make positive changes. Second generation antidepressants refer to drugs introduced in the 1980s and 1990s and include the brand name drugs Prozac, Lexapro and Wellbutrin. The findings reported come from a mega-analysis of 11 previous randomized controlled studies that looked at CBT and antidepressant outcomes. The claim that they are equally effective as first-line treatments for MDD conflict with current practice guidelines recommended by the American Psychiatric Association and the British Association for Psychopharmacology that state, “psychotherapy is sufficient for treating mild depression, antidepressant medications (ADMs) should be used to treat severe depression in the context of major depressive disorder.” The news release’s claims about benefits aren’t backed up by hard numbers showing what the study authors found.

The largest study comprised approximately 230,000 Finnish women and the follow-up time in different studies was up to 20 years.\n\nMenopause may explain women\'s higher dementia risk\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is the most common cause of dementia, and two out of three Alzheimer\'s cases are women. One possible explanation for women\'s higher dementia risk is the postmenopausal depletion of sex steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen receptors are present throughout the body including brain areas primarily affected in Alzheimer\'s disease. In in vitro and animal studies, estrogen has showed neuroprotective effects. However, studies on humans have yielded inconsistent results on the association between postmenopausal estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy and dementia risk.\n\nHormonal therapy may protect cognition if started at the onset of menopause\n\nIn the present study, long-term use of hormonal replacement therapy was associated with a better performance in certain cognitive domains - global cognition and episodic memory - and a lower risk of Alzheimer\'s disease. Short-term use was not significantly linked to dementia risk, but in one cohort, dementia risk was higher among short-term users who had started hormone therapy in the late postmenopausal period. The results were adjusted for various lifestyle, socioeconomic and demographic variables.\n\n""In the light of these findings, hormonal replacement therapy may have a beneficial effect on cognition if started early, around the time of menopause. The protective effect of hormonal therapy may depend on the health status of neurons at baseline and may be lost if therapy starts years after menopause,"" Dr Imtiaz concludes.\n\nThe study also showed that the postmenopausal removal of ovaries, uterus or both was not significantly linked to the risk of Alzheimer\'s disease, irrespective of the indication of surgery or hormone therapy use.\n\nThe research data was from the MEDALZ (Medication use and Alzheimer\'s disease), OSTPRE (Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention Study) and CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) studies.

Sure, I talk to my students about personal responsibility, but when it comes to the health of populations, I look for big fixes more than for small acts of will.\n\nThat’s why my ears perked up when I heard that two old physician friends had decided to start taking, as a preventive measure, some of the medications often included in what the field has dubbed the “polypill.” My friends are both top doctors in their 60s, with good diet and lifestyle, and this is now part of their personal health regimen.\n\nA polypill might include any of several things: a baby aspirin, a statin to rebalance cholesterol, a drug to control blood pressure and one to lower blood sugar. (A version less comprehensive than this is available online with a doctor’s prescription at Polypill.com.) Whatever the combination, the doses are low, so it’s relatively safe. It’s like a multivitamin, but with serious medications. Some public-health advocates now argue that everyone over 50 should be on one.\n\nYou read that right: everyone. If we had perfectly healthy lifestyles, these drugs would not be needed, but we don’t. And even if we did, the drugs might add further protection.\n\nOne review of the research on polypills comes from Melvin Lafeber and his colleagues at the University Medical Center Utrecht (Netherlands). Writing in Current Hypertension Reports in April, they found reason to think that treatment might help higher-risk individuals and urged more clinical trials. If moderate- and high-risk people benefit, “the idea of offering treatment to everybody older than 50 years might raise widespread interest,” they wrote. The polypill, they concluded, “could be an important tool to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease” and make it more likely that patients take the necessary drugs.\n\nCritics worry about medicalizing whole populations, predicting that the pill would encourage bad habits and worsen health disparities. A fixed-dose combination pill is one-size-fits-all, which doctors don’t usually regard as the best medicine. But polypills might solve real problems. The drugs in them are cheap and target illnesses that afflict many millions around the world, and even patients with tailored prescriptions often fail to keep up with the various medicines.\n\nSome of the component drugs are now being evaluated for use with lower-risk populations—that is, people who don’t already have serious problems with their blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol. Though not a polypill experiment per se, a study published in May in the New England Journal of Medicine involved 12,000 people over five years. One group got two drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, the other got placebos. In the group taking both drugs, 3.6% died or had health crises; in the placebo group, 5% did. The doses were low, so the adverse effects were modest.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that we should all be on the polypill, but some sensible experts, including my two doctor friends, are moving toward this sort of preventive approach for people who aren’t ill or at high risk. After all, many of us are already taking low-dose aspirin, which is possibly the riskiest of these drugs.\n\nI tend to favor this sort of blunt, comprehensive approach to public health. Much as I like menacing cigarette-package warnings, urging personal responsibility, I like cigarette taxes more (despite their regressive impact). I love “Drive Carefully” signs, but I like seat belts better. And I like air bags best: No judgment, no decision, no defiant will. As for driving under the influence, breathalyzer tests and taking keys away beat the heck out of admonitions to be sober and find a designated driver.\n\nHuman nature is not our ally in maintaining health. With heart disease and stroke, many millions of lives are at stake, and for me it comes down to this: Will popping a polypill work better than willpower? I suspect that the answer may turn out to be yes.']",While the notion is interesting–can a one-size-fits-all polypill help safely and effectively stave off diseases of aging–the story didn’t include enough for information for readers to understand the issue.,"This is a story about a physician’s viewpoint on a speculative drug known as a “polypill”  to battle “heart disease, diabetes and other illnesses all at the same time.” This pill would be used in a preventive way among all healthy adults older than 50.
While the notion is interesting–can a one-size-fits-all polypill help safely and effectively stave off common diseases of aging–the story didn’t include enough information for readers to understand the issue. Evidence-wise, we don’t get a sense of if there are any clinical trial results examining the benefits of using a polypill among a healthy population of older adults. Important trade-offs like side effects are dismissed, and there’s very little indication of if or when such a pill might be available to a general population.

""But we don\'t have studies saying that they decrease the risk of death from prostate cancer.""\n\nA total of 8,231 men between the ages of 50 and 75 took part in the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAll of the men had elevated blood levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), which indicated an increased risk for prostate cancer. But none had evidence of cancer when biopsies were performed within six months of entering the trial.\n\nStudy researcher Gerald L. Andriole, MD, says a significant proportion of men screened for prostate cancer fall into this clinically ambiguous category of having elevated PSAs and negative biopsies.\n\n""We know from experience that many of these men are likely to have microscopic prostate tumors that were missed by their original biopsy,"" he says in a news release.\n\nThe men were assigned to receive either placebo treatments or daily 0.5-milligram doses of Avodart for four years. Scheduled biopsies were performed two and four years after they entered the trial.']","A fairly thorough review, covering costs, benefits (with a stab at absolute risk reduction), and harms.  Caveats and uncertainties were emphasized. ","This week in The New England Journal of Medicine is the second of two major studies showing a reduction in prostate cancer incidence from a drug in the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor class. The drug Avodart, commonly used to treat enlarged prostates, was shown to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer from 25% to 20% over 4 years in men with an elevated PSA but no prostate cancer on biopsy. With the results of this study, the drug maker, Glasko Smith Kline, is now seeking FDA approval for the drug for this indication. However, the results are far from a slam-dunk and the implications are controversial.
Adding to the contoversy are several factors: 1) no studies have shown a decrease in deaths from prostate cancer; 2) the side effects of the drug are significant (including a troubling finding of increased risk of heart failure); 3) lowering PSA levels is not necessarily of benefit; it just proves that the drug acts to shrink the prostate; and 4) the costs of the drug are huge – at $4 a day, it could cost up to $500,000 to prevent one case of prostate cancer (https://www.healthnewsreview.org/blog/2009/05/a-half-million.html).
This story does a nice job of describing the current study, quantifiying the benefits and discussing the controversy. It provides balance by quoting independent experts with no financial or personal interests in the results and by fully disclosing the potential harms of the drug.

Paleo has a devout following who swear by its protein-heavy meals, while intermittent fasters believe that forgoing food for hours on end (which varies, but can include skipping meals for an entire day), provides the best results. For those who just can’t give up grains (or regular eating), a new study indicates that being less restrictive is actually better for your waistline.\n\nRelated: How to Lose Weight and Keep it Off? Eternal Dieting Vigilance\n\nResearchers from The University of Tasmania in Australia found that breaking up with your diet for two weeks could lead to more weight loss—and help you keep it off, too.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nFor the small study just published in the International Journal of Obesity, the team enlisted 51 obese men from the ages of 25 to 54 years old. All participants had maintained their current weight for six months leading up to the study and did not exercise regularly. One group of men followed the diet, which reduced calorie consumption by about one-third of their individual needs, for 16 weeks straight. The experimental group stuck to the eating plan for two weeks, before ditching the diet for two weeks. They repeated the cycle until they had also dieted for 16 weeks; however, in their case, each bout of restriction was followed by a period of eating enough calories for weight maintenance.\n\nAt the end of the study, the men following the intermittent diet plan lost 47 percent more weight than the control group. And while it’s common to regain a few pounds after returning to previous eating habits, the two-week dieters kept the pounds off, maintaining a nearly 18-pound loss six months after the study.\n\nKrista Varady, an outside researcher who studies intermittent fasting (not the same as intermittent dieting) and weight loss at the University of Illinois, believes the results were significant.\n\n""I was really impressed that they still saw almost a two kilogram weight loss during that last period at the end of the four months,"" she tells Newsweek. ""At that point we see almost zero weight loss,"" she explains of her own research. ""Somehow they’re kind of keeping the body on its toes.""\n\nThis trick may help combat the dreaded weight loss plateau that plagues dieters looking to lose those last five pounds. As we cut calories and lose weight, our resting metabolic rate eventually slows and our bodies become less efficient at shedding mass in a process known as adaptive thermogenesis. While frustrating, it’s one of our natural survival mechanisms to prevent potential starvation.\n\nRelated: Obesity Crisis: Two Billion People Now Overweight and U.S. is One of the Fattest Nations on Earth\n\nAnother benefit from intermittent dieting? People who have a difficult time staying motivated may find relief by the two-week breaks. However, it’s important not to think of them as cheat days. The dieters ate enough calories to maintain their weight during the off period. But, Varady believes it’s probably safe to enjoy a slice of cake or bowl of ice cream during the break.\n\n""It seemed like they probably had a couple of cheat days here and there,"" she says of the data. ""Diets tend to work if you have a couple of cheat days during the month. Just as long as it doesn’t psychologically derail people.""\n\nThis story was updated to include analysis from weight loss researcher Krista Varady, PhD, a nutrition professor at the University of Illinois, Chicago.']","Diet studies are guaranteed instant news hooks, so it’s important that stories about them offer abundant context and detail.","This article describes a small and limited study (men only!) concluding that “intermittent” dieting that gives participants alternating cycles of two weeks of less restrictive weight-maintenance eating after two weeks of more restrictive calorie counts results in more weight loss over time.
The article properly notes the potential benefits of such a plan–better compliance and some possible metabolic assist that prevents dieting “plateaus” that frustrate so many trying to lose pounds. But while the article acknowledges the flaws in most trendy diets, it doesn’t offer readers enough specific information to determine whether this variation on the dietary theme will work for them any better than any other diet. For example, it doesn’t say what the two arms of the intermittent diet included in actual calorie counts and/or foods; what the starting and ending average weights were for the study group; or even how the researchers kept track of what the participants were actually eating or doing other than (presumably) weighing them every two weeks.

story_reviews_00472,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/cbs-report-needed-more-details-on-stem-cell-surgery-study/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,First-of-its-kind cataract surgery using stem cells shows promise,"['A new form of cataract surgery using a patient\'s stem cells has restored vision in babies for the first time, and someday the technique may hold promise for millions of older Americans who undergo traditional cataract eye surgery every year, say scientists who developed the new procedure.\n\nEye experts across the country who spoke with CBS News are alternately excited and cautious about the findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nThe procedure, developed by researchers at the University of California San Diego and China, is less invasive than traditional cataract treatment, said the scientists.\n\nCataracts are most common in older adults. As most people age, an opaque film slowly forms over the lens -- the part of the eye that helps with focusing on images at various distances. It clouds vision and can lead to blindness.\n\nIn cataract surgery, which has been around for several decades, eye surgeons make an incision in the front of the eye and remove the lens from its supporting capsule. Then they replace it with an artificial lens.\n\nThe new procedure described in Nature involves making a slim incision at the side of the lens capsule, removing the entire lens, yet preserving the empty capsule bag or ""scaffold."" A certain kind of stem cell, called endogenous stem/progenitor cells, when left intact, then begins to repopulate the damaged lens and essentially grow a new, healthy lens.\n\nStudy author Dr. Kang Zhang, the chief of ophthalmic genetics at UC San Diego\'s Shiley Eye Institute, told CBS News, ""Unlike [the] current way of cataract surgery, which destroys over half of lens stem cells and requires implantation of a plastic intranet ocular lens, we devised a new surgery to make a very small opening at the side of a cataractous lens bag, remove [the] cataract inside, allow the opening to heal, and promote dormant lens stem cells to regrow an entirely new lens with vision.""\n\nPioneering surgery tested in babies\n\nThe experimental procedure was done in 12 infants who were born with a congenital cataract condition.\n\nBy using a less invasive procedure, Zhang and his colleagues report that they were able to leave the lens epithelial stem cells, also called LECs, intact. These LECs regenerated the eye\'s lens in the children, eliminating the need for implants. The same technique was also successfully performed in animals.\n\nIn little ones with congenital cataracts, eye surgeons need to intervene early so that light can get to the brain and allow for normal, healthy growth, said Suraj Bhat, associate professor of ophthalmology and director of the Vision Molecular Biology Laboratory at the UCLA Stein Eye Institute. Bhat was not involved in the new research, but said it\'s ""extremely exciting"" because it offers an alternative to ""an extraordinarily invasive"" procedure.\n\n""In early childhood cataracts are very bad. We need light to enter into the eyes at a young age to get proper brain function, otherwise, information does not get transferred to the developing brain,"" said Bhat.\n\nArtificial irises let people see in a different light\n\nTraditional surgery can cause opacity in the line of a child\'s vision and, because the eye is still growing, it is difficult to provide good vision with eye glasses, explained Julie T. Daniels, from University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, in an accompanying commentary in Nature.\n\nMany children also later go on to suffer from glaucoma.\n\nDaniels wrote that to correctly refract light onto the retina at the back of the eye, the cornea and lens must remain transparent throughout life. Current treatments for the cornea and lens involve donor transplants or artificial implants, but the procedures can be risky. She said the new procedure, which coaxes stem cells to regenerate normal tissue in the body, offers promise.\n\n""The study\'s stem cell engineering has led to the regeneration of transparent lens tissue in children, showing that the concept offers a potential therapeutic approach,"" Daniels wrote.\n\nShe noted a second study in Nature that used transplant tissue grown in the laboratory from stem cells to treat damaged corneas, saying it also holds promise.\n\nZhang said their results need to be validated in a large number of patients ""and with a longer follow-up period.""\n\nWill it work in older eyes?\n\nOne major question remains to be answered: Can it be applied to age-related cataracts, the leading cause of blindness?\n\nAccording to the National Eye Institute, about 24.4 million Americans suffer from cataracts. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of cataract cases in the U.S. went up by 20 percent, and it\'s expected to continue to grow as the population ages.\n\n""We are now planning a study to test this approach in this old patient population. In addition, we are testing if this approach can be used in treating other leading causes of blindness, such as macular degeneration and glaucoma,"" said Zhang.\n\nHe hopes the surgery will be available to the general population within four to five years.\n\n""I would anticipate that it may be available after several independent studies with a large number of patients,"" he said.\n\nSome other experts in the field saw great promise in the research.\n\n""Everyone\'s working on this. Stem cells are like the Holy Grail of vision research,"" Dr. James Tsai, M.D., president of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, told CBS News. ""To me, it\'s very exciting data. They may be on to something.""\n\nBut he tempered the hope the study offers by noting that the lens regeneration work is also ""very controversial"" and could impact a multimillion-dollar industry.\n\n""This is potentially a new surgery. If you think about the implications in the long run, lens implants may not be necessary,"" he said. ""There are a lot of doctors who will want to see more data.""\n\nHe also pointed out that the study involved infants, and that adults -- the most common cataract patients -- have a different regenerative capacity of lens epithelial stem cells.\n\nIn the meantime, Tsai said it\'s hopeful news for some babies with congenital cataracts like the children who participated in the study. ""As a glaucoma specialist, the way we do congenital cataracts, there\'s a great risk these babies will develop glaucoma for a lifetime and maybe with this new surgery, they won\'t have that glaucoma risk.""\n\nDr. Maria Valeria Canto-Soler, assistant professor of ophthalmology and director of the Retinal Degeneration Research Center at Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, said she was impressed by the research.\n\n""The main excitement for me is the ability to regenerate an organ or a tissue within an organ,"" said Canto-Soler, a retina specialist.\n\n""From what I know, I\'d say this is the first demonstration where you can use endogenous stem cells for replacing tissue within the eye. It\'s something we are all looking for. They have actually done it in humans.""\n\nShe said, even without answers to the question of whether it will work in aging eyes, it creates hope for children with congenital issues. ""If you can create it in children, that\'s a big thing. You are giving sight back to little kids and that change their lives.""\n\nLarger studies, ""more eyes"" needed\n\nDr. Kathryn Hatch, an ophthalmologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston, told CBS News the procedure ""seems very exciting,"" but more research is needed.\n\n""I\'d need to see a larger study with more eyes, and we need to see some reproducibility, and see how long it would take for the lens -- if it\'s able to regenerate -- what are the visual results. Because that\'s what patients really care about. Their vision. If it takes months to get to an outcome, it\'s not superior to the lens technologies we have now. I\'m not sure what the advantage is. Most patients don\'t even want to wait. They want to get back to work, their life,"" Hatch added.\n\nShe also had questions about how the procedure was done with such a tiny incision. ""I don\'t understand how they\'re doing the surgery with such a tiny hole without tearing the capsule. If we make a three millimeter incision [in traditional cataract surgery], that\'s really small in an adult.""\n\nCataract surgery is ""traditionally done by hand with a bent needle. That\'s one of the most difficult steps to learn as a surgeon. One of most important steps to learn,"" she said and there could be major eye damage if a surgery was compromised by a tear.\n\nShe also noted that baby eye surgery is different from adults in that the infant cataract is much softer compared to an adult\'s harder cataract.\n\nUCLA\'s Bhat noted another limitation in the study: ""These are all genetic cataracts. This study wasn\'t long enough. They [cataracts] may come back,"" he said, but it\'s also possible the genetic defect may not reappear.\n\nHe\'s said it\'s unclear if the results will be mirrored in older cataract patients, the same concern expressed by others in the field.\n\n""Cell division is slower in older people,"" Bhat said. ""The biggest problem as we grow older, particularly beyond 50, is cell division which keeps on decreasing. Our ability to make new cells is significantly lost. The process that these people are depending upon is tremendously dependent on cell division.""\n\nBhat said he also paused when he read the statement in the paper that claimed a 100 percent success rate three months after surgery.\n\n""I don\'t know them. I can\'t second guess them. You\'ve got to believe the written word.""']","This story had a lot going for it–including a multitude of independent sources–but it would have been stronger if it had better quantified the results of the study, and explained how the researchers measured the success of this new surgical method.","This story describes the findings of a study published in Nature that involved a new approach to correcting congenital cataracts in infants using the patient’s own stem cells to grow new lenses in the eye, versus the more standard approach of using artificial lenses.he story had a lot going for it compared with some less thorough competing stories (see here and here), especially when discussing important caveats about the study’s limitations. However, the piece would have been stronger if it had better quantified the results of the study: How did the researchers measure the success of this approach? We also wanted to see more information about the study design itself: How many patients were studied? And for how long? Finally, the story quickly turned to examining whether this approach might be used among older adults who have conventional cataracts–even though congenital cataracts are a very different disease process, and the current study applied to infants only.

Men also had a risk reduction from frequently eating berries.\n\n""For total flavonoids, the beneficial result was only in men. But, berries are protective in both men and women,"" said the study\'s lead author, Dr. Xiang Gao, a research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health and an associate epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston.\n\n""Berries could be a neuroprotective agent. People can include berries in their regular diet. There are no harmful effects from berry consumption, and they lower the risk of hypertension too,"" Gao added.\n\nResults of the study are published online April 4 in the journal Neurology.\n\nParkinson\'s disease is a degenerative condition that affects the central nervous system. It causes movement disorders, such as tremors, rigidity and balance problems. About 500,000 Americans have Parkinson\'s disease, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\n\nFlavonoids are substances found in plant foods that help prevent damage to the body\'s cells, known as oxidative damage. Anthocyanins are a type of flavonoid plentiful in such berries as strawberries and blueberries.\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed nutrition and health data from almost 50,000 men enrolled in the Health Professional Follow-Up Study and more than 80,000 women participating in the Nurses\' Health Study.\n\nThe researchers looked at dietary intake of five major flavonoid sources: tea, berries, apples, orange juice and red wine.\n\nOver 20 to 22 years of follow-up, 805 people developed Parkinson\'s disease -- 438 men and 367 women.\n\nWhen researchers compared those who ate the most flavonoids with those who ate the least, they found that only men saw a statistically significant benefit, lowering their risk of Parkinson\'s by 40 percent.\n\nGao said it wasn\'t clear why only men benefited from the extra flavonoid intake, but he noted that other studies have also found differences between men and women. Gao said it\'s not clear if there\'s a biological mechanism causing these differences, or another factor.\n\nBut, when the researchers looked at the dietary compounds individually, it was clear that berries could benefit both men and women, lowering the risk of Parkinson\'s disease by about 25 percent for those who had at least two servings of berries a week.\n\nGao said that anthocyanins protect the cells from oxidative damage and they also have an anti-inflammatory effect, which may be how berries help to reduce Parkinson\'s risk.\n\nThe study findings should be interpreted cautiously because the participants were mostly white professionals, and the results might not apply to other ethnic groups. Also, recollections of dietary intake may be faulty, and it\'s possible that other properties of fruits and vegetables might have influenced the results, the authors said.\n\nDr. Michael Okun, medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation, said, ""It is exciting to see research emerging about modifiable dietary issues that may affect the risk of getting diseases such as Parkinson\'s.""\n\nBut, he added, it\'s important for people to realize that this research isn\'t applicable to people who already have the disease.\n\nHe also said it will be important to confirm these findings in other studies and learn the mechanism of how berries and other flavonoids appear to offer some protection against Parkinson\'s disease.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about Parkinson\'s disease from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.']",Inaccurate language to describe an observational study was the main problem in this story about how certain foods may affect the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.,"Here’s what we thought could have been handled better:

story_reviews_01129,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3818/,2011-04-12 04:00:00,Screening Prostates at Any Age,"[""The new study only included national data through 2005, the most recent year they were available, but, said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colorectal cancers for the American Cancer Society, “there is no reason to believe it has changed significantly since 2005.” Doctors said there are several reasons screening seems to continue indefinitely as men age. They range from patient demands to malpractice fears to financial incentives and doctors’ own lack of understanding of the risks and benefits of screening.\n\n“There are a lot of pressures,“ said Dr. Gerald L. Andriole, a urologic surgeon at Washington University. “It is not all pure data that is promoting aggressive screening.” Dr. Andriole is directing a National Cancer Institute study of 76,000 men that failed to find a screening benefit after 10 years. The men were aged 55 to 74 when the study began. P.S.A. screening is controversial at any age. Screening proponents say the cancer institute study was flawed and point to a European study of 162,000 men aged 55 to 69 that showed a 20 percent drop in the prostate cancer death rate with screening.\n\nScreening critics say the European study was flawed and add that there is a logical reason it has been hard to show a screening benefit.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey note that prostate cancer is a common cancer, found in most men’s prostates on autopsy, although often the men had no idea they had it. The cancer can be lethal, but it usually grows so slowly that men die with it, not because of it.\n\nFor most men, screening only has harms because it leads to biopsies and treatments with unpleasant side effects. And, they say, it might not help cure many deadly prostate cancers because those cancers may have already spread outside the prostate, microscopically seeding other organs, long before a P.S.A. test indicates a possible problem.\n\nA positive P.S.A. test usually leads to a biopsy and then, if cancer is found, to a decision about whether to treat it. Nearly all men opt for treatment, which includes surgery to remove the prostate or radiation to destroy the cancer. Side effects can include impotence and incontinence.\n\nEven younger men should weigh the harms of screening, says Dr. Lisa Schwartz of Dartmouth Medical School. “You also have the potential to wreck their lives,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne reason treatment is the most common choice is that it is hard to know if a cancer is lethal. Pathologists can distinguish between cancers that look particularly aggressive and those that do not, but there is a real possibility that even if tissue obtained at a biopsy has only less aggressive tumor cells, more aggressive cells might still be lurking in the prostate.\n\nBut even with this uncertainty, prostate cancer specialists say, most men who are treated would not have died of prostate cancer, and that is especially true for elderly men, in particular those who are frail and have a limited life expectancy. Yet changing medical practice can be difficult.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

And doctors, he added, have many inducements to screen. They often are afraid they could be sued if they do not screen and a man is found to have a lethal cancer. And there are financial incentives.\n\n“Urologists make money by finding ways to biopsy men and administer treatments,” Dr. Andriole said. Screening, he added, “is promoted by hospitals and industry.” And, he added, “many patients demand it.”\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Brooks of the cancer society says he travels the country and talks to primary care doctors about screening, and has learned that many have misconceptions about the test’s benefits.\n\n“They often don’t appreciate the downside of screening,” Dr. Brooks said, “and they don’t appreciate the delay in benefit.” In addition, Dr. Brooks said, primary care doctors often “overestimate the likelihood that early detection of prostate cancer will lead to survival benefits.”\n\nAdded to that, Dr. Brooks said, is the length of time it takes to discuss the pros and cons of screening with patients. Often it is easier to just order the test.\n\nDr. Bruce Roth, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, said that ideally, a doctor should take a man’s overall health into account and not just go by age in ordering P.S.A. tests.

And other studies already underway may soon offer patients even more options, researchers say.\n\nPatients taking Folfirinox, a novel combination of four drugs already approved to fight other cancers, lived 11.1 months — 4.3 months longer than those given standard chemo, according to a French study of 342 patients in today\'s New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThat might not seem like a lot of time in any other disease.\n\nBut study author Thierry Conroy notes that pancreatic cancer is especially lethal, typically killing patients in only about 6 months. Patients diagnosed with the disease have so few options that the Food and Drug Administration approved a drug called Tarceva to treat pancreatic cancer in 2005, even though that drug improved survival by only about 2 weeks.\n\nAlthough Folfirinox caused more serious side effects than standard chemo, patients still rated their quality of life higher, Conroy says. That may be because Folfirinox prevented their tumors from causing serious side effects, such as pain, loss of appetite and weight loss.\n\nDoctors are already changing their practice based on the study, which was presented at a medical meeting last year, says cancer specialist Gauri Varadhachary of Houston\'s M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, who wasn\'t involved in the new study.\n\n""This is great news for our patients,"" Varadhachary says.

The other option is minimally invasive hair transplant surgery. In the U.S., there are around 50 million men and 30 million women affected by hair loss, which U.K.-based researchers said could be the source of “psychological distress.”\n\nIn a study conducted on human hair follicles, researchers investigated a drug called Cyclosporine A (CsA), which has been prescribed to treat immune disorders and transplant rejection since the 1980s. Side effects including shaking, headaches, vomiting and swollen gums—as well as unwanted hair growth.\n\nREUTERS/Peter Macdiarmid\n\nThe research team, lead by Dr. Nathan Hawkshaw at the University of Manchester, investigated whether CsA could provide some clues for treating baldness.\n\nAfter treating hair with CsA, the scientists analyzed the gene expressions of isolated human scalp hair follicles. They found that CsA changed how the follicles expressed a protein called SFRP1, which stunts the development and growth of hair follicles and other tissues in the body.\n\nThe scientists were then able to identify that WAY-316606, a compound used to treat osteoporosis, has a similar effect on how SFRP1 is expressed.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe compound WAY-316606 could therefore be used to treat baldness, without patients suffering the same side effects as they would on CsA. The study was published in the journal PLOS Biology.\n\nDr. Hawkshaw said in a statement: “The fact this new agent, which had never even been considered in a hair-loss context, promotes human hair growth is exciting because of its translational potential: it could one day make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss.”\n\n“Clearly though, a clinical trial is required next to tell us whether this drug or similar compounds are both effective and safe in hair-loss patients.”\n\nA British Association of Dermatologists spokesperson said in a statement the results were interesting.\n\n“For individuals with hair loss, treatments can be very hit and miss, there isn’t one which is universally effective. For that reason new treatments are exciting as they give people more treatment options that may be effective.\n\n“This research has been tested on human tissue, which is promising, but not on humans themselves, so there is still some way to go.\n\n“It is also important to realise that this is being proposed as a treatment for hair loss, not a cure as such.”\n\nThis piece has been updated with a comment from the British Assocation of Dermatologists.']",The evidence is so scant that readers aren’t likely to get much use out of this story.,"This news story hyped lab findings as evidence that a potential “cure” for baldness could be on the horizon. Researchers at the University of Manchester in the U.K. found that a substance called Cyclosporine A (CsA), which has been used to treat immune disorders and transplant rejection, affected a protein that stunts the development of hair follicles. They then identified an osteoporosis drug called WAY-316606 that has a similar effect on hair follicles in the lab, but could potentially have fewer side effects than CsA.

But the therapy worked vastly better than University of Pennsylvania researchers David L. Porter, MD, Carl H. June, MD, and colleagues had dared to hope.\n\n""Our results were absolutely dramatic. It is tremendously exciting,"" Porter tells WebMD. ""These kinds of outcomes don\'t come around very often. We are really hopeful that we can now translate this into treatment for much larger numbers of patients and apply this technique to other diseases and to many more patients.""\n\nExcitement is spreading as oncologists learn about the findings.

Moreover, the signal does not call down the deadly all-out immune attack -- the feared ""cytokine storm"" -- that can do more harm than good.\n\nThis may be why relatively small infusions of the CAR T cells had such a profound effect.

Check the data,"[""NEW YORK (Reuters Health) — Could one hour be all you need to quit smoking, without cravings or side effects?\n\nA woman has an unlit cigarette in her mouth in New York City, September 15, 2010. REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nThat’s what Innovative Laser Therapy, a New Haven, Connecticut-based company, advertises on its website. The clinic uses low-level lasers - similar to those sometimes used to treat arthritis-related pain - to target specific acupuncture points on the body related to addiction, metabolism and stress, and claims that most patients can quit smoking after one session.\n\nIn that session, the laser is pointed at spots on the face, hands and wrist, with the aim of relieving withdrawal symptoms and preventing cravings.\n\n“When you smoke a cigarette, you artificially tell your brain to release endorphins,” Frank Pinto, the owner of Innovative Laser Therapy, told Reuters Health. Therefore, quitting leads to a quick drop in endorphin levels, he said.\n\n“The laser basically stimulates the nerve endings to tell the brain to release a flood of endorphins” to boost a patient over that initial 3-5 day hump of withdrawal symptoms, he said.\n\nThe treatment also targets other points that are thought to suppress appetite — to prevent the weight gain that often comes with quitting smoking — and promote relaxation, according to Innovative Laser Therapy.\n\nBut does it work?\n\n‘NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE’ IN SCIENTIFIC TERMS\n\nThere's limited research showing that laser therapy might help some smokers quit. Innovative Laser Therapy cites one study, a 2008 paper published in the Journal of Chinese Medicine, available on their site at link.reuters.com/pus95p. A UK-based team found that smokers that had four laser treatments over two weeks were more likely to quit than smokers that had three treatments. Those in the three treatment group, in turn, had better success rates than a control group that was given fake laser treatments.\n\nAfter 6 months, 55 percent of the four-treatment group was smoke-free, compared to 19 percent of the three-treatment group and 6 percent of those who were treated with fake lasers.\n\nThe authors weren’t able to follow most of the 340 participants for more than 6 months after treatment, so they don’t know if those who stopped smoking started up again, or if they really quit for good. And the journal’s site - which offers lasers and other treatments for sale — does not say whether it is peer-reviewed.\n\nIn contrast, a 2000 Singapore study of 330 adolescents found no difference in 3-month quitting rates for participants treated with real or fake laser therapy.\n\n“In scientific terms, this one (UK) study is not enough evidence to recommend (the) laser for smoking cessation,” Dr. Adrian White told Reuters Health by email. Dr. White is a research fellow at Peninsula Medical School in the UK who co-authored a review of laser therapy and similar smoking cessation methods for the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. “The results conflict with the other study, and they seem ‘too good to be true.’”\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 Americans is a current cigarette smoker, and the majority of them smoke every day. The American Heart Association reports that more than 80 percent of smokers say they want to quit. But many smokers try more than one smoking cessation method or take years of trying before they do quit for good.\n\nPinto launched Innovative Laser Therapy after he successfully quit smoking with a round of laser therapy from a clinic in Florida. His company charges $350 for a one-time treatment that takes less than an hour, and offers free extra treatments to patients who are still struggling with quitting in the following 6 months. Other companies do a few shorter therapy sessions as part of their regular treatment plan.\n\nNOT FDA-APPROVED FOR QUITTING SMOKING\n\nUsing acupuncture methods to treat addictions such as smoking is not new, White said, but there is still no clear evidence that treatment with needles has any therapeutic effects either.\n\nAnd while the laser device used by clinics including Innovative Laser Therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for temporary pain relief, the agency has not cleared it to be marketed for smoking cessation.\n\nThe UK study found that the side effects of the treatment were similar to some withdrawal symptoms, and the FDA has classified the laser as a “nonsignificant risk” device. Pinto says that the biggest side effect he sees is that “people feel relaxed during the treatment.”\n\nNeil Camera, the president of Laser Therapeutics, Inc., says that FDA approval could be on the horizon. His company, which produces the lasers and supplies them to centers that are running clinical trials on the treatment’s effectiveness, has had an application for approval in to the FDA for three and half years, he said.\n\nBut the government organization had only dealt with drugs - not new technology - for smoking cessation, which has slowed down the process, Camera said. “The FDA didn’t know how to handle it, quite frankly,” he told Reuters Health. “That was the biggest drawback.”\n\nDr. Neil Spielholz, of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, was involved with the initial study submitted to the FDA - the same one that showed the success of laser treatment in UK smokers. The FDA had a couple of problems with that study, he said, including that successful quitting was measured by a smoker’s own reports, and not by more modern methods that calculate the amount of carbon monoxide in someone’s breath. In response, Laser Therapeutics is designing another study to address those comments, he said.\n\nA spokesperson from the FDA confirmed that the agency is aware of the concept of using low level lasers for smoking cessation and had been in discussions with those seeking to get it approved on how they should proceed.\n\nUsually three convincing studies involving large groups of human patients are needed before the FDA decides to approve a treatment.\n\nPinto says that Innovative Laser Therapy follows up on the success of all of its clients a month after the treatment for clinical evidence that will be part of the package of data presented to the FDA.\n\n“The company (Laser Therapeutics) is going crazy,” Spielholz told Reuters Health. “They want to get this thing approved, obviously.”\n\nBut, he said of the initial evidence in favor of the treatment, “this one is only a single study, which of course the people who believe in lasers will jump on ... (but) things have got to be confirmed. One study, no matter how many patients are in it, really needs one or two confirmation studies.”\n\nWON’T WORK ON EVERYBODY\n\nIf future studies do show its effectiveness, laser treatment would have a leg up over conventional methods of smoking cessation, such as medications including Chantix and Zyban, said Spielholz, who continues to work with Laser Therapeutics on getting FDA approval.\n\nThe lack of any drugs involved in laser therapy “would be the beauty of this,” he said. “You do not have those side effects of suicidal thoughts and feelings of paranoia that are reported for the drugs,” he said.\n\nStill, Laser Therapeutics’ Camera said, the treatment won’t work on everybody. “The person has to be wanting to quit smoking,” he said. “They can’t be dragged in by a spouse or whatever, because nothing’s going to work then.”\n\nDr. Martha Daviglus, who studies preventative medicine at Northwestern University, agreed that the most important part of any smoking cessation program was that smokers were ready to quit. After seeing the initial research, she’s hopeful, but cautious, about low-level laser therapy as a way to help people do that.\n\n“There are hundreds of methods to quit smoking,” she said. “We can hope that this is going to be a method that is going to help people.” But, Daviglus said, “We need more research and more evidence.”""]"," We don’t often see subheads like this: ""’NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE’ IN SCIENTIFIC TERMS; NOT FDA-APPROVED FOR QUITTING SMOKING; WON’T WORK ON EVERYBODY."" Beneath each subhead, the story dismantles the scientific claims of laser therapy proponents piece by piece.","This story does something that few stories accomplish.

Similar results were obtained by the National Cancer Institute USA in tests conducted on 60 cell lines.\n\nThe new drug works by forcing cancer cells to use their mitochondria, the ‘power house’ of a cell, to generate the energy necessary to function. Whilst healthy cells use mitochondria to generate energy, cancer cells contain defective mitochondria which are incapable of sustaining the cell’s energy requirements.\n\nIn the absence of FY26, cancer cells switch from using their defective mitochondria to using metabolic activity in their cytoplasm to generate energy. By stopping this switch of energy source, the drug causes the cancer cell to die.\n\nLead researcher Professor Peter Sadler, of the University of Warwick’s Department of Chemistry, said explains:\n\n“Healthy cells generate their energy in organelles called mitochondria, but cancer cells have defective mitochondria and are forced to generate energy through glycolysis in the cytoplasm. Our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells”.\n\nCommenting on the drug’s benefits when compared to existing platinum-based drugs, such as Cisplatin, Professor Sadler says:\n\n“Platinum-based drugs are used in nearly 50% of all chemotherapeutic regimens and exert their activity by damaging DNA and cannot select between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. This can lead to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting.”\n\n“Existing platinum-based cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course, as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked, but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action, remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as Cisplatin”.\n\nThe research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates, suggests co-researcher Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon:\n\n“Current statistics indicate that one in every two people will develop some kind of cancer during their life time, with approximately one woman dying of ovarian cancer every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK and two deaths every hour from bowel cancer.\n\n“It is clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more lives and our research points to a highly effective way of defeating cancerous cells”.\n\nThe research, supported by the European Research Council and titled Potent organo-osmium compound shifts metabolism in epithelial ovarian cancer cells, is published by PNAS. The paper describes the comprehensive systems biology approach used to elucidate the mechanism of osmium action of FY26, led by PhD student Jess Hearn. Importantly this analysis also pinpointed 3 mutations in the mitochondrial DNA of ovarian cancer cells.\n\nFollowing the successful test results the researchers have been awarded a Wellcome Trust Pathfinder grant to begin preclinical development of organo-osmium compounds.\n\nENDS.\n\nPR144 7 July 2015\n\nNotes:\n\nThe researchers thank the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (Grant 324594, Systems Biology studentship for J.M.H.), the European Research Council (Grants 247450 and 324594), and the Wellcome Trust (Grants 086357 and 102696) for support, as well as the European Union COST Action CM1105.']",This release about an experimental cancer drug was overly promotional in tone and did not provide many of the key pieces of information that we think news releases should convey about research.,"This University of Warwick release promises much more than it should, considering the research was conducted not on humans or even mice but on cell lines in labs. The release headline claims that a new compound called FY26 is “49 times more potent” than an existing chemotherapy, and a subhead says, “Effectiveness shown in tests on ovarian and bowel cancer.” But it’s a bit misleading to claim increased potency for a drug that’s never even been tested in humans, because the compound may not work the same way in humans as it does in a petri dish. The drug certainly faces a very long and uncertain road before it might be approved for use in actual cancer patients — something the release never warned readers about. This is interesting research that’s worth writing about, but the release desperately needed a statement cluing readers in to the very preliminary nature of the study.

The kids also missed fewer days of school and were less likely to need medical care.\n\nHowever, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results.\n\n""The decision about whether those children should have tonsillectomy for that temporary benefit is really tied to what those children need or what they\'re suffering with,"" Chinnadurai said. Kids who miss a lot of school or need frequent trips to the doctor due to sore throats could benefit from the surgery, he said.\n\nThere\'s an even clearer benefit for kids whose sleep is disturbed due to inflamed tonsils, Chinnadurai said.\n\n""In a child with a diagnosis of sleep apnea, we can see a benefit in sleep-related quality of life,"" he said. The kids get better sleep, and thus exhibit better everyday behavior and pay more attention in school.\n\nThe medical approach to treating tonsil infections has evolved over recent decades.\n\nTonsillectomy is the third most common surgery performed on U.S. children, with 530,000 such procedures completed each year, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nThirty years ago, nine out of 10 tonsillectomies in children were performed to treat recurring throat infections. These days, the procedure is done 20 percent of the time for infections and 80 percent of the time for sleep problems, according to the academy.\n\nSwollen tonsils can block the airway during sleep, causing breathing problems that range from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the researchers said in background notes.\n\nGuidelines say a tonsillectomy to treat throat infections is justified if a child had seven or more sore throats during the previous year; five or more sore throats two years running, or three or more sore throats for three years in a row, according to the background notes.\n\nThe researchers decided to review whether the throat infection guidelines are too stringent, ruling out patients who potentially could benefit but don\'t meet the high threshold of recurring infections, Chinnadurai said.\n\nThere aren\'t strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation.\n\nThe study results showed ""there may be new evidence that supports expanding the criteria and opening up the procedure to more individuals,"" said Dr. Alyssa Hackett, an otolaryngologist with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\n""In the right child with the right indications, these are really wonderful procedures that can be life-changing for both the child and the family,"" said Hackett, who wasn\'t involved with the new research.\n\n""If you need your appendix out, you need your appendix out,"" Hackett said. ""But for the tonsils and adenoids, there are great quality-of-life benefits that are evident for the surgery, but no child has ever died because they haven\'t gone through the surgery."" (Adenoids, glands at the roof of the mouth, are often removed along with tonsils.)\n\nStill, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.\n\nAbout 3 percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two-week recovery period, Hackett said.\n\n""Though a tonsillectomy is low-risk, it is not risk-free, and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child,"" Chinnadurai said.\n\n""We\'re talking about a child who has significant sleep-related issues,"" Hackett said. ""We don\'t want people to say my child snores, they need to have their tonsils out. That\'s not what this study says at all.""\n\nThe two reports were published online Jan. 17 in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on tonsillectomy, visit the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.']",The studies say that the medical literature is weak on a definitive answer that applies to all kids and that the proper approach depends on the individual.,"This story is based on two papers published in the journal Pediatrics (here and here) which were meta-analyses of studies in the medical literature about the success of tonsillectomies in reducing throat infections and in improving obstructed breathing while asleep.
The story includes a very good snapshot of how frequently tonsillectomies are performed today, and how that compares with 30 years ago. The article also includes prospective from an outside source on the implications of the new studies.
But the story characterizes the study results as promoting a change in tonsillectomy guidelines, rather than simply reporting on the findings of the analyses. One of the studies suggests that any improvement in throat infections is limited to only the first year following surgery, and that short-term benefit is noted in the article.
The story doesn’t mention costs and only briefly mentions the risks associated with this procedure. And while the studies are extremely careful in characterizing their findings, this story isn’t and generalizes the conclusions to the detriment of the readers.

These tumors were those that had returned following an initial surgical removal and follow-up treatment with procedures such as chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nSurvival rates using cryoablation were about 60 months, which is comparable to the survival rates for women whose tumors do not return after the first surgical procedure. However, about 80 percent of women who first treat their tumors with surgery do eventually experience a recurrence, according to Hyun J. Bang, MD, a radiology resident at Wayne State University.\n\nOvarian cancer is the deadliest of cancers that affect the female reproductive system, with about 22,000 women diagnosed each year and, in 2011, approximately 15,460 deaths. ""Unfortunately, this cancer produces few, if any, symptoms in early stages,"" said Bang.

It’s very difficult for any journalist to do a complete job reporting on a complex topic in less than 300 words.  The odds were stacked against this one given those limitations.

The phase II trial, conducted by researchers at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, demonstrated a host of benefits from the regimen.\n\nThe diet reduced cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, signs of inflammation (measured by C-reactive protein levels), as well as fasting glucose and reduced levels of IGF-1, a hormone that affects metabolism. It also shrank waistlines and resulted in weight loss, both in total body fat and trunk fat, but not in muscle mass.\n\nIn effect, the diet reduced the study participants\' risks for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related diseases, according to the findings published Feb. 15 in Science Translational Medicine.\n\n""This study provides evidence that people can experience significant health benefits through a periodic, fasting-mimicking diet that is designed to act on the aging process,"" said Valter Longo, director of the USC Longevity Institute and a professor of biological sciences for USC Davis and Dornsife. ""Prior studies have indicated a range of health benefits in mice, but this is the first randomized clinical trial with enough participants to demonstrate that the diet is feasible, effective and safe for humans.\n\n""Larger FDA studies are necessary to confirm its effects on disease prevention and treatment,"" he added.\n\nOne hundred people participated in the trial from April 2013 to July 2015. The participants, ages 20 to 70 and all generally healthy, were divided into two groups for the randomized trial.\n\nParticipants in the first group, the control group, were asked to continue their normal eating habits for three months. People in the second group were placed on a three-month test of the fasting-mimicking diet.\n\nThose on the special diet were required to eat food products supplied by the nutrition company L-Nutra during the fasting periods of five days each month. The diet, which was designed to mimic the results of a water-only fast, allowed for participants to consume between 750 and 1,100 calories per day. The meals for the fast-mimicking diet contained precise proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.\n\nAfter three months, participants in the control group were moved onto the special diet.\n\nThe researchers found that participants on the fasting-mimicking diet lost an average of about 6 pounds. Their waistlines shrank by 1 to 2 inches. Their systolic blood pressure, which was in the normal range when the study began, dropped by 4.5 mmHG, while their diastolic blood pressure dropped by 3.1 mmHg. Also, their levels of IGF-1 dropped to between 21.7 ng/mL and 46.2 ng/mL, reaching a range associated with lower cancer risk.\n\n""After the first group completed their three months on the fasting diet, we moved over participants in the control group to see if they also would experience similar results,"" Longo said. ""We saw similar outcomes, which provides further evidence that a fasting-mimicking diet has effects on many metabolic and disease markers. Our mouse studies using a similar fasting-mimicking diet indicate that these beneficial effects are caused by multi-system regeneration and rejuvenation in the body at the cellular and organ levels.\n\n""Our participants retained those effects, even when they returned to their normal daily eating habits,"" he added.\n\nThe researchers also noted that participants considered ""at risk"" because they had risk factors such as high IGF-1, cholesterol, blood pressure or blood sugar levels, made significant progress toward better health.\n\nFor example, baseline fasting glucose levels for participants with high blood sugar levels (putting them at risk for diabetes) dropped into the healthy range, below 99 mg/dl -- but these levels didn\'t drop among participants who already had healthy levels at the beginning of the study. Cholesterol was reduced by 20 mg/dl in those with high cholesterol levels, and by about 5 mg/dl in all participants.\n\n""Fasting seems to be the most beneficial for patients who have the great risk factors for disease, such as those who have high blood pressure or pre-diabetes or who are obese,"" Longo said.\n\nThe researchers had invited participants in the study for one last set of tests three months later, at the end of the diet. The research team found that the beneficial effects -- from weight loss, smaller waistlines and lower glucose, blood pressure and IGF-1 levels -- were sustained.\n\nThe next step for researchers is a large, FDA phase III clinical trial to test the FMD on patients diagnosed with age-related diseases or at high risk for them. The researchers said further investigation will determine whether the benefits of the diet can continue for several months.\n\n###\n\nThe work was funded by the USC Edna M.

His interest in L-Nutra has been disclosed and managed per USC\'s conflicts of interest policies to assure objectivity and a lack of bias in the conduct and reporting of his research.\n\nUSC also has an ownership interest in L-Nutra, and the potential to receive royalty payments from L-Nutra. USC\'s financial interest in the company has been disclosed and managed under USC\'s institutional conflict of interest policies.']","The release goes beyond what the study leaders reported, even contradicting a study author quoted within the release.","This is a news release marked by extravagant claims but a surprising lack of numerical data to back up those claims. It did not score well on our 10 systematic review criteria.
It’s about a small study of 100 people that looked at what happened if they consumed a low-calorie (between 750 to 1,100 calories per day) pre-packaged diet kit for 5 days intermittently over 6 months. The news release suggests that this regimen might lower the patients’ risks of “cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related diseases.” While the release says at the top that the trial “demonstrated a host of benefits” and later “that the diet is feasible, effective and safe for humans,” it says in the next line that larger studies are needed to confirm its effects.  So which is it?  Did it demonstrate effectiveness? Or is that an effect that needs to be confirmed?  The words matter, and can be misleading.
The news release alternated between caution and lack of discretion in describing the actual known outcomes of the diet. A study author is quoted saying the study did not prove a lowering of risk, but the news release ignores that warning and claims a risk-lowering was “demonstrated” by this early study.
One positive note: The release is to be commended for being transparent about potential conflicts of interest.

It was done before the FDA denied approval of the drug, asking for further research.\n\nOnly this study is not so new -- and its findings may be less weighty than might be concluded with its publication in this respected medical journal. Qnexa -- an investigational weight-loss drug that combines the anticonvulsant topiramate with the short-term diet drug phentermine -- was denied FDA approval last October. At that time, the FDA asked Vivus, the company sponsoring Qnexa\'s application for market approval, to conduct further research on the drug\'s safety.\n\nThe diet drug Qnexa helps obese people with weight-related medical conditions to lose more weight than those who take a dummy pill and could allow some to scale back on medications for diabetes, high blood pressure or cholesterol, according to a new study published online in the Lancet .\n\nThis newly published article details one of two clinical trials that were evaluated by the FDA before the agency decided to deny approval for Qnexa in October 2010. When the FDA\'s staff scientists combined the results of this study with a second study (both funded by Vivus, of Mountain View, Calif.) -- they concluded that the weight-loss difference between those taking Qnexa and those taking a placebo was ""of nominal statistical significance.""\n\nIn both the Lancet article and the accompanying press release, the secondary effects of subjects\' weight loss with Qnexa were highly touted: ""The findings published Online First in the Lancet ... suggest that this promising new treatment has additional metabolic benefits,"" the press release describing the study says. The authors write: ""Most importantly, weight loss achieved with phentermine and topiramate was sustained during 56 weeks with improvements in blood pressure, lipids, glycaemia, and inflammatory markers.""\n\nIn its assessment of those improvements in a June 17 memorandum last year, the FDA\'s scientists were not quite as breathless: The groups treated with Qnexa, they wrote, ""had the expected improvements in blood pressure, lipids and glycemia.""\n\nThe Lancet study does have some additional data not reviewed by the FDA - -and not entirely typical for such an article: comparisons between Qnexa\'s effectiveness for weight loss and that of two other drugs vying for the potentially vast U.S. market for weight-loss drugs. These other weight-loss-drug candidates, commercially known as Lorcaserin and Contrave, haven\'t won FDA approval either, but both remain under consideration. In a box labeled ""research in context,"" the authors offer a comparison that is certainly not apples to apples but which may give Qnexa some competitive edge: In studies performed by other researchers using different populations of subjects under different circumstances, the authors of the Lancet study note, Qnexa promoted greater weight-loss than Contrave, Lorcaserin or Orlistat (a fat-blocking drug long on the market).\n\nThe study described in the Lancet was funded by Vivus. Three of its seven authors are employees of Vivus, a fourth was an employee of the contract research organization that coordinated the study for Vivus. The lead author has served as a consultant to Vivus, and the second author acknowledged receiving donations, honoraria, consulting fees or grants from Vivus (as well as several other pharmaceutical firms with interests in weight-loss drugs).\n\nIn denying Vivus approval to market Qnexa in October, the FDA asked the company to extend the trial described in the Lancet article and to submit further findings on Qnexa\'s effect on subjects\' heart function, as well as on its safety for use in women who might become pregnant.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story gets a 4-star score as its </span>","We applaud the degree and clarity of the context and explanations provided by this story – about how this is not new info, how the FDA had problems with this kind of data when it reviewed it earlier, and how there were financial ties between the study authors and the drug maker.

Generally, massage is not covered by insurance, Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nPrevious studies of the effectiveness of massage were conducted in controlled research situations. In this study, patients were referred by a physician to a massage therapist. The massage therapist designed and provided a series of 10 massages -- at no cost to the patient -- in a clinical treatment environment, mimicking the experience of people who choose to seek massage therapy in the real world.\n\nThe study also looked at different characteristics associated with patients being more likely or less likely to experience clinically meaningful change from massage.

Unfortunately, the release omitted some important details such as how many volunteers were involved, how long the study lasted, including any follow-up, and how improvement in back pain was measured.

It works by significantly reducing the rate at which blood clots break down, the researchers explained.\n\n""When people have serious injuries, whether from accidents or violence, and when they have severe hemorrhage they can bleed to death. This treatment reduces the chances of bleeding to death by about a sixth, "" said researcher Dr. Ian Roberts, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the U.K.\n\nAccording to Roberts, each year about 600,000 people bleed to death worldwide. ""So, if you could reduce that by a sixth, you\'ve saved 100,000 lives in one year,"" he said.\n\nThe report, which was primarily funded by philanthropic groups and the British government, is published in the June 15 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nFor the study, Roberts and colleagues in the CRASH-2 consortium randomly assigned more than 20,000 trauma patients from 274 hospitals across 40 countries to injections of either TXA or placebo.\n\nAmong patients receiving TXA, the rate of death from any cause was cut by 10 percent compared to patients receiving placebo, the researchers found. In the TXA group, 14.5 percent of the patients died compared with 16 percent of the patients in the placebo group.\n\nWhen the researchers looked at deaths from bleeding, those in the TXA group experienced a 15 percent reduction in mortality. Among patients receiving TXA, 4.9 percent died from bleeding, compared with 5.7 percent of the patients receiving placebo, they found.\n\nAlthough there was some worry that TXA might lead to more heart attacks, strokes or clots in the lungs, the researchers observed no such increase among patients getting the drug.\n\nDr. Jerrold H. Levy, deputy chair for research at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that, ""these data are really neat, because any therapy to reduce mortality in trauma is, I think, a major finding.""\n\nUsing this drug to treat trauma patients is a completely new idea, Levy said. ""I think people should consider it [TXA] following trauma on the basis of this study,"" he said.\n\nCurrently, TXA is not generally used in emergency rooms to treat trauma patients, but Roberts believes that this study could change that.\n\n""It\'s not our job to tell doctors how to treat their patients, but this is a drug that is safe and effective in a condition where people have a high risk of death,"" he said.\n\nThe researchers believe that TXA could have even wider uses, such as reducing brain bleeds after brain injury. The drug could also be used to reduce postpartum bleeding, which the researchers say causes some 100,000 deaths a year worldwide.\n\nIn fact, a trial to see whether TXA can reduce postpartum bleeding has started, the team noted.\n\nLevy however, cautioned that the results of this study apply only to TXA and do not mean that people should try similar drugs hoping for similar results.\n\n""Everybody wants to be creative, but you have to look at the data, and they used TXA,"" Levy said. ""You can\'t get creative and say \'Ah, one of the other drugs will do the same thing\' -- you don\'t know that, and that\'s one of my concerns.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on trauma, visit the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Science.']","Like its competitors (we reviewed 3 such stories), HealthDay communicated the basic facts but failed to challenge some of the more optimistic claims regarding the lifesaving potential of the drug TXA.","The story also should have done more to examine whether the results of this international study are applicable to patients in the United States and other Western countries.

""Spinal manipulation should be considered a viable treatment option for those with non-specific, chronic low back pain.""\n\nThe study was recently published in the journal Spine.\n\nMore than 6,000 patients were included in the compilation of results, which the study authors said were sparse in data indicating participants\' overall recovery, quality of life and ability to return to work. The studies also varied in quality, with only nine of 26 considered ""low [in] bias,"" according to background information accompanying the study.\n\nIn all evaluations, patients were randomly assigned to SMT or another comparison treatment, including active treatments such as exercise or inactive placebo treatments.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the studies were not included in a previous review published in 2004, and all patients had suffered from lower back pain for 12 weeks or longer.\n\nWhile chiropractors often perform SMT on patients, it is also administered by physical therapists and osteopaths. But which treatment is right for any patient depends not only on their specific pain, but their doctor\'s recommendations and their own comfort level with various options, said Stephen Perle, a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Association.\n\nThe cost of SMT sessions varies widely depending on the region, Perle said.\n\n""Nobody has the answer at this time,"" Perle said. ""I guess people in almost every profession like to say, \'We have a compelling treatment and it will work almost every time,\' but that\'s just not the case.""\n\n""With low back pain, there are many reasons people don\'t get better,"" added Perle, also a professor of clinical sciences in the College of Chiropractic at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut. ""So the finding was not unexpected.""\n\nAn unrelated study of 401 patients with low back pain, published July 5 in Annals of Internal Medicine, suggested that massage may be better than medication or exercise for short-term pain relief.\n\nSeattle researchers found that those who received either relaxation massage or structural massage, which involved manipulation of muscles and ligaments, had less pain and better functioning for up to a year compared to those getting ""usual medical care,"" which included medication and physical therapy.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more information about low back pain.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story touched on an important truth about the treatment of chronic back pain—even if it missed some key points along the way. </span>","
The article focused on a recent systematic review of the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain.  The Cochrane Collaboration review found that this popular treatment leads to rapid short-term pain relief and improvement in function.
But the magnitude of the treatment effect was modest at best. And manipulation did not provide a “clinically significant” advantage over other common treatments for chronic low back pain, according to this review.
The HealthDay article made a key observation about chronic back pain: that there is no “silver bullet” for it. And it provided a brief but fair description of the systematic review and the evidence it considered.  Our reviewers could have gone either way on several of the graded criteria, so the 4-star final score may be a bit deceiving.
What were some of the shortcomings of this article? The article had a misleading title: “Study Questions Chiropractic’s Impact on Back Pain”.
This systematic review looked at the effects of manipulation as practiced by multiple professions rather than the impact of chiropractic per se. Since the review concluded that manipulation is a viable treatment for chronic back pain, one can argue that it supports rather than questions this manual therapy.
It might have been useful to ask an impartial expert how the new review on manipulation compares with other recent reviews of the evidence in this area. And how manipulation compares with other effective treatments for chronic back pain.
Readers of this article might well have come away with the impression that all treatments for chronic back pain offer similar results. This is not the case.
Of the 200 or so therapies for chronic back pain in the medical marketplace, no treatment consistently offers a major benefit. Only a few have been proven to provide a moderate benefit for chronic back pain.
The most influential U.S. guideline found only six treatments, including manipulation, where there was “good” evidence of a “moderate benefit” for chronic back pain (See Chou et al., 2007; Chou et al., 2009).
An influential British review concluded that three general approaches (exercise, manual therapy including manipulation, and acupuncture) provide roughly equal benefit in the early management of persistent back pain. (See NICE, 2009).
So the new review on manipulation is reasonably consistent with the larger evidence picture.
It would have been useful if the article could have highlighted this point—since it offers an important message for people with chronic back pain. Based on this body of evidence, they shouldn’t be expecting heroic cures. Rather, they should look for validated treatments that can help them stay comfortable and active—and that align with their values, expectations and tolerance for risk.

Despite its longtime use, warfarin remains tricky to dose because a person\'s genetic makeup influences how the drug is processed in the body. Too much warfarin can cause internal bleeding; too little warfarin fails to prevent blood clots.\n\nNow, a new study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that dosing warfarin (Coumadin and others) is safer -- producing fewer adverse events such as hemorrhage -- when key elements of a patient\'s genetic makeup are considered.\n\nThe research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis).\n\n""Physicians have been prescribing warfarin since the Eisenhower administration,"" said first author Brian F. Gage, MD, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ""It\'s a widely used anticoagulant, but it causes more major adverse events than any other oral drug. Thousands of patients end up in the emergency department or hospital because of warfarin-induced bleeding. But we continue to prescribe it because it is highly effective, reversible and inexpensive. So our goal is to make warfarin safer. GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy.""\n\nPatients in the trial were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received warfarin dosing based on standard factors such as age, height and weight; the second group was dosed based on these clinical factors plus genetic variants. Participating sites in the trial included Washington University School of Medicine, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, Intermountain Healthcare, University of Utah, and Rush University Medical Center.\n\nOf the 789 patients who were dosed in the traditional manner, 116 experienced at least one adverse event (14.7 percent). Of the 808 patients whose warfarin dosing was guided by genetic testing, 87 experienced an adverse event (10.8 percent). Compared with patients receiving traditional warfarin dosing, patients dosed with the genetic approach had a 27 percent reduction in adverse events, which was statistically different. The adverse events were bleeding, formation of blood clots in the veins and warfarin overdoses. No patient died during the trial.\n\nEarlier studies looking at whether genetic testing could improve warfarin dosing had produced conflicting results. However, these studies were smaller and considered fewer genes than GIFT. GIFT enrolled 1,600 patients age 65 and older at high risk of blood clots because they underwent hip- or knee-replacement surgeries.\n\nUnlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy. Genetic variants were assessed on a commercial platform called GenMarkDx. Variants in one gene affect vitamin K recycling. Variants in another gene affect warfarin sensitivity. Variants in the third gene alter warfarin metabolism in the liver and can cause an overdose if the dose is not adjusted soon enough.\n\n""There are additional genetic variants that may help to guide warfarin dosing, especially among patients with African ancestry,"" Gage said. In the future, we hope to quantify how these variants affect warfarin.""\n\nGage also noted how health-care costs relate to dosing warfarin in a genetically guided manner. ""Although genetic testing is more expensive than clinical dosing, the cost is falling,"" he said. ""In our study, we estimated that genetic testing costs less than $200 per person, which is less than one month of a newer anticoagulant.""\n\n###\n\nThis work was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers R01HL097036 and UL1TR000448; the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, grant number CAG-00400N; and GenMarkDx, which supplied instrumentation.\n\nGage BF, Bass AR, Lin H, Woller SC, Stevens SM, Al-Hammadi N, Li J, Rodriguez Jr. T, Miller JP, McMillin GA, Pendleton RC, Jaffer AK, King CR, DeVore B, Porche-Sorbet R, Napoli L, Merritt K, Thompson AM, Hyun G, Anderson JL, Hollomon W, Barrack RL, Nunley RM, Moskowitz G, Davila-Roman V and Eby CS for the GIFT investigators.

(It doesn’t apply.),"This news release describes results of a study designed to learn whether testing for the presence of three gene variants could make dosing with the blood thinner warfarin safer for patients given the drug to prevent blood clots after joint replacement surgery.
The study found a modest reduction in the risk of bleeding or clots (from over- or under-dosing) in those whose regimens were developed in part by genetic testing for the variants, compared to those whose doses were calculated without the genetic testing.
The release does an overall good job in describing the study, its purpose and design; and in quantifying the results. It could have been even stronger if it had included more information about newer alternatives to warfarin that are growing in use and an explicit statement that no one is yet recommending routine genetic testing for the variants based on this study. And although the headline somewhat over promises clinical benefit at this point in time, thoughtful readers will come away with a decent understanding of the context of the research and its potential impact.

Now, according to scientists at the University of Colorado, there is even evidence that the healthy fat can boost your chances of getting pregnant.\n\nThe study, presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting, was in mice, so more research needs to be completed before omega 3 foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility. But Dr. Malgorzata Skaznik-Wikiel, an obstetrician-gynecologist who led the study, is encouraged. She worked with a group of mice that are genetically bred to have healthy ratios of omega 3 fatty acids. These mice are born with the ability to bathe cells and tissues in omega 3 fats, so the team then looked at their egg development in the ovaries.\n\nWhat she found: The mice with the higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids seemed to have more precursors to egg cells than control mice with lower levels of the fat, meaning they had a larger reserve of eggs-to-be. These could then mature into a healthy egg that is fertilized and can lead to a live birth. When the ovaries were examined even further, Skaznik-Wikiel also found that the quality of the eggs were better among the animals with higher levels of omega 3s. Higher quality eggs improves the chances that the egg will be fertilized and develop into a live pup.\n\n“Based on this study, it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility,” says Skaznik-Wikiel. “Our study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility.”\n\nExactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn’t clear yet. But other studies Skaznik-Wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function.\n\nMore studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility, but for now, Skaznik-Wikiel says that there isn’t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats. (Some people who are predisposed to bleeding problems may be at higher risk of hemorrhages with high doses of omega 3s, but those cases are relatively rare.)\n\nThere may also be other benefits linked to omega 3 fatty acids for the fetus as well, in helping nerve development — that’s why many prenatal vitamins include forms of omega 3 fats. “We hope in the future to have more answers to be able to say firmly that yes, omega 3 fatty acids are the way to go [for women hoping to get pregnant,]” she says. “But even without that firm answer at this point I don’t see the harm in supplementing.”\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.']","When there are so many bigger issues worth writing about, why is a small study involving 10 mice making headlines?","Time magazine’s story states that a University of Colorado study has provided evidence that increasing the amount of healthy fat in one’s diet “can boost your chances of getting pregnant.” No, no, no. We just can’t know this yet: It’s mouse research. Involving all of 10 mice.
The story acknowledges this later, stating that “(m)ore studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility.” But not before making big claims, such as “researchers say that a common fat found in fish like salmon, and plants like flaxseed, may play a role in boosting fertility.”
Given the scant evidence this study provides to women trying to get pregnant, we question its news value in a national news magazine web site. And this isn’t our first time to critique TIME on writing about preliminary rodent research, nor many other outlets, including the PR machines who are often behind the curtain, pitching these stories to journalists.
We generally recommend putting these studies away and waiting until more conclusive human research comes along. But, if there’s no way around it, we recommend following this model for how to do it more accurately.

But he says by using an electroencephalogram and new, sophisticated computer programs to analyze the EEGs, he and his co-authors were able to correctly identify with 80% accuracy, which babies were at higher risk for autism and which were not.\n\nScientists have known for quite some time now that the earlier a child with autism gets therapy, the easier it is to improve language and behavioral skills. In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all children be screened for autism at the ages of 18 months and 24 months. Here researchers are trying to find markers for autism before a child begins showing signs of autism.\n\nIn a new study published Tuesday in the journal BMC Medicine, scientists studied 79 infants. 46 babies had a brother or sister with known autism, which means they themselves are at an increased risk for the neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about one in 110 children according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sibling of a child with a confirmed diagnosis of autism has a 1 in 5 chance of also developing the disorder. These infant siblings were compared with 33 infants with no known family history of autism.\n\nThe babies were given EEG\'s at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. Researchers strapped a net of 64 electrodes all over a baby\'s head while it was sitting in its mom\'s lap and a research assistant was blowing bubbles to hold the child\'s attention. The electrodes measured actual firings of neurons. The EEG technique is much easier to use because the baby can be awake and moving and wiggling around, says Dr. Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for the advocacy group Autism Speaks, which partially funded this research. Other brain imaging technologies like magnetic resonance imaging would require a baby to be asleep or sedated because they have to be completely still while the test is being done. ""Nobody wants to sedate a healthy infant,"" says Dawson.\n\nBosl explains that the new computer algorithms that he developed were able to analyze results of the EEG much better than in the past. He said that, judging by the differences in brain activity, he and his colleagues could detect which babies were in the high-risk group. They say they were nearly 100% accurate when the boys were 9 months old. They were most accurate with baby girls at age 6 months. Overall, the biggest differences in brain activity were seen at 9 months – which is much earlier than when a child typically shows behavioral problems associated with autism. The differences in brain activity were smaller as the babies got older.\n\nDoctors and scientists not connected to the study are intrigued by the results but caution that this is very early research and not something concerned parents can be looking for as a screening tool for their babies any time soon.\n\nSarah Paterson, Ph.D., is the director of the neuroimaging lab at the Center for Autism Research at Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia. She is also looking for early signs of autism as part of the Infant Brain Imaging Study, but her work focuses on differences in brain structure. Paterson says that if the results out of Boston can be confirmed, ""It\'s very exciting because finding an early sign for autism is really the holy grail."" But she cautions that a lot more work needs to be done. ""This study needs to be replicated by their lab and independent scientists,"" she says.\n\nDr. Max Wiznitzer says the researchers have found a ""really fascinating technique, that offers a different way to look at the brain."" Wiznitzer – a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children\'s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio – notes that what the study can\'t tell us is what the differences in brain activity between the two groups of babies actually mean. He, too, is hopeful that further research will provide more concrete information.\n\nBosl says the first children enrolled in his study are now at 2 and 3 years old, which is the age when autism usually is diagnosed. This will now allow the researchers to evaluate them for autism and then look back at the brain activity patterns of the children who do fit the clinical criteria for autism.\n\nBosl acknowledges that if this is very early research, but he believes if the results are confirmed, it may lead to a safe and inexpensive way to detect autism, which would allow intervention before any autistic behaviors appear.\n\n""It\'ll change the field, if this works,"" says Bosl. He hopes to expand the number of babies in his study to 200. ""The only thing slowing us down right now is funding.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story did a slightly better job than its <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3663"" target=""_blank"">HealthDay competition</a>, but neither story evaluated the evidence thoroughly enough, letting the researcher end the piece with: “It’ll change the field, if this works.”  Yes, but….</span>","The photo that ran with this story appeared straight out of a dystopian fantasy: a mother holding her infant, her shoulder draped in a loose, shawl-like lattice of wires connected to a swarm of electrodes attached to her baby’s head.

The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,000 people will be diagnosed with the disease this year, and 154,050 will die of it.\n\nMost patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer — disease that has spread beyond its original site — initially receive chemotherapy, which provides only marginal benefit. But the disease is so lethal that many patients don’t survive long enough to try second- or third-line treatments, so researchers are trying to develop and use more effective approaches earlier.\n\nAD\n\nThe trial that grabbed much of the spotlight Monday is a randomized effectiveness study that involved more than 600 untreated patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer — a common type of the disease. The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. One group was treated only with chemo, while the other got an immunotherapy drug called Keytruda plus chemo. Some of the results had been released previously, but not specific details.\n\nAD\n\nAfter a median follow-up time of 10.5 months, Gandhi said, the patients in the combination group were 51 percent less likely to die, compared with patients in the chemo-only arm.\n\n“For the first time, adding another drug has significantly impacted the long-term outlook for those patients,” she said.\n\nAD\n\nScientists who weren't involved in the study agreed that it was highly significant. H. Jack West, an oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, said, “It is literally practice-changing — immediately.”\n\nRoy Herbst, an oncologist at Yale Cancer Center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before. Still, he said, the approach was not a cure and there is a lot of room for improvement. The estimated proportion of patients in the combination therapy group who were alive and whose disease had not gotten worse at a year was about 34 percent, about double the proportion for the chemo-only group.\n\nAD\n\nLast May, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Keytruda-chemo combination based on an early-stage trial. But many doctors did not adopt it because the trial was small and didn’t initially show a survival benefit, Gandhi said.\n\nAD\n\nExperts said it was especially significant that the study showed that patients benefited from the Keytruda-chemo combination regardless of the levels of a protein, called PD-L1, found on their cancer cells. Researchers already had known that patients with high levels of the protein were more likely to respond to immunotherapy.\n\nLast week, in a related development, Merck, which makes Keytruda, reported that a different trial showed that the medication prolonged survival even when used alone, compared with chemo. Experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo.\n\nAD\n\nIn a second study published Monday, researchers used two other immunotherapy medications — Opdivo and Yervoy, both made by Bristol-Myers Squibb — to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a high number of mutations in their tumors.\n\nAD\n\nThe patients experienced a significantly longer period during which their disease did not worsen, compared with people who received only chemotherapy, said Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center oncologist Matthew Hellmann, who led the study.\n\nHe said the results established the double-immunotherapy combination as a first-line treatment for patients with a high “tumor mutational burden,” but that it was too early to know whether the treatment leads to longer survival. And he said the trial showed that “tumor mutational burden” is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications.\n\nAD\n\nAnother study published Monday used immunotherapy in a different way — for patients with early-stage lung cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering gave patients two doses of Opdivo — the first a month before surgery, the second two weeks before the operation — to try to stimulate anti-tumor activity and reduce the risk of relapse.\n\nAD\n\nNine of the 20 patients who got Opdivo had a “major pathologic response” — a sharp reduction in the number of cancer cells found in the tumors removed by surgery.\n\nDrew Pardoll, director of Hopkins’ Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival. But if future studies show that, he added, then immunotherapy might be used to augment or even replace chemo typically given before surgery.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD""]","Most significantly, it doesn’t tell us about the $150,000 annual price tag for each patient.","This story is one of two we reviewed about lung cancer immunotherapy studies presented at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting. Our other review is of TIME’s coverage.
The three drugs mentioned in the story — Keytruda, Yervoy and Opdivo — are known as checkpoint inhibitors, which remove the ability of some cancer cells to hide from the immune system.

In 2009, he had routine blood work that revealed an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. When PSA is above 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood, it can be one of the first signs of a prostate tumor. Harder’s PSA was 9.\n\nBy the time Harder saw a urologist, it had skyrocketed to 20. His doctor recommended the traditional next step: a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, which involves taking random tissue samples from 12 cross sections of the prostate.\n\nOver the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. They were all inconclusive.\n\n“It is frustrating to have a bunch of biopsies with a rising PSA and no proof of cancer,” Harder said.\n\nAfter Harder’s third biopsy, his urologist was ready to throw in the towel, and that’s when Harder was referred to Jinxing Yu, M.D., at VCU Health. By then, Harder’s PSA was around 30.\n\nYu is the director of oncologic and prostate imaging in the Department of Radiology at VCU. Over the past five years, he has developed diagnostic techniques using MRI technology to investigate difficult cases like Harder’s.\n\nAfter one MRI, Yu found Harder’s tumor. After that, Yu performed a targeted biopsy guided by the MRI scanner, allowing him to take tissue samples directly from the tumor.\n\nHarder finally had a diagnosis.\n\nIn 2012, he started on a treatment plan: hormone therapy for six months to shrink the tumor and prostate, and then external beam radiation to finish the job. Today, his PSA is normal.\n\nOther patients who continue to hit a brick wall with negative results from TRUS biopsies yet persistently high PSA levels may not be as fortunate.\n\n“A patient had 10 TRUS biopsies and his doctors still couldn’t find a tumor,” Yu said. “If you do not have this kind of advanced imaging, sometimes a patient runs into a situation when a tumor can’t be found and treated because it’s too late — it has already metastasized. He ends up diagnosed with cancer only after the tumor has spread to his bone or lymph nodes years later.”\n\nPrecise imaging leads to detection\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for the prostate have provided relief for patients like Harder who have not been able to get an accurate diagnosis. When caught early, prostate cancer is highly treatable.\n\nMuch like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. VCU Medical Center is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country doing advanced multiparametric MRI, which involves taking three different types of imaging sequences of the prostate.\n\nEach of the sequences — T2 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging — tells a story, and together they can be used to make a diagnosis with more than 90 percent accuracy.\n\nInterpreting a prostate MRI to be able to correctly diagnose cancer is a skill that can take years to develop. Yu and his team look for certain patterns that are typical of cancer on each of the different sequences.\n\n“If we put those characteristic features together from each sequence then we can say with a high degree of confidence that this area is concerning for cancer and potentially target it for biopsy,” said Sarah Winks, M.D., an attending physician in the Department of Radiology.\n\nAn MRI can also help determine how aggressive a tumor is, Yu said, and indicates if the tumor extends outside of the prostate and involves other areas — all information that helps urologists and radiation oncologists determine the best course of treatment.\n\nTraditional meets emerging technology\n\nIn addition to enhancing detection of prostate cancer, magnetic resonance technology also enhances the biopsy process with a procedure called magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy. MRI scans are overlaid with real-time ultrasound images to guide the biopsy needle to the tumor.\n\nIn 2014, VCU Health’s Department of Radiology, supported by the Division of Urology in the Department of Surgery, purchased ultrasound/MRI fusion biopsy equipment. Prior to this, Yu’s team had performed targeted MRI biopsies with the patient being moved in and out of the MRI scanner as the needle was guided to the target area — a sort of stop-motion procedure that could take up to an hour. The new equipment has simplified and shortened the process to about 20 minutes.\n\nA study published in 2015 by the Center for Cancer Research found that fusion biopsy is 30 percent more accurate in diagnosing high-risk, aggressive cancers than a TRUS biopsy. It is also much better at finding tumors in the anterior part of the prostate, near where Harder’s tumor was located.\n\nYu credits the technology and also having a dedicated team that can perform multiparametric-MRI, read the MRI scans and conduct biopsies with a very high success rate.\n\n“At most places, there will be a radiologist reading the MR image and a clinician performing the biopsy. The person reading the image and person putting in the needle is different,” Yu said. “Sometimes you don’t get the same result. We do both. That’s one of our strengths.”\n\nNew path to diagnosis\n\nYu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients’ care. “Five years ago, 95 percent of patients with prostate cancer or a high PSA would never get any imaging,” Yu said. “Right now, I think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging.” Sometimes, these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of Yu’s patients did last year.\n\nLast August, Jim Grandon of Colville, Washington, discovered he had a PSA of 5.3. It was elevated from the 4.1 measurement that he had registered for a few years. The rising PSA was cause for concern. Instead of going through with an immediate TRUS biopsy recommended by his urologist, he decided to research next steps.\n\n“With just going in and doing a blind biopsy like most urologists will do, you have anywhere from 35 to 45 percent success rate,” Grandon said. “I found three or four places around the country with a biopsy success rate of over 85 percent. When I went back to my urologist, he said, ‘Why spend money flying around the country when we can take care of you here?’ I said, ‘Because 85 percent is better than 40 percent.’”\n\nVCU Medical Center was one of the places Grandon had researched to get his diagnostic testing done, and a few phone calls later, he was on a plane flying across the country to see Yu.\n\nOn his second day in Richmond, Grandon had an MRI that showed a lesion. The next day, Yu biopsied it. On the fourth day, Grandon flew home and began researching treatment options. He opted for brachytherapy followed by external radiation at a clinic closer to home, and recently completed his treatment.\n\nA change in care\n\nMore and more, physicians are hearing about and understanding the benefits of MRI technology for prostate care, which has also been helpful in preventing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. According to the Center for Cancer Research study, MRI targeted biopsies detect 17 percent fewer low-risk tumors. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.\n\nWhen Yu started prostate MRI screening in 2011, his team performed about 50 scans per year. Now, with the support of Massey Cancer Center, Urology and Radiation Oncology, they are doing about 1,200 multiparametric-MRI and 200 imaging guided biopsies per year. He estimates the volume will continue to increase because VCU will attract patients not only from the Greater Richmond area but also patients such as Grandon from other parts of the country.\n\nYu hopes the advanced technology means positive changes in the standard of care. He speculates that in the same way women have a baseline mammogram, men would have a baseline prostate MRI and periodic magnetic resonance scans if warranted by bloodwork and family history.']",Do targeted biopsies ultimately lead to fewer deaths as claimed in the release? Years of prostate cancer research hasn’t borne that out.,"This news release touts a high-definition scan called multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MS-MRI), shown in studies to increase the accuracy of prostate cancer detection. The scan is used to identify suspicious lesions in the prostate that can be biopsied for cancer. A study at the Center for Cancer Research (National Cancer Institute, NCI) in Bethesda, Md., showed that targeted MRI-guided biopsies found more cases of high-risk prostate cancer while detecting fewer low-risk cancers compared with standard biopsies.
The news release presents this data but does not mention cost, associated risks, and the fact that more research is needed on whether targeted biopsies ultimately lead to fewer deaths. The news release hypes the procedure as having a “more than 90 percent success rate” without explaining what that means. Moreover, it stokes fear by selectively describing cancer cases discovered by MRI and stating that without advanced imaging cancer may not be found until it’s “too late.”  Reading this, one might conclude that all men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level would do well to hop on the next plane to Richmond.

The data was presented at the American Surgical Association annual meeting in San Diego. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is Stage III cancer that has not yet spread.\n\nPancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers and is expected to climb from the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. to the second by 2020. Ninety four percent of pancreatic cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis, and 74% of patients die within the first year of diagnosis.\n\n""The STAR data adds to the growing body of evidence that IRE ablation may represent a new treatment paradigm for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer,"" said Robert Martin, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S., director of the Division of Surgical Oncology, and Professor, Department of Surgery, University of Louisville, James Graham Brown Cancer Center. ""This new analysis of IRE could help change the standard of care for Stage III pancreatic cancer patients whose only treatment options until now were chemotherapy or a combination of chemo-radiation therapy, which will only stabilize the disease and not destroy the tumor. With IRE, these patients now have a surgical treatment option to augment their treatment plan.""\n\nThe NanoKnife® IRE system is a tool that destroys cancerous cells by subjecting them to a series of short electrical pulses using high-voltage direct current that does not injure surrounding cells, blood vessels and other vital structures. IRE overcomes rapid growth of the tumor by killing all malignant cells at once so they cannot continue to grow and spread. The NanoKnife® IRE system is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It is not approved for use in specific cancers.\n\nAbout STAR\n\nSTAR was a retrospective analysis of IRE performed on 200 consecutive patients diagnosed with locally advanced (Stage III) pancreatic cancer (LAPC) at six centers in the U.S. The centers that collaborated on the study included University of Louisville, Louisville, KY; Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI; Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, GA; Swedish Medical Center, Denver, CO; and Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Atlanta, GA.\n\nFrom July 2010 to October 2014, patients with radiographic Stage III LAPC were treated with IRE and monitored under a multicenter, prospective IRB-approved registry. Perioperative 90-day outcomes, local failure, and overall survival were recorded and compared to standard of care data for Stage III LAPC. All patients underwent induction chemotherapy with 52 percent receiving chemo-radiation, for a median of 7 months (range, 5-13) prior to IRE. IRE was successfully administered to all patients. Nineteen percent sustained complications with a median grade of 2 (range 1-3). Median length of stay was 6 days (range, 4-58) with a median follow-up of 25 months. Six patients (3%) had local recurrence. Median overall survival in both groups was 23.5 months.\n\nAbout the University of Louisville Physicians Group and The James Graham Brown Cancer Center:\n\nThe James Graham Brown Cancer Center is a key component of the University of Louisville Health Sciences Center.

About half the students received a snack of peanuts or peanut butter three to four times a week, while the rest received the snack fewer than once a week. The snack was administered after school as students were boarding the school bus to go home. Peanuts were chosen because nuts are nutrient-dense snacks that promote a feeling of being full.\n\nFollowing the 12-week intervention, students spent 12 more weeks maintaining the healthy snacking habit. At the end of the period, those students who received the snack more regularly experienced a decrease in their overall BMI (-.7kg/m2) compared to those who did not receive the regular peanut snack (-.3kg/m2). The researchers conclude that afterschool programs and schools can replace energy dense, unhealthy snacks with peanuts to provide a healthier alternative for children (researchers in the study ensured students did not suffer from nut allergies).\n\nJohnston says the fight against obesity needs creative solutions that help people manage their weight, appetite and hunger by offering socially acceptable food choices.\n\n""Schools are doing a great job of teaching kids, getting them workforce ready, and a whole bunch of other things.

To supply the restaurant, he started an organic vegetable farm in Whately, in the fertile soil of the Connecticut River Valley. Because he grew a lot of vegetables, he started an organic produce trucking and distribution business. Then followed an immense commercial sprout business.\n\nBy 1985, the Chinese entrepreneur was casting about for new commercial crops to grow that would impart both food value and medicinal benefits. In conversations with his friend Dr. Shiu Hu of Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, Chang became enamored of growing schisandra, a berry highly prized in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for its purported longevity promoting powers. Hu provided Chang with the fist seeds for this venture, which he planted at his Whately farm.\n\nToday, Pioneer Valley Schisandra cultivates over fifty acres of U.S.D.A. Certified Organic Schisandra berries. The farm has been producing berries since the early 1990’s, and representatives from a number of giant multi-national corporations have driven out to the foothills of the Berkshires to kick tires and contemplate what they might do with a whole lot of schisandra berry.\n\nAt the farm during harvest, a number of Latinos work the berry bushes, which are set up on fenced wires, like the French espalier method of growing. The berries ripen inconsistently, so harvesters will make a few passes through the orchard during harvest season. Chang designed this way of cultivating schisandra, and actually went back to China to teach this method to growers there in China’s northern Liaoning Province. I visited that region in 2009 for the harvest, and saw that by that time, Chang’s method was commonly used everywhere.\n\nAt age 87, the clock is ticking for the fulfillment of Chang’s mission, but he seems to be in the right spot for this. Schisandra chinensis has been used in TCM for over 2,000 years. Schisandra is still relatively unknown in the U.S. market. But due to its age-old use for enhancing vitality and its strong science base, the berry and its preparations should get a good market boost in the years ahead.\n\nThe berry of schisandra owes its name Wu Wei Zi (five flavored berry) to the fact that it is sweet, sour, salty, bitter and pungent. Schisandra chinensis enjoys millennia of traditional use for prolong life, retarding the aging process, increasing energy, as a fatigue-fighter, and as a sexual tonic. Schisandra also possesses significant protective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. It is considered one of the most highly protective of all medicinal plants, and the berry is included in many traditional herbal formulas for improving energy and mental health.\n\nThe activity of the berry appears due primarily to its concentration of two groups of novel compounds, known respectively as schizandrins and gomasins. These agents are lignans, and are extensively well studied for internal and topical benefits.\n\nSchisandra counters stress by reducing the levels of stress hormones in the blood. Additionally, schisandra offers great benefits for athletes. In human studies the berry and its extracts have improved performance among long distance runners, skiers and gymnasts. For this reason schisandra berry is often found on the training tables of Chinese athletes.\n\nSchisandra also offers special benefits for the mind. Several human studies show that schisandra extract improves concentration, coordination and endurance. Schisandra helps to prevent mental fatigue and increases accuracy and quality of work. In various human clinical studies with doctors, students, soldiers and other groups, schisandra demonstrated superior mind-sharpening powers.\n\nAs if all these benefits were insufficient, schisandra also offers first-rate liver-protective benefits. Schisandra helps in the treatment of hepatitis, as noted in over 500 cases. In fact, an antihepatitis drug was developed from Schizadrin C.\n\nStanding outside in the early fall sun, admiring healthy schisandra bushes, it’s hard not not be impressed by the size and scope of Chang’s farm, and by his long-time commitment to this berry and its future. When Hippocrates advised to let your food be your medicine, he could easily have been referring to schisandra, whose time in the sun must surely come.\n\nChris Kilham is a medicine hunter who researches natural remedies all over the world, from the Amazon to Siberia. He teaches ethnobotany at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he is Explorer In Residence. Chris advises herbal, cosmetic and pharmaceutical companies and is a regular guest on radio and TV programs worldwide. His field research is largely sponsored by Naturex of Avignon, France.

And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick.\n\n""I was amazed with the results of pRF,"" said study author Dr. Alessandro Napoli. ""Especially having read, as a radiologist, numerous lumbar MRI scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery.""\n\nAnd as a patient himself, Napoli added that ""from personal experience I can tell you that the treatment is not painful, and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting 10 minutes.""\n\nNapoli is a professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\nHe and his colleagues plan to report their findings Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nLower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open, allowing jelly-like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots. Beyond lower back pain, the condition often triggers sciatica, a pain that radiates down a patient\'s leg.\n\nStandard therapies include over-the-counter pain meds, corticosteroid spinal injections, and/or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion.\n\nThe problem, said Napoli, is that such options entail risks without assured relief.\n\n""Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions,"" he noted. And though surgery safety has ""largely improved,"" Napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection, the need for a minimum two- to three-day hospital stay, the high cost, and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit.\n\nBy contrast, pRF is scalpel-free, delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a CT scan-guided electrode. The process, said Napoli, requires no hospital stay, is noninvasive, far cheaper and less risky.\n\n""The rationale for using pRF on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root,"" he explained. ""Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients.""\n\nFor the study, the Italian investigators compared 128 lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single 10-minute round of CT-guided pRF with 120 patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections.\n\nAll the patients had already undergone standard interventions, with poor results.\n\nBy the one-year mark following either treatment, a full ""perceived"" recovery was reported by 95 percent of the pRF patients, compared with just 61 percent of the steroid injection patients.\n\nDr. Daniel Park, director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., offered some caution on the findings.\n\nHe noted that because ""the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone,"" it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.\n\nStill, Park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient\'s pain, given that ""the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it, and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain.""\n\nNevertheless, he remains unsure if pRF is truly ready for prime time.\n\n""Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication,"" said Park. ""It may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections, but they need more treatment. I think this is experimental, and should not be first-line.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers more information on herniated disks.']",It’s too bad those comments don’t appear until the end.,"This story describes research results presented at a radiology meeting that compared treating patients with lower back pain from disk herniation with either a pulsed radiofrequency (pRF) probe or multiple steroid injections.
We also reviewed a news release about this research.
Among the story’s strengths: It alerts readers that the study — presented as an abstract — has yet to be peer-reviewed and published, and it provides cautious comments from an independent source, although they appear at the very end.
However, the story leaves readers in the dark about how the treatment was evaluated and what it costs, and misses some important limitations with the evidence.
It largely ignored potential harms, including the possibility that some patients might be treated unnecessarily because the cause of back pain can be difficult to diagnose.

Although it has been on the market since 2006, Deplin is generating growing buzz at psychiatric conferences and among clinicians and patients, particularly those who haven\'t responded to antidepressants or did for a while only to have their depression return.\n\n""Many of the patients I put on Deplin come back and say, \'Wow, my medication is working again\' or \'Hey, doc, this medicine never worked this well before,\' "" says psychiatrist Thor Bergersen, who practices in Needham, Mass., and New York City.\n\nIt\'s long been known that folate—found naturally in green, leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and some fruits—is important for cell growth and brain function. How and why is now becoming clearer. Recent research has found that the body converts folate (and folic acid, the synthetic version) into an active form called L-methylfolate, which is needed to produce serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, three neurotransmitters that are critical in regulating mood.\n\nTrial and Error For many patients, treating depression involves trying multiple drugs over a long period of time. • Nearly 20 million people in the U.S. suffer depression during their lifetime. •11% of Americans over age 12 take antidepressants. • Only 30% get well on the first antidepressant alone. • Up to 50% of patients never reach remission. • People with low folate levels are six times as likely to fail to respond to antidepressants as those with normal levels. Sources: CDC; NIMH; Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology\n\nAging, illness, genetics, poor nutrition, excess alcohol consumption and some medications can all reduce L-methylfolate levels, leaving those neurotransmitters in short supply, some researchers say. While many popular antidepressants slow the ""reuptake"" of serotonin or norepinephrine, making them available longer to the brain, such drugs may not work for long or at all if the brain isn\'t producing sufficient quantities of the neurotransmitters in the first place, some experts theorize.\n\n""This is a totally new way to look at depression. We may be getting at the very foundation of why many people never achieve a full remission,"" says John Zajecka, director of the Depression Treatment & Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Dr. Zajecka has helped investigate Deplin and is on the speakers bureau for its maker, Pamlab LLC, of Covington, La.\n\nPamlab officials say that Deplin, which contains L-methylfolate, can directly supply what some people need to make sufficient quantities of neurotransmitters that regulate mood. And it does so more efficiently than taking extra folic acid, which still needs to be converted, they say.\n\nAs convincing as that sounds, clinical evidence is limited. Pamlab, which currently has the market to itself, sells Deplin as a ""medical food,"" a category that isn\'t held to the same standards the Food and Drug Administration demands of new drugs. Medical foods are intended to provide dietary management for a disease or condition; all ingredients must be ""generally recognized as safe"" and physician supervision is required.\n\nNearly 30,000 clinicians have prescribed Deplin in the past three years, according to Pamlab, and monthly prescriptions grew 31% to nearly 39,000 in October from January 2011. Still, that\'s a tiny fraction of the more than 20 million prescriptions for antidepressants every month in the U.S.\n\nJust two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated Deplin, with a total of 223 subjects. Both were supported by Pamlab. In one study, presented at the American Psychiatric Association\'s meeting in May, 75 depressed patients were randomly assigned to take either 15 milligrams of Deplin or a placebo along with an antidepressant. After 30 days, 32% of subjects on Deplin had responded, compared with 15% on the placebo. However, an earlier study using a lower dose of Deplin found no difference with a placebo. Subjects reported no more side effects with Deplin than with the placebo in either trial.\n\nAbout Folate • Folate, a B vitamin found naturally in some foods, is needed to maintain cell growth and brain function. Deficiencies are associated with depression, certain types of anemia and birth defects. Poor diet, aging, illness, alcoholism and some medications can lower folate levels. • Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, found in supplements and used to fortify grains. • L-methylfolate, the active form of folate, helps produce the neurotransmitters critical to regulating mood. About 50% of Americans have genetic variations that reduce their ability to create L-methylfolate, which may raise their risk of depression. Sources: CNS Spectrum; WSJ reporting\n\nThe biggest gripe with Deplin is the cost: One month\'s supply of Deplin, either at 7.5 milligrams or 15 milligrams, can cost as much as $98 and not all insurers cover it. Pamlab has a licensed generic version called simply L-Methylfolate that went on the market in August and is priced somewhat lower. More insurers are covering that version, some with copayments as low as $20, says Pamlab, which also makes medical foods for managing other conditions, including asthma.\n\nPamlab officials say they hope eventually to win FDA approval for Deplin as a prescription drug. The company says it plans to start Phase II trials later this year; one branch of the trials will assess whether Deplin could effectively treat depression on its own.\n\nResearchers also hope to determine which patients would benefit most from Deplin, to cut down on the frustrating trial-and-error process many people face in finding an effective antidepressant. One target could be people who have a genetic variation that reduces their ability to make L-methylfolate. Roughly 30% of the U.S. population has one abnormal copy of the gene known as MTHFR 677, and 12% has two abnormal copies, giving them less than one-third of the typical amount of L-methylfolate, researchers say.\n\nBut some people who had two normal copies of the MTHFR gene also responded well to Deplin, ""so there are clearly other factors involved as well,"" says Harold Koch, Pamlab\'s chief scientific officer.\n\nDespite the uncertainties, some clinicians say they are comfortable prescribing Deplin. ""I have had people write me thank-you notes because it\'s given them a boost of energy and happiness,"" says Judy Paley, an internist in Denver, Colo.\n\n""My patients who have responded are not people who are suggestible. They\'ve been trying different medications for years,"" says Andres San Martin, a Manhattan psychiatrist who specializes in treating resistant depression.\n\nOther experts are more cautious. ""It doesn\'t appear to have a lot of downsides, but sometimes it takes a few years of use to recognize them,"" says Ken Duckworth, medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an education and advocacy group. Dr. Duckworth also urges patients with resistant depression to try cognitive-behavioral therapy, aerobic exercise and substance-abuse programs, all of which have clear evidence of effectiveness. ""And remember there is no silver bullet,"" he says.\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com']",This story says there is a “growing buzz” surrounding a new approach to depression treatment. It should have more forcefully delivered the buzzkill: there is almost no supporting trial evidence.,"The story looks at a supplement that contains a derivative of folic acid known as L-methylfolate (brand name Deplin). Although there is a reasonable theoretical basis to think that this supplement might be beneficial for treating depression, there is very little evidence from clinical studies to support its use. With that in mind, we were dismayed to see so many quotes from clinicians who say their patients seem to benefit from the supplement, while so little time is spent discussing the shortcomings of the current evidence base–which are considerable. The story does eventually get to an appropriate message: “clinical evidence is limited”; it’s just that this conclusion may get lost in the clutter of surrounding anecdotes.

Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\nThere were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nIn their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.\n\nSuch a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.\n\nThe commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU\'s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\n""The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,"" said Hennekens.\n\nQuitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.\n\n""For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it\'s never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it\'s never too early,"" said Hennekens.\n\nThe authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.\n\n###\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.\n\nAmong the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives. In 2016, he was ranked the No. 14 ""Top Scientist in the World"" with an H-index of 173.\n\nAbout the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine:\n\nFAU\'s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine is one of 145 accredited medical schools in the U.S. The college was launched in 2010, when the Florida Board of Governors made a landmark decision authorizing FAU to award the M.D. degree. After receiving approval from the Florida legislature and the governor, it became the 134th allopathic medical school in North America. With more than 70 full and part-time faculty and more than 1,300 affiliate faculty, the college matriculates 64 medical students each year and has been nationally recognized for its innovative curriculum. To further FAU\'s commitment to increase much needed medical residency positions in Palm Beach County and to ensure that the region will continue to have an adequate and well-trained physician workforce, the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine Consortium for Graduate Medical Education (GME) was formed in fall 2011 with five leading hospitals in Palm Beach County. In June 2014, FAU\'s College of Medicine welcomed its inaugural class of 36 residents in its first University-sponsored residency in internal medicine.\n\nAbout Florida Atlantic University:']",This release urges greater use of a drug while offering “reassurance” to clinicians and patients of its safety and effectiveness. The expert making the claims should also reassure us that his financial ties to the drug maker had no bearing on his analysis.,"This news release from Florida Atlantic University amplifies a bold claim made in a medical journal commentary that the FDA’s “black box” warnings on varenicline (Chantix) medication labels encouraged many people to avoid the drug — and that failure to use the drug caused thousands of people to die prematurely from heart attacks and cardiovascular disease.
That’s a speculative claim, and one that the release does not back up with evidence.
The release also urges wider use of Chantix, a prescription medication. The FDA required Chantix to carry the warning of side effects from 2009 until December 2016. The release does not address the lingering debate over the safety of Chantix — or note that the senior author of the commentary has served as an advisor to Pfizer, the company that sells Chantix.

The most common drugs before treatment were metformin, a generic taken by about half of patients, followed by the medicines Avandia and Actos, taken by more than one-third of patients.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins researchers also calculated the effects of surgery on health costs for the patients. After a $616 increase in expenses during the first year following surgery, the costs declined by $2,179 in the second year and $4,497 in year three. The costs were compared with the median annual health costs before surgery -- $6,367.\n\nThe researchers argue that the findings, drawn from data on four years of claims made in seven states, support coverage of bariatric surgery by insurers because of the savings and improvements in patients' health.\n\nThe ultimate savings case requires some extrapolation, though. The cost of the surgery was about $30,000, which exceeds the savings observed directly. Also, at two years after surgery, data were available for less than half the patients. By year three, the data were only available for 288 patients, about 13 percent of those who got the surgery.\n\nFinally, surgery isn't without risk.

Greenberg, chief of urologic oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study.\n\n""This is relatively early stage disease, and it shows what we would expect it to show: that those who have more years [to live] have better survival if treated aggressively,"" he said.\n\nMen with prostate cancer face a confusing maze of options today, including not only surgery but hormone therapy, different kinds of radiation therapy and even simply foregoing medical treatment while monitoring the cancer closely (""watchful waiting,"" also known as ""active surveillance"").\n\n""Watchful waiting"" is often recommended when a man is not expected to die of the cancer and would like to avoid the risk of the debilitating side effects associated with prostate cancer treatment. These may include: incontinence and erectile dysfunction (surgery); erectile dysfunction and secondary cancers (radiation therapy); nausea, breast growth, liver problems (hormonal therapy); and weakness, hair loss, fluid retention (chemotherapy).\n\nThe data presented in the May 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine is a 15-year follow-up of a study for which three-years of follow-up had previously been reported.\n\nThe earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause.\n\nThe researchers, Drs. Anna Bill-Axelson and Lars Holmberg of University Hospital, Uppsala, and colleagues, enrolled nearly 700 men with early prostate cancer under the age of 75 who were randomly selected either to undergo a radical prostatectomy or to stay in ""watchful waiting"" mode.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of about 13 years, 14.6 percent of the men who had undergone surgery had died, versus 20.7 percent in the watchful waiting group, a 38 percent reduced risk.\n\nThe benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life.\n\nThere was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics.\n\nMen whose cancer had moved outside of the prostate gland and who underwent removal of the prostate had a seven times higher risk of dying than men whose tumors hadn\'t spread.\n\nRadical prostatectomy can come with a price -- including erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and even bowel incontinence -- although these effects are not as common as techniques improve. A nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, for example, may be able to prevent erectile dysfunction.\n\nAlso, the men in this study were diagnosed only after they had symptoms, unlike the majority of men in the United States, Greenberg said.\n\n""The advantage of screening is that men are more likely to be cured of cancer but they also have a greater chance of not succumbing to the consequences of the surgical complications, whether [those] be erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence,"" Greenberg said.\n\nAlso, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases.\n\nBut much remains to be known about how best to treat different types of prostate cancer.\n\n""The management of early stage prostate cancer continues to require further randomized controlled studies, which are underway, to determine the true benefit of treatment versus expectant management,"" said Dr. Marc Danziger, an attending urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved with the study.\n\n""Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance,"" Danziger added.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer treatments.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The headline is potentially misleading for readers.  Otherwise this is a reasonably well done story. </span>","As with the NPR and AP stories we also reviewed, this story helped frame this issue in the first few lines rather than burying it at the end as so often is the case. To have an expert not involved in study quoted in the second paragraph saying “findings are not likely to be practice-changing” provides readers with balanced perspective right from the start.  It was also good that the story concluded with a quote that expanded on what it means to “individualize” treatment. Unlike the concluding quote in the NPR story, this one provided language suggestive of shared decision making by adding ‘in relation to the risk stratification of disease, PATIENT DESIRES, health status, and RISK TOLERANCE”. (emphasis added)  Good way to end the story.

Tell them it’s a drug that costs $100 per dose. And if you want to make it even more effective, tell them it costs $1,500 instead.\n\nThat’s what researchers from the University of Cincinnati discovered in an unusual clinical trial. Instead of testing a placebo against an actual drug, they pitted two placebos against each other. The only difference between the two sham treatments was their purported price.\n\nMedical researchers are well aware that the dummy pills used in clinical trials often provide as much relief as the actual drugs being tested. This is what’s known as the placebo effect, and it’s quite common in people with Parkinson’s, a movement disorder that causes tremors, stiffness and balance problems. A 2008 meta-analysis found that placebos used in clinical trials of Parkinson’s treatments improved symptoms by an average of 16%.\n\nThe team from the University of Cincinnati and their colleagues had a hunch that patients would be more responsive to a fake drug they thought was real if it came with a heftier price tag. The higher price would be seen as a signal that the treatment was better, they figured.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo they recruited 12 patients with “moderately advanced” Parkinson’s and asked them to participate in a clinical trial of a medication described as “a new injectable dopamine agonist.” Patients with Parkinson’s lose the brain cells that produce dopamine, and a drug like this could pick up the slack.\n\nThe study volunteers were told that there were two versions of the experimental drug and that both were believed to work equally well. The main difference, the story went, was the way they were made. As a result, one version cost 15 times more than the other.\n\nIn reality, both placebos were composed of the exact same saline solution. And yet, the patients perceived the expensive version to be more effective than the cheaper one, according to results published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.\n\nBoth of the placebos improved motor function compared with a base line test. But when patients got the $1,500-per-dose placebo, their improvement was 9% greater than when they got the $100-per-dose placebo, the researchers reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn another test, 67% of the patients were judged “very good” or having “marked improvement” after they took the expensive placebo, compared with 58% of patients after they took the purportedly cheap placebo.\n\nThe researchers also used functional MRI scans to assess the patients’ brain activity and found that the “cheap” placebo prompted more action than the “expensive” one. To the researchers, this was a sign that the patients expected less from the placebo they believed cost less, so their brains responded by doing more work.\n\n“Patients’ expectations have an important role in the efficacy of medical therapies,” the researchers wrote. Another manifestation of this is the preference many patients have for name-brand drugs instead of their generic counterparts, they added.\n\nPlacebos may be fake, but understanding the placebo effect – and finding ways to make the most of it – is a real priority for researchers. To the extent that doctors can use placebos to improve patients’ symptoms, they can use the real drugs less, which may be expensive or toxic.\n\n“Placebo can be the physician’s friend,” a pair of neurologists wrote an editorial that accompanied the study. “The outcome of this study … opens our eyes to another nuance of placebo effect.”\n\nFor medical news that’s the real deal, follow me on Twitter @LATkarenkaplan and “like” Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.']",A pretty good overview of an interesting study on placebos. It had one significant omission.,"This story summarizes a study that tested responses to two placebos — one cheap and one expensive — in patients with Parkinson’s disease. The expensive placebo seemed to work better, but the effect was small. The study itself was also tiny — just 12 patients — which is something we think the story should have called more attention to.

But ketamine has not been tested in a large clinical trial, and all evidence of its antidepressant effects has come from anecdotes and small studies of fewer than 100 patients. Now, in the largest study of its kind, researchers at Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at University of California San Diego mined the FDA Adverse Effect Reporting System (FAERS) database for depression symptoms in patients taking ketamine for pain. They found that depression was reported half as often among the more than 41,000 patients who took ketamine, as compared to patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain.\n\nThe study, published May 3 in Scientific Reports, also uncovered antidepressant effects for three other drugs typically used for other purposes -- Botox, the pain reliever diclofenac and the antibiotic minocycline.\n\n""Current FDA-approved treatments for depression fail for millions of people because they don\'t work or don\'t work fast enough,"" said senior author Ruben Abagyan, PhD, professor of pharmacy. ""This study extends small-scale clinical evidence that ketamine can be used to alleviate depression, and provides needed solid statistical support for wider clinical applications and possibly larger scale clinical trials.""\n\nAbagyan led the study with pharmacy students Isaac Cohen and Tigran Makunts, and Rabia Atayee, PharmD, associate professor of clinical pharmacy, all at Skaggs School of Pharmacy.\n\nThe FAERS database contains more than 8 million patient records. The research team focused on patients in the database who received ketamine, narrowing their study population down to approximately 41,000. They applied a mathematical algorithm to look for statistically significant differences in reported depression symptoms for each patient.\n\n""While most researchers and regulators monitor the FAERS database for increased incidences of symptoms in order to spot potentially harmful drug side effects, we were looking for the opposite -- lack of a symptom,"" Cohen said.\n\nThe team found that the incidence of depression symptoms in patients who took ketamine in addition to other pain therapeutics dropped by 50 percent (with an error margin less than 2 percent) compared to the patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain. Patients who took ketamine also less frequently reported pain and opioid-associated side effects, such as constipation, as compared to patients who received other pain medications.\n\nAccording to Abagyan, it is possible that another factor common to patients taking ketamine was driving the antidepressant effect, such as the fact that ketamine also relieves pain. That\'s why they compared ketamine patients with patients taking other pain medications. That control group eliminated the possibility that people who take ketamine have less depression because they have less pain. Abagyan says it\'s still possible, though unlikely, the effect could be due to a still unidentified confounding factor.\n\nThree other drugs with previously under-appreciated antidepressant effects also emerged from this analysis: Botox, used cosmetically to treat wrinkles and medically to treat migraines and other disorders; diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); and minocycline, an antibiotic.\n\nAfter the diclofenac finding, Abagyan and team went back and looked at ketamine patients who did not also take NSAIDs and compared them to patients who took any other combination of drugs for pain except NSAIDs. Depression rates in patients taking ketamine remained low.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that the antidepressant effects of diclofenac and minocycline may be due, at least in part, to their abilities to reduce inflammation. For Botox, the potential mechanism for reducing depression is less clear. The team is now working to separate Botox\'s beauty effects (which could indirectly make a person feel better emotionally) and its antidepressant effects. To do this, they are first using FAERS data to determine if collagen fillers and other cosmetic treatments similarly affect depression rates.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people experience depression worldwide. If not effectively treated, depression can become a chronic disease that increases a person\'s risk of mortality from suicide, heart disease or other factors. Depression is currently treated with five classes of antidepressants, most commonly serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\nFor financial and ethical reasons, ketamine has never been tested for its safety and effectiveness in treating depression in a large-scale clinical trial, but it reportedly works much more rapidly than standard antidepressants. Ketamine is relatively inexpensive and is covered by most health insurance plans if three other antidepressants fail.\n\n""The approach we used here could be applied to any number of other conditions, and may reveal new and important uses for thousands of already approved drugs, without large investments in additional clinical trials,"" Makunts said.\n\n###']",A convoluted study and lack of cause and effect didn’t stop UCSD from making strong claims about ketamine.,"In this study of the effect of the anesthetic drug ketamine on depression, researchers at University of California – San Diego data-mined the FDA Adverse Effect Reporting System database for information on ketamine use for pain relief. Their analysis found an association between ketamine and reduced incidence of depression. However, the absence of depression the researchers found in 41,000 people (out of 8 million entries in the database) taking ketamine for pain relief in no way proves ketamine is responsible for the lack of depression. The release and the study it’s based on stand on a very shaky foundation.
The release’s only nod to caution about the findings is an acknowledgement that the effect of ketamine on depression could be due to an “unidentified” factor. But it does not mention the problems with this retrospective, data-mining study, the main one being that the absence of a symptom (depression) does not equate to the drug alleviating the symptom. No mention is made of the fact that the data were not collected for the purpose for which the researchers used them or the fact that there are no medical histories attached to the subjects included in the study.

The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.\n\nThey focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.\n\n“The entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain’s memory mainframe,” Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain’s chief memory center.\n\nFor the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.\n\n“When we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,” Fried said.\n\nCompared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.\n\nIMPACT ON ALZHEIMER’S\n\nIn Alzheimer’s disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.\n\nFried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.\n\n“The question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,” he said. Scientists are increasingly focused on ways to treat the memory-robbing disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.\n\nDespite costly efforts, no drug has been found that can keep Alzheimer’s from progressing, and policymakers are growing increasingly worried about the swelling ranks of dementia patients as the population ages.\n\nSuzanne Haber, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said she was “very excited about the finding,” but she cautioned that the treatment is very invasive, very expensive and unproven in Alzheimer’s patients.\n\nThe Obama administration said on Wednesday it plans to spend an additional $156 million over the next two years to help find an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s.\n\nOne team has already tried deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer’s patients. In a study published in the Annals of Neurology in 2010 researchers tested deep brain stimulation in six patients over the course of a year and found the treatment to be relatively safe. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory.\n\nDr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer’s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics.\n\n“Although the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,” Black wrote.']",As with the ,"This story does a bit better job than the other one we reviewed of describing electrical brain stimulation treatment as it is used in other types of patients, and pointing out that it is “very invasive.” Still, it could have been more specific about the inherent risks. Like the other story, it misses a chance to compare the results of this experiment to the size of the temporary memory boost provided by available drugs.

A new laser device that burrows under the skin is getting praise from some doctors who say it gives more dramatic and longer-lasting results than previous treatments, but others caution that more research is needed.\n\nCellulite is a dimpled, uneven appearance of skin caused by fat underneath. It affects some 85% of women and about 5% of men. Until recently, the main treatments to battle cellulite have been external treatments such as creams and radio-frequency and massage devices. The creams are largely ineffective and the devices have a modest effect that typically lasts about six months, doctors say.\n\nAches & Claims looks at a new laser that burrows under the skin to treat cellulite. Cellulaze cuts fibers under the skin believed to be part of a major cause of the ugly dimpling phenonenom that affects 85% of women. Leslie Yazel has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Cynosure.\n\nA therapy called Cellulaze, which uses a laser machine sold by Cynosure Inc. in Westford, Mass., hit the U.S. market in February. Some doctors say the results are impressive. ""The results are nothing short of remarkable,"" says Los Angeles plastic surgeon Grant Stevens, a clinical professor of surgery at the University of Southern California\'s Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles. Dr. Stevens, who isn\'t affiliated with Cynosure, said he and another doctor in his practice together have treated about 40 patients with Cellulaze.\n\nThe Cellulaze laser machine Cynosure\n\nBased on the published scientific data, Cellulaze is ""promising,"" says Mathew M. Avram, director of the Dermatology Laser & Cosmetic Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. But ""we need more clinical experience before we can make any definitive statements as to the efficacy of the device.""\n\nCellulaze is different from earlier treatments in that it tackles the root causes of cellulite, including thinning skin and connective fibers called septae that are believed to create tension by pulling down the skin, contributing to an uneven appearance, says Gordon H. Sasaki, a clinical professor of plastic surgery at Loma Linda University Medical University Center in Loma Linda, Calif. Dr. Sasaki is a paid consultant to Cynosure.\n\nHow Cellulaze Works: • Tiny incisions are made so a cannula, or tube, can be inserted into the skin. • Local anesthetic is inserted through the cannula. • Laser light through the cannula cuts septae—which scientists say help cause cellulite dimples. The underside of the skin is heated and some small amounts of fat are melted. • Bruises and tiny scars result, but fade with time. • Compression garments recommended to prevent fluid buildup.\n\nCellulaze is done by plastic surgeons in their offices under local anesthetic. It typically costs $5,000 to $7,000 for a bilateral area, such as the thighs, and another $2,500 or more for each additional area. One or more tiny incisions are made so a narrow tube called a cannula can be inserted into the skin. Laser light, delivered through the cannula, cuts the septae and melts small amounts of fat, Dr. Sasaki says. It heats the underside of the skin, which stimulates collagen production and makes skin thicker and more elastic, he adds.\n\nCellulaze leaves tiny scars—about two millimeters long—which fade with time, surgeons say. Typically, compression garments are recommended for at least two or three weeks to prevent fluid buildup. And there will be bruises, so patients typically need to wait three to six weeks before venturing out in a bathing suit, surgeons say.\n\n. Patients typically wait three to six weeks before going out in a bathing suit. Associated Press\n\nThe procedure can cause a buildup of fluid in the area that has been treated, which can last for months and needs to be drained regularly by a doctor.\n\nIn a written statement, Cynosure says ""a few"" patients in early trials had the buildups, called seromas, adding that they need to be drained to prevent infections and other complications. The company says it has since lowered the recommended laser dosage and it isn\'t aware of any seromas since the device hit the U.S. market.\n\nAccording to a company-funded study of 10 women published last year in Aesthetic Surgery Journal, Cellulaze resulted in skin that was 25% thicker after a year. Cellulite reduction was ""good"" to ""excellent"" as graded by physicians.\n\nDr. Sasaki, in data obtained as part of a company-financed trial that has yet to be published, says 80% of 25 patients he treated are still enjoying ""substantial improvement"" two years after the surgery.\n\nLawrence Bass, director of the minimally invasive plastic-surgery program at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York, says the procedure appears to reduce the depth of cellulite dimples. A person with less-pronounced dimples is ""most likely to get a home run"" out of the procedure, says Dr. Bass, who has attended scientific presentations of the data but hasn\'t performed the procedure. But if you have really deep ones, he adds, ""it might not be enough to make the lifestyle change you want to make, such as wearing shorts in the summertime.""\n\nThe cannula Cynosure\n\nIf a deep dimple is still visible, fat can be injected with a syringe later to even it out, Dr. Sasaki says.\n\nAnother new laser treatment both for cellulite and body contouring is i-Lipo, i-Lipo, from Chromogenex Technologies Ltd., South Wales, England. The laser, which hit the U.S. market in December, is noninvasive and involves pads placed externally on the skin. I-Lipo provokes a chemical reaction that breaks down fat into its components, says company clinical manager Donna Freeman. After the treatment, a cardiovascular workout of 30 to 40 minutes is recommended to burn off the components.\n\nThe ""Ultra"" model of the device comes with a vacuum-massage device aimed at smoothing cellulite, but the effects on cellulite haven\'t yet been tested in a clinical trial, the company says. A 34-patient study, unpublished, found eight 20-minute sessions with the device reduced midsection size by 1.8 inches, measured by a tape measure, compared with only a third of an inch for a sham therapy, which looked the same to patients.\n\nDr. Bass says he is ""skeptical"" because measuring-tape data has a large margin of error. Chromogenex says the measurements used scientifically accepted standards.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com']","Disease-mongering.  Failure to evaluate the laughably limited data that were cited.  Failure to quantify benefits or harms in a meaningful way.  Enough said?  If not, read on.","For a column entitled “Aches & Claims,” this entry caused us many aches because it didn’t adequately evaluate claims, such as:

Try a Whole-Body Scan Procedure gives far more data than a body-mass index,"['The Ache: The bathroom scale shows how much you’ve gained or lost in pounds, but gives no information about whether the change is fat or muscle.\n\nThe Claim: A whole-body scan, called Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, or DXA for short, gives a detailed snapshot of your body composition, including how your body weight breaks down into fat, bone and lean tissue.\n\nThe Verdict: The whole-body scan is highly accurate compared with most other methods for determining body composition, scientists say, and it is useful for tracking progress over time.\n\nBody-mass index, calculated using height and weight, is widely used as a measure of being overweight, but it “doesn’t tell the whole story,” says Steven R. Goldstein, co-director of the Bone Densitometry and Body Composition unit at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York. In an abstract of a 50-person study presented in October at the annual meeting of the North American Menopause Society, researchers found that 18.5% of the women with normal BMI actually had significant excess fat as measured on DXA, making them “skinny fat” people, says Dr. Goldstein, who co-wrote the paper. Also, some women flagged by BMI as overweight actually had normal levels of fat, he says.\n\nFor people trying to lose fat and gain muscle through diet, exercise and resistance training, the X-ray scan “takes the guesswork” out figuring how well you’re doing, says Param Dedhia, a physician at Canyon Ranch, a spa in Tucson, Ariz., that offers the scans. Clients typically get the scans between three months and two years apart to measure progress, he says.\n\nA DXA scan (pronounced dexa) is commonly used to measure bone density, but recently has been increasingly used to measure body composition. The scan takes three to 12 minutes, depending on the type of machine and your body size.\n\nThe cost, $45 to $350 or more, generally isn’t covered by insurance. It is available at a growing number of spas, hospitals and doctor’s offices, says Tom Webb, global product marketing manager, body-composition, for General Electric Co. ’s GE Healthcare unit, which makes two popular scanners.\n\nAfter the scan, you get a report with the mass of your bones, fat and lean tissue (including organs and muscle) broken out individually. Your body-fat percentage is also listed and can be compared with reference values for Americans. The report also shows the amount of fat and lean tissue in each body part, such as the right arm or left leg—information that can be helpful for athletes to see if an injured limb is regaining muscle, says John A. Shepherd, director of the Body Composition, Exercise Physiology and Energy Metabolism laboratory at the University of California at San Francisco.\n\nBoth of GE’s machines, the Lunar iDXA and Lunar Prodigy, and Hologic’s Horizon DXA estimate how much visceral fat you have, a measure that can help predict risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, says Dr. Shepherd, whose lab has received research funding from both companies. (Dr. Shepherd also worked as principal scientist at Hologic from 1996 to 1999 but has no direct financial relationship currently, he says.)\n\nAmong methods now available for measuring body composition, DXA “would rank among the top,” says Dympna Gallagher, director of the body composition laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. It is more accurate than water weighing, long used by researchers to estimate body-fat mass, and more reliable than bioimpedance, a method found on some home scales, and pinching a fold of skin with calipers, she adds.\n\nDXA is reliable when measuring progress over time, Dr. Shepherd says. It is important to use the same model of machine when comparing scans, as results vary slightly among them.\n\nGE Healthcare’s Lunar iDXA system for whole-body scans. Photo: GE Healthcare\n\nA 2013 study published in the Journal of Clinical Densitometry by researchers at USCF and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only small differences when the same 600 people were scanned and rescanned between three and 51 days later. For fat mass, for example, the machine was precise within about a pound in either direction.\n\nScanning too often will show incremental changes and the results won’t be meaningful, says British researcher Susan Hopkins a lecturer in medical imaging at the University of Exeter Medical School.\n\nHow often to scan depends on how fast you are making progress. An obese person on a crash diet might see a large change worth measuring fairly soon, for example, while an elderly person slowly building muscle mass through resistance training might progress slowly, and therefore need less frequent scans, Dr. Hopkins says.\n\nDXA scans involve a small amount of radiation, generally between less than 1 and 10 microsieverts, Dr. Shepherd says. That is only a fraction of a chest X-ray, which ranges from 50 to 150 microsieverts, or a mammogram, at about 400, and is about the same as one day of background radiation, he says.\n\nWrite to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nAn earlier version of the chart on median body fat percentages contained incorrect figures.']",This story checked most of our boxes but still felt inadequate — a missed opportunity to critically examine the use of a health technology that doesn’t seem to offer much tangible benefit.,"A DXA body composition scan featured in the Wall Street Journal.
The format of this story — with its hepful “Ache, Claim, Verdict” structure — suggests we are going to be treated to a no-nonsense examination of the evidence supporting dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, for whole body scans to determine an individual’s body composition in terms of fat, bone and muscle. However, the story doesn’t deliver much more than a superficial look at the technology and is lacking in critical perspective. The story concludes that DXA is much more accurate than body mass index (BMI) at calculating someone’s body composition, but doesn’t give readers much information on why this may be important to their health. It focuses on the question of how often one should get scanned, and never challenges the assumption that one needs to get scanned at all. It doesn’t mention that there appears to be no data to show that those who use these scans have any better outcomes than those who do not.

These tests might tell,"['(CNN) -- Most heart attacks strike with no warning, but doctors now have a clearer picture than ever before of who is most likely to have one, says Dr. Arthur Agatston, a Miami cardiologist and author of the best-selling South Beach diet books.\n\nAgatston says relatively new imaging tests give real-time pictures showing whether plaque is building up in key blood vessels, alerting doctor and patient to an increased risk of a potentially deadly heart attack.\n\n""Unless you do the imaging, you are really playing Russian roulette with your life,"" he said.\n\nAgatston invented one of the imaging tests, the coronary calcium scan, which looks at plaque in the arteries leading to the heart. Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)\n\nThe other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.\n\nAmerican Heart Association: Learn and live\n\nBoth tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.\n\nOne large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the ""good"" cholesterol.\n\nAgatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.\n\nMost hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.\n\nCardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.\n\nHigh-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don\'t think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.\n\n""There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,"" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University\n\nA good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.\n\n""Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?"" she asked.\n\nA calcium score would answer that question, she says.\n\nThere\'s a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient\'s LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.\n\n""There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don\'t get into the vessel wall,"" Agatston says.\n\nThese new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.\n\n""One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices.

Good news for the millions of people who suffer from skin wounds that won’t heal. A team of researchers at The Ohio State University has brought a potentially transformative solution to the problem by creating a portable adhesive patch that drives a continuous, small electrical current to stimulate healing and reduce the risk of infection.\n\nNearly 7 million Americans have chronic wounds – typically a result of diabetes, obesity or other conditions that impact circulation – costing the healthcare system nearly $25 billion each year. The non-healing wounds are painful, can permanently damage nerves, prevent mobility and in extreme cases, cause infection that can lead to death.\n\nThe patch’s design significantly advances existing FDA-approved wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) that harnesses the body’s innate response to injury to help wounds heal.\n\n“A wound naturally produces its own electrical fields that help reduce bacteria and promote cell regeneration; however, this function is likely impaired in chronic wounds,” said Sashwati Roy, PhD, an Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at Ohio State’s College of Medicine. “The prototype dressing mimics this physiological process, and while it has proven to create an optimal environment where chronic wounds can heal, we are always looking for new ways to keep pathogens under better control.”\n\nRoy notes that chronic wounds are particularly susceptible to infection because bacteria, which at times are free floating within a wound – can sometimes mobilize, creating colonies covered by a thick sticky coating called a biofilm. The immune system cannot penetrate the biofilm, and antibiotics can’t get in either – causing constant inflammation and low-level infection that can further dampen the healing process.\n\nNow, with support from Ohio State’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), researchers from both the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine are taking the technology to the next level. Working with a mechanical and aerospace engineering team led by Shaurya Prakash, PhD and Vish Subramaniam, PhD, the scientists have optimized the bandage’s design and the amount of electrical current delivered. Like present WEDs, the new prototype is flexible, portable and self-contained. Made of silk and silver, the experimental dressing includes a self-contained battery that delivers a continuous, safe, low-level electrical current to the injury. “We’re hoping this new design may allow electric fields and currents to penetrate more deeply into wounds, and really get to where these biofilms may be hiding,” said Subramaniam, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Ohio State. “The destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria, reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body’s natural immune response to work more effectively. Bacteria are known to quickly acquire resistance against antibiotics, but to our knowledge, bacteria do not develop resistance against electroceuticals.” To test the experimental design, Roy and a team of scientists developed an animal model to mimic the skin function of a person suffering from metabolic syndrome – obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar - which mirrors the type of patient that typically develops chronic wounds. Animal models had skin injuries infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Acinetobacter baumannii, three different types of bacteria that commonly infect wounds and develop biofilms that are treatment resistant.\n\nEarly results, which were presented at the Wound Healing Society’s Annual Meeting in April 2016 indicate that infected wounds covered by the experimental bioelectric dressing healed better and more quickly than those covered with a plain dressing that is commonly used in the care of wounds today. Scientists hypothesize that the electrical currents may disrupt bacteria in two ways: by interrupting the production of chemical messages that instruct bacteria to develop biofilms and by weakening the molecular structure of existing biofilms, potentially making them more susceptible to antibiotics or the body’s natural immune response. The team’s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population; however, the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries. Roy also notes that the U. S. Department of Defense is very interested in the dressing as a temporary measure to help prevent infection in soldiers wounded on the battle front.\n\n“This technology has a long shelf life and is compact enough to be put into any field medical kit. It could be applied immediately to wounds help keep bacteria from mobilizing and start promoting healing until the soldier could be transported to a facility for more intensive medical care.”\n\nThe team already has interest from several industry partners, and is hoping to begin testing the new technology in patients before the end of the year to determine optimal treatment duration and more about the healing effects of electrical fields on skin cells on a molecular level.\n\nRoy’s research team includes Shomita S. Steiner, PhD; Shaurya Prakash, PhD; Gayle Gordillo, MD; Vish Subramaniam, PhD and Chandan K. Sen, PhD.# # #\n\nThe Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (UL1TR001070, KL2TR001068, TL1TR001069) The CTSA program is led by the NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).

This release describes research involving a specialized bandage that directs electrical stimulation to tissue to promote  healing of chronic wounds. Researchers state that the electric field disturbs the ability of some bacteria to develop biofilms which can hamper wound healing and thwart antibiotics. Such bandages would be a boon to patients with problems of chronic wound healing, according to researchers.

The release would have benefited from information on the cost of the bandages, a summary of potential harms, and more quantification of benefits and description of the evidence. Another short-coming was the lack of transparency about the latest research in relationship to previous work funded by a WED manufacturer and Ohio State researchers, who also led this study.

The story covers cost and availability and usefully points out that this test hasn’t been approved for kids.
But the lead gets it wrong when it says the test is designed to “help detect concussion”; it’s not. The test is designed to detect structural brain injuries that might be picked up by a CT scan, such as skull fractures or bleeding in the brain.
The story also doesn’t address uncertainties with the quality of evidence or potential harms. Finally, it misses an opportunity to educate the public about the need for more judicious use of CT scans, which are not helpful for detecting concussions.

Hall, M.D., M.Div., M.H.Sc., of the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System and University of Pittsburgh, and colleagues examined the effect of a Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) on death and complications by comparing the surgical outcomes of patients treated before and after implementation of the FSI.\n\nAs the U.S. population ages, the number of operations performed on elderly patients will likely increase. Frailty predicts postoperative mortality and illness more than age alone, thus presenting opportunities to identify the highest-risk surgical patients and provide tailored clinical care to improve their outcomes. This study included 9,153 patients (average age, 60 years) from a Veterans Affairs medical center who presented for major, elective, noncardiac surgery. Preoperative frailty was assessed with the Risk Analysis Index (RAI; a 14-item questionnaire), and the records of all frail patients (as determined by a certain RAI score) were flagged for administrative review by the chief of surgery (or designee) before the scheduled operation. On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient’s frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input.\n\nThe researchers found that overall 30-day mortality decreased from 1.6 percent (84 of 5,275 patients) to 0.7 percent (26 of 3,878 patients) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2 percent to 3.8 percent), although mortality rates also decreased among the robust patients (1.2 percent to 0.3 percent). The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180 and 365 days.\n\n“The ultimate cause of the survival benefit is likely multifactorial, including changes in preoperative decision making, intraoperative management, and postoperative rescue,” the authors write.\n\n“This study reveals the feasibility of facility-wide frailty screening in elective surgical populations. It also suggests the potential to improve postoperative survival among the frail through systematic administrative screening, review, and optimization of perioperative plans. The absolute reduction in 180-day mortality among frail patients was more than 19 percent, with improvement remaining robust even after controlling for age, frailty, and predicted mortality.”\n\n(JAMA Surgery.

The vegetarian diet consisted of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and nuts, with animal products limited to a maximum of one portion of low-fat yoghurt per day; the conventional diabetic diet followed the official recommendations of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Both diets were restricted by 500 kilocalories per day compared to an isocaloric intake for each individual.\n\nThe vegetarian diet was found to be almost twice as effective in reducing body weight, resulting in an average loss of 6.2kg compared to 3.2kg for the conventional diet.\n\nUsing magnetic resonance imaging, Dr. Kahleová and colleagues then studied adipose (fat-storage) tissue in the subjects\' thighs to see how the two different diets had affected subcutaneous, subfascial and intramuscular fat (that is, fat under the skin, on the surface of muscles and inside muscles).\n\nThey found that both diets caused a similar reduction in subcutaneous fat. However, subfascial fat was only reduced in response to the vegetarian diet, and intramuscular fat was more greatly reduced by the vegetarian diet.\n\nThis is important as increased subfascial fat in patients with type 2 diabetes has been associated with insulin resistance, so reducing it could have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism. In addition, reducing intramuscular fat could help improve muscular strength and mobility, particularly in older people with diabetes.\n\nDr. Kahleová said: ""Vegetarian diets proved to be the most effective diets for weight loss. However, we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat, thus improving metabolism. This finding is important for people who are trying to lose weight, including those suffering from metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes.

She presented results of the study at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics medical conference in Denver; results were simultaneously published online Thursday by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Al-Lamee cautioned that the findings apply to a minority of the population of patients who now receive stents, those with narrowing of only one artery and certain other characteristics. She said the study doesn’t apply to patients having heart attacks, who may benefit from stents, and to patients with chest pain who have disease in more than one artery.\n\nThe study also found that stents improved blood supply to the heart versus placebo, she said.\n\nStill, the study could affect a portion of a multibillion business for stent manufacturers including Medtronic PLC, Abbott Laboratories and Boston Scientific Corp. About 500,000 stents are implanted for stable angina each year world-wide, the study’s researchers wrote in The Lancet.\n\nAbbott spokesman Jonathon Hamilton said the new study had patients with mild disease “who weren’t reflective of patients who typically undergo stenting procedures,” and that some patients received stents in the trial who wouldn’t have gotten them otherwise because of the study design.\n\nMedtronic and Boston Scientific all referred questions about the study to a statement issued Thursday by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, whose members include cardiologists who perform stent procedures. The SCAI said it questioned the study’s conclusions, and that SCAI believes stents are the preferred treatment for cardiac patients who need more than medicines to improve health and quality of life.\n\nBut some doctors said the study’s outcome should discourage use of stents in many patients.\n\nThe results show “unequivocally” that there are no benefits for stent procedures compared with drugs for stable angina, two cardiologists wrote in an editorial accompanying the results in The Lancet.\n\nThe cardiologists, David L. Brown of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Rita F. Redberg of University of California, San Francisco, called for cardiology-treatment guidelines to downgrade the recommendation of stents for stable chest pain, and focus on treating these patients with medicine.\n\nPast studies have proven that stents can save lives when used in acute situations like heart attacks. But other studies have challenged their uses in patients with less severe disease and symptoms, including a landmark study released in 2007. Changes to treatment guidelines since then have curbed the over-use of stent procedures, according to a 2015 study .\n\nWhile the new study’s findings are being debated, it is notable for its design: It is the first to compare stents with placebo while keeping patients in the dark about whether or not they received a stent. All patients had catheters inserted in an artery and were heavily sedated before being taken into a catheter lab. But only about half were given actual stents, while the rest were left on cath-lab tables for about 15 minutes, then had the catheters removed.\n\nResearchers chose this design to minimize the “placebo effect” seen in past studies, in which a portion of symptom improvement in patients receiving stents could be attributed to their expectation that the stent would make them feel better.\n\nAll patients in the study took drugs including aspirin, anti-platelet drugs, cholesterol-lowering statins and beta blockers for about six weeks. This was followed by baseline treadmill tests and either the stent or sham procedure. They underwent treadmill tests again six weeks after the procedures. Researchers used exercise time as the main measure because physical exertion is usually what triggers angina, and it usually goes away when patients rest, Dr. Al-Lamee said.\n\nPatients receiving stents improved their exercise times by an average of 28 seconds, while those who didn’t improved their times by an average of nearly 12 seconds. But the difference wasn’t statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance.\n\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com']",A robust discussion of what the study measured was a strong point of this story.,"This Wall Street Journal story describes surprising news that a very common procedure– inserting a stent to open a blocked blood vessel — does not add benefit over medication in patients with angina. Angina is chest pain due to blocked heart arteries, and is common among people with heart disease.
One strength of the story is the detailed description of the study itself and in finding outside sources to critique aspects of the study. We do think the cost of the procedure was worth discussion, as well as the potential harms, but they were not addressed in this story. These points were raised in the New York Times story, which we also reviewed.

Topical treatments are available for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but there has a lack of long-term follow-up data to guide treatment decisions. A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n\nMore than 80% of all skin cancers are BCC, arising from the basal cells (i.e., small, round cells found in the lower layer of the epidermis). There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. The prognosis is excellent, but it can cause significant disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues.\n\nWhile most types of BCC require surgery, superficial BCC can be treated topically with noninvasive treatments such as PDT, imiquimod cream, fluorouracil cream, cryosurgery or electrodessication and curettage.\n\nInvestigators in the Netherlands report the results of a three-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial that compared three noninvasive treatments that included imiquimod and fluorouracil cream. ""The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams,"" explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. ""Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices.""\n\nHowever, prior to this study there has been a lack of randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up that compare the effectiveness of noninvasive treatments. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC.\n\nA total of 601 patients with a superficial BCC participated in this study: 202 patients were treated with methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), 198 with imiquimod cream, and 201 with fluorouracil cream. The three study groups had a similar distribution of baseline characteristics, with the exception of tumor size.\n\nAround 80% of patients with superficial BCC were tumor free after imiquimod treatment after three years. The clearance rate was 68% for patients treated with fluorouracil and 58% for individuals receiving PDT.\n\n""Based on our findings, both imiquimod and fluorouracil are effective noninvasive treatments in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, but the data provide no definite evidence for superiority of imiquimod to fluorouracil,"" commented Dr. Roozeboom. ""Both creams have an equal cosmetic outcome and risk of local adverse events. Fluorouracil has the advantage of being less expensive than imiquimod. However, between one- and three-year follow-up, more recurrences were diagnosed in the fluorouracil group compared with the imiquimod group.""\n\n""When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account. For example, we have found that in superficial BCC on the lower extremities in older patients, PDT should be prescribed rather than imiquimod. Our evidence indicates that a personalized treatment approach is necessary,"" added Dr. Roozeboom.\n\n###\n\nNotes for editors\n\n""Three year follow-up results of photodynamic therapy versus imiquimod versus fluorouracil for treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma: a single blind, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial,"" by Marieke H.

But only about 10 percent of smokers ever develop lung cancer, although they often die of other causes like heart disease, stroke or emphysema.\n\nSeparately, Italian researchers reported that advanced lung cancer patients given the targeted therapy drug Tarceva as so-called maintenance treatment — after they finished a course of standard chemotherapy — lived a little bit longer.\n\nFederico Cappuzzo from Ospedale Civile di Livorno in Italy and colleagues did a phase 3 trial in 889 patients who had already had chemotherapy and whose tumors had not come back.\n\nThey received either Tarceva, a drug sold by Roche and OSI Pharmaceuticals and known generically as erlotinib, or a placebo until they got worse or died.\n\nThe patients who got Tarceva lived a little longer without their tumors growing — 12 weeks versus 11 weeks on average and they lived a month longer on average — 12 months versus 11 months.\n\nThis was seen even among patients who did not have the EGFR genetic mutation that Tarceva targets, they reported in Lancet Oncology.\n\nFewer than half of all lung cancer patients who do well after a first course of chemotherapy get more treatment, but the Italian group said their study shows this is worth doing.']",It’s ironic that on the same day the executive editor of one arm of Reuters ,"Does the pressure to meet a certain volume or quota of stories force some news organizations to feel they must report on abstracts and news briefings from medical/scientific meetings?  If so, we suggest that a paradigm shift is in order.  Read the full review to see why.

The operation was performed as part of a clinical trial at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\n\nThe surgery is called NOTES -- which stands for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery. The idea is to use the mouth or vagina as routes to parts of the body requiring surgery. In traditional laparoscopic -- or minimally invasive -- surgery, doctors make several small incisions through the abdominal wall and insert a tiny camera and tools to remove the gallbladder or appendix. That type of surgery is a big improvement upon the long, open incisions that patients used to require.\n\nHowever, NOTES spares patients even the tiny abdominal incisions. Tools are passed down the mouth and through a hole created in the stomach. In the recent surgery, lead investigator Santiago Horgan made two tiny incisions (not requiring stitches) to pass a camera into the abdomen to increase visibility. However, the gallbladder was removed by way of the mouth.\n\nThe procedure was done as part of a study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of NOTES compared with laparoscopy as well as the pain levels, cosmetic outcome, costs and other outcomes, Horgan said in a news release.

It\'s only been implanted in a few dozen people who were studied for a matter of months, limiting information about its long-term use and safety. It\'s also not clear when the pacemaker may be publicly available, and its cost is unknown. And the existing version of the device won\'t work for most pacemaker patients because it lacks some key features.\n\nStill, a new company-funded study shows that ""this is now a possibility"" that could reduce infections and the severity of pacemaker surgery, said study author Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. ""This is going to be the future,"" he said.\n\nPacemakers zap the heart with low levels of electricity when the heartbeat becomes too fast, too slow or too irregular. Some are combined with defibrillators, which give the heart a major jolt when needed.\n\nCurrently, pacemakers include two components: a battery-powered generator that produces the electrical ""prompts"" that the wires deliver to the heart when needed, Reddy said. These wires can break or become infected, he explained, making the idea of a wire-free pacemaker appealing.\n\nThe new pacemaker is about the size of a AAA battery and provides jolts to one chamber of the heart, Reddy said. Most people with pacemakers require jolts to both chambers, so the pacemaker in its current form wouldn\'t work for them.\n\nIn the new study, researchers implanted the pacemaker in 32 people for the first time through a puncture in the skin; in 10 patients, they had to reposition it. The researchers reported positive results at up to three months. However, one patient died of a stroke while convalescing after suffering a heart injury during implantation and another had the pacemaker replaced with a defibrillator.\n\nWhy get a wire-free pacemaker? ""For patients with heart problems, this could potentially mean fewer infections related to leads and less discomfort during the implant procedure,"" Reddy said. And children who get pacemakers wouldn\'t face chest scarring, he added.\n\nDr. Saman Nazarian, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said the findings are promising and ""the new technology has enormous potential."" He expects the pacemaker ""will likely be utilized for some select patients"" after more testing.\n\nStill, he said, the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers, and may pose special risks of its own.\n\nDr. Harish Doppalapudi, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, added that there are unanswered questions regarding replacement of the new pacemakers.\n\n""When the battery of the implanted leadless pacemaker is exhausted, a new implant is necessary, with all the potential risks associated with this,"" Doppalapudi said. ""It is not known if it will be feasible to safely retrieve the old device. If the old device is left in place, it is not known what the long-term effects of this will be.""\n\nStudy author Reddy has received grant funding from Nanostim, and works for the company as a consultant. He also has received stock options from the company.\n\nThe study was to be presented Wednesday at the Heart Rhythm Society annual meeting in Denver. Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about pacemakers, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","While this story adequately addressed 7 of our 10 criteria, the 3 on which it missed were significant omissions, yet could have been easily addressed.","Strong points:  appropriate caveats about the limitations of this early stage of testing, amplified by input from independent experts.

SCIENTISTS DISCOVER ANTIBODY THAT REDUCES BODY FAT IN MICE,"['A treatment for obesity could be on the horizon as scientists have discovered an antibody that reduces body fat.\n\nIn trials on mice, the antibody was found to increase bone mass and reduce adipose tissue (fat)—and while human studies are some way off, the findings could lead to new treatments for weight loss and osteoporosis.\n\nThe antibody discovered targets follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) found in the pituitary gland. Ten years ago, scientists started looking at the hormones made in the pituitary gland to see how they act on certain targets. They found some of these hormones had an effect on bone mass.\n\nSubscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week\n\nMatt Cardy/Getty\n\nFrom this, they created an antibody to see if it could be used to prevent bone loss in mice—and in 2010, they showed it could. As a result, they started considering it as a potential treatment for osteoporosis, particularly in post-menopausal women—a period when women lose bone mass fairly quickly.\n\nBut scientists also realized it could have other uses. Mone Zaidi, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, is one of the authors on the latest study into how the antibody triggers weight loss. “Osteoporosis and obesity are fairly closely linked in several ways,” he tells Newsweek. “Women, when they undergo menopause, lose bone and gain body fat. So we thought maybe there was a connection—that FSH could have direct effects on adipose tissue.”\n\nIn the study, published in Nature, scientists injected the antibody into mice that had had their ovaries removed (mimicking menopause) and mice that had been fed on a high-fat diet. In both cases, the antibody caused significant weight loss and gains in bone mass.\n\nZaidi says they looked at the adipose tissue in different areas of the body, including under the skin and around the vital organs. “In all compartments it was [fat] reduced by around this level. It’s a fairly dramatic effect.” Mice also showed increased oxygen consumption, higher levels of physical activity and more heat production in beige fat (which dissipates energy around the body).\n\nBut how do mice models translate to human treatments? Mice a fairly close genetic match to Humans, and Zaidi is hopeful there will be similar effects in humans.\n\nTheir next step is to “humanize” the antibody, so it can be tested without triggering an immune response. “We would then hopefully go to the next phase of preclinical testing, which would be to look at side effects, toxicology etc. After that, we would go into primates and larger animals. That would then lead—if all goes well—to the first human trials in three to four years.”\n\nAt present, the researchers are focusing on the adiposity, rather than bone loss, for drug development: “I think obesity is a more prevalent disease—but osteoporosis at the tail end can be tagged on. Also to do trials for osteoporosis takes a very long time,” Zaidi says.\n\nEventually, he hopes to end up with an injected drug that gets rid of fat and increases bone mass. “That’s the ideal situation,” he says. “It could be a unique obesity drug. But it could also be a unique drug because it lowers body fat and makes bones stronger. And the population that could be most benefited by this could be post-menopausal women.”\n\nCommenting on the research, Tim Speckor, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London, U.K., says: “It’s a nice mouse study that seems to work—whether it works in humans is another matter.”']",The story does not tell readers that the researcher who is quoted in the story has filed a provisional patent for the antibody.,"The story focuses on a study recently published in Nature, in which researchers reported being able to reduce body fat and increase bone mass in mice by injecting them with a specific antibody.
The story makes clear that this research was done in rodents and therefore is years away (at best) from even beginning clinical trials in humans. But if a story is going to discuss the potential benefits, such as this one does, it has a responsibility to place the work in context by touching on issues related to the quality of the evidence, conflicts of interest and potential adverse health effects — even if only to say that no one knows what those adverse effects may be in humans.

Both analyze multiple genes in a biopsy sample and give a score for aggressiveness, similar to tests used now for certain breast and colon cancers.\n\nDoctors say tests like these have the potential to curb a major problem in cancer care — overtreatment. Prostate tumors usually grow so slowly they will never threaten a man\'s life, but some prove fatal and there is no reliable way now to tell which ones will. Treatment with surgery, radiation or hormone blockers isn\'t needed in most cases and can cause impotence or incontinence, yet most men are afraid to skip it.\n\n""We\'re not giving patients enough information to make their decision,"" said Dr. Peter Carroll, chairman of urology at the University of California, San Francisco. ""You can shop for a toaster"" better than for prostate treatment, he said.\n\nA study he led of the newest test — the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score — is set for discussion Wednesday at an American Urological Association meeting in San Diego.\n\nThe results suggest the test could triple the number of men thought to be at such low risk for aggressive disease that monitoring is a clearly safe option. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed.\n\nIndependent experts say such a test is desperately needed but that it\'s unclear how much information this one adds or whether it will be enough to persuade men with low-risk tumors to forgo treatment, and treat it only if it gets worse. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now.\n\n""The question is, what\'s the magnitude of difference that would change the patient\'s mind?"" said Dr. Bruce Roth, a cancer specialist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nOne man may view a 15 percent chance that his tumor is aggressive as low risk ""but someone else might say, \'Oh my God, let\'s set the surgery up tomorrow,\'"" he said. ""I don\'t think it\'s a slam dunk.""\n\nAlso unknown: Will insurers pay for the expensive test without evidence it leads to better care or saves lives?\n\nThe newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. Doctors at first were leery of it until studies in more groups of women proved its value, and the same may happen with the prostate test, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society\'s deputy chief medical officer.\n\nThe company will charge $3,820 for the prostate test and says it can save money by avoiding costlier, unnecessary treatment. Another test for assessing prostate cancer risk that came out last summer — Prolaris by Myriad Genetics Inc. — sells for $3,400.\n\nBoth companies can sell the tests without Food and Drug Administration approval under separate rules that govern lab diagnostics. Myriad Genetics has published nine studies on Prolaris involving more than 3,000 patients. Genomic Health has not published any results on the prostate test, another thing that makes doctors wary. Yet it has a track record from its breast cancer test.\n\nAbout 240,000 men in the U.S. are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and about half are classified as low risk using current methods. Doctors now base risk estimates on factors such as a man\'s age and how aggressive cells look from biopsies that give 12 to 14 tissue samples. But tumors often are spread out and vary from one spot to the other.\n\n""Unless you can be sure your biopsy has hit the most aggressive part that\'s in the prostate, you can\'t be sure"" how accurate your risk estimate is, explained Dr. Eric Klein, chief of urology at the Cleveland Clinic, who led early development of the Oncotype prostate cancer test.\n\nFor one study, researchers used prostates removed from 440 men. They measured the activity of hundreds of genes thought to be involved in whether the cancer spread beyond the prostate or proved fatal. A second study of biopsies from 167 patients narrowed it down to 81 genes, and researchers picked 17 that seemed to predict aggressiveness no matter the location in the tumor.\n\nA third study used single needle-biopsy samples from 395 UCSF patients scheduled to have their prostates removed. The gene test accurately predicted the aggressiveness of their cancer once doctors were able to see the whole prostate after surgery.\n\nUsing one current method, 37 of the 395 men would have been called very low risk and good candidates for monitoring. Adding the gene test put 100 men into that category, said another study leader, Dr. Matthew Cooperberg of UCSF. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.\n\n""It went both ways — that was the remarkable thing. In any category of risk it added independent information compared to the standard criteria we use today,"" Carroll said. ""More work needs to be done, but, in my opinion, this is a very good start.""\n\nHowever, Dr. Kevin McVary, chairman of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and a spokesman for the Urological Association, said the test must be validated in more men before it can be widely used.\n\n""It\'s not there yet,"" he said.\n\nUCSF just got a federal grant to see how men choose treatments and whether this test might sway them.\n\n""We throw all these numbers at them. Are they really going to make a better decision?"" Cooperberg said.\n\nDean Smith, 60, a retired marketing executive from Mill Valley, Calif., is following his doctor\'s advice to monitor the cancer he was diagnosed with in March. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.\n\nAt least six of his friends suffered side effects ranging from urinary leakage to inability to have sex after having their prostates removed.\n\n""I would suspect that having cancer and having to live with it would be very difficult for them,"" but it doesn\'t bother him, Smith said. ""I will die from something other than prostate cancer, I guarantee you.""']","Solid medical conference reporting, with many expert interviews and good context provided.  Goes far beyond the conference presentation itself.","The story employed very careful presentation of both the promise and the potential limitations of two new prostate cancer gene tests.
Until recently, the PSA test was routinely used as a screening instrument for prostate cancer resulting in millions of men suddenly facing a set of interesting choices.  If the PSA is elevated, should a biopsy be performed?  If so, how reliable is the Gleason scoring system in predicting the risk of spread and death? Because of uncertainty, many men undergo potentially needless surgical procedures rather than perhaps watchful waiting.  A new and potentially more reliable test to determine the aggressiveness of the tumor type in concert with a Gleason score or as a replacement would be welcomed.  A reliable predictive test of risk of death from prostate cancer would add considerably to the decision process.

As part of the condition, they also have lower levels of acetylcholine, a chemical which helps us to concentrate - making it extremely difficult to pay attention to walking.\n\n""We already know that rivastigmine works to treat dementia by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, however our study shows for the first time that it can also improve regularity of walking, speed, and balance. This is a real breakthrough in reducing the risk of falls for people with Parkinson\'s.""\n\nDr Henderson and her team at the University of Bristol studied 130 people with Parkinson\'s who had fallen in the past year. Half the group were given rivastigmine capsules and the other half a placebo for an eight month period.\n\nDr Arthur Roach, Director of Research at Parkinson\'s UK, which funded the study said:\n\n""People affected by Parkinson\'s, their carers, and health and social care professionals have said that preventing falls and improving balance is the biggest unmet need for people living with the condition, other than finding a cure.\n\n""Things that may be simple to us, such as walking upstairs or getting up in the middle of the night to get a glass of water, or go to the toilet, are much harder and more dangerous when you could easily fall. You risk breaking bones and then needing an emergency hospital admission.\n\n""This trial shows that there may be drugs already available, being used for other purposes, that can be tested to help treat Parkinson\'s. This takes us a step closer to improving the quality of life and finding better treatments for people with Parkinson\'s.""\n\nCaroline Maxwell from Northamptonshire, a participant on the study, who was diagnosed with Parkinson\'s 13 years ago said:\n\n""A few years ago, I had a bad fall while carrying my sewing machine across the room, leaving me in hospital for a week and really denting my confidence.\n\n""I\'m at the stage where I would walk much better with a replacement joint, but because I fall so frequently my surgeon is reluctant to operate. Falling on my replacement hip would put in an even worse situation than what I\'m in now.\n\n""By potentially finding a treatment that helps to prevent falls, I\'d be able to get a replacement hip and have the confidence to go shopping on my own, without having to constantly rely on the goodness of strangers to pick me up when I fell.""\n\n###\n\nFor more information on Parkinson\'s UK research, and to donate, visit parkinsons.org.uk/research.\n\nFor media and interview enquiries:\n\nHanna Kilpin, Senior Media & PR Officer - Research, Parkinson\'s UK: hkilpin@parkinsons.org.uk 020 7963 9311.

That typically happens to people with the mysterious illness commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Research findings from Stanford University released Monday could point the way to a long-sought diagnostic laboratory test for the condition, and possibly a first-ever treatment.\n\nBelieved to affect at least a million people in the U.S., the condition is now increasingly termed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS for short.\n\nMany patients see the name ""chronic fatigue syndrome"" as trivializing and misleading, giving the impression that they\'re simply tired or depressed. In fact, they\'re experiencing profound exhaustion that isn\'t relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, ""brain fog"" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. (A 2015 Institute of Medicine report proposed the name ""systemic exertion intolerance disease,"" but it hasn\'t really stuck.)\n\nThe symptoms can range from mild to extremely severe, with about a quarter of patients so ill they\'re mostly or completely confined to bed. Now, the Stanford researchers have linked ME/CFS to variations in certain cytokines, immune-signaling proteins, that track with illness severity. The study results were published online Monday in the the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. The study involved 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Out of 51 cytokines investigated via sophisticated fluorescence-based testing, only two of the cytokines differed, in their total concentrations, between the ME/CFS and control groups.\n\nBut, levels of 17 of the cytokines varied dramatically between the patients with mild versus severe ME/CFS symptoms. Of those 17 cytokines, 13 were types that promote inflammation. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness.\n\n""This is a field that has been full of skepticism and misconception, where patients have been viewed to have invented their disease. These data clearly show the contrary, and demonstrate what can be achieved when we couple good research design with new technology,"" lead author Dr. Jose Montoya, professor of infectious diseases at Stanford, tells Shots.\n\nAccording to Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, a Harvard internist and epidemiologist who has written a commentary to accompany the study, ""For many years medical scientists have speculated that the symptoms of ME/CFS might be caused by cytokines, molecules that the immune system use to wage war against foreign invaders of the body. Past studies have shown high levels of many cytokines but it was not clear that these high levels were causing symptoms.""\n\nWhat the latest research shows, Komaroff tells Shots, is that ""levels of many cytokines do correlate with symptoms: The higher the blood level, the worse the symptoms. That supports the theory that the cytokines are a cause of the symptoms.""\n\nSo why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? Simply put, Montoya says, those tests aren\'t measuring the right things.\n\nTwo classic laboratory measures of inflammation are sedimentation rate — the ability of red blood cells to clump together, which isn\'t a factor in ME/CFS — and C-reactive protein, which reflects levels of a single cytokine that wasn\'t one of those linked to severity in this study.\n\n""Inflammation is much more complicated than two imperfect old measures,"" Montoya says. ""We\'re showing an inflammation that has not been seen before.""\n\nThe multidisciplinary Stanford team is now working on developing a panel that could be used commercially, that would test for around five of the 17 cytokines and would likely involve the doctor first classifying patients by severity in order to interpret the results. Such a test could both establish the diagnosis and serve to monitor patients\' responses to treatment.\n\nWhat\'s more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy. Montoya hopes that by publishing these findings ""a team of researchers somewhere in the world will see these cytokines and say they have the drug for that inflammation. We hope drug companies will pursue it.""\n\nIndeed, a major drug trial is now being conducted in Norway investigating whether the immune-modifying drug rituximab alleviates ME/CFS symptoms, after preliminary studies suggested that it did in some patients. Interestingly, the drug is approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases and also non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that one study found uniquely occurs at a higher rate among older people with ME/CFS.\n\nKomaroff also notes a recent increase in research funding by the National Institutes of Health, which has included a comprehensive in-house study aimed at unraveling the underlying causes of the condition.\n\nAnd in an ongoing privately funded study, Stanford geneticist Ron Davis and a team including three Nobel laureates is taking a similar ""big data"" approach to investigate a group of ME/CFS patients who are all severely ill, including Davis\' own adult son.\n\n""There is much to learn,"" Komaroff writes, in the journal. ""Hopefully, a decade from now, ""doctors will know better what to measure and, more importantly, what to do to ease the suffering caused by this illness.""\n\nMiriam E. Tucker is a freelance journalist specializing in medicine and health. You can follow her on Twitter @MiriamETucker.']","Also, the story talks about work to develop a commercially available test, but there is no discussion of what such a test might cost.","
This story about the potential use of cytokine testing to diagnose and then guide the treatment of chronic fatigue is cautiously worded. It reports that a new study “could point the way.”
Yet even with such careful language, readers are likely to get an inflated sense of what the latest study actually reported, because the story seems to assume that high levels of cytokines are causing CFS/ME and that tracking these levels will help guide treatment. However, the study under discussion, which is observational in nature, is incapable of proving such a relationship. As such, it’s too early to suggest that these lab markers can be used to diagnose the condition or monitor treatment — at least not without the inclusion of strong qualifying language.

The print edition is scheduled to be published in August.\n\nWhile preliminary studies have suggested a link between meditation, a sense of spirituality or faith and the risk of Alzheimer\'s disease, the article\'s author, Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D., states that a cultivation of higher levels of psycho-social well-being, such as independence, resilience and life purpose represents ""an important new frontier that deserves further research as it is freely available to anyone, anytime, anywhere.""\n\nThe article reviews decades of research into the impact that various meditation techniques have had on the prevention of Alzheimer\'s disease, focusing on one evidence-based practice that Khalsa says can be a powerful part of any Alzheimer\'s prevention and spiritual fitness program, Kirtan Kriya (KK), a meditation technique which has been successfully used to improve memory in studies of people with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.\n\nKhalsa\'s article highlights the principles and practices of this 12-minute meditation, with corresponding SPECT scans showing how it successfully activates the posterior cingulate gyrus, an important region of the brain that helps regulate memory and emotional function. The article also summarizes KK\'s associated benefits, including a diminished loss of brain volume with age, significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms, and greater improvement of mental health, well-being and memory.\n\n""We\'ve been studying the impact of meditation on memory for more than 20 years, and are as encouraged as we\'ve ever been on its powerful role in maximizing brain health,"" said Khalsa, president and medical director of the Alzheimer\'s Research and Prevention Foundation and a clinical associate professor of integrative medicine at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. ""Science is showing that meditation and spiritual fitness can be an important dimension in battling Alzheimer\'s, and Kirtan Kriya is a safe, affordable, fast, and effective way to keep the brain spiritually fit.""\n\nThe full text of ""Stress, Meditation, and Alzheimer\'s Prevention: Where the Evidence Stands"" can be accessed at http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad142766.\n\nAbout the Alzheimer\'s Research and Prevention Foundation\n\nThe Alzheimer\'s Research and Prevention Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing the incidence of Alzheimer\'s disease by conducting clinical research and providing educational outreach about the lifestyle changes that can help prevent Alzheimer\'s disease.

But benefits have only been seen in very small, preliminary studies with significant design limitations.","This news release — and the review article on which it’s based — from the Alzheimer’s Research and Prevention Foundation claims that practicing a type of singing meditation called Kirtan Kriya for 12 minutes a day reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and improves the memory of people with mild cognitive impairment. One of the precepts of holistic medicine organizations such as the Foundation is that spirituality and emotions play as big a part in a person’s health as their physical symptoms. While it’s generally accepted that meditation can reduce stress levels in some people, which may in turn lead to better general health and well-being, this news release goes too far in claiming that Kirtan Kriya can improve memory and is a “key component” in reducing Alzheimer’s disease risk. It would take a randomized controlled trial that followed people with no memory impairment or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to see if those practicing meditation developed Alzheimer’s less frequently than those who did not. Such a trial has not been done. The major risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease are age, family history and heredity. The evidence that meditation can reduce these risk factors remains inconclusive.

But I walked out being told they couldn\'t find any cancer cells in my body. When you\'ve already accepted your fate, to have it 180 degrees changed, it\'s unnerving."" - Bill Ludwig, 70, Penn’s first T-cell patient. DAVID MAIALETTI / Staff Photographer\n\nFour years ago, University of Pennsylvania researchers published early but electrifying results. An experimental T-cell therapy eradicated end-stage leukemia in two patients, and put a third in remission. Soon after that, pharmaceutical giant Novartis partnered with Penn, aiming to commercialize the breakthrough. Since then, a more modest picture of success has emerged in treating the blood cancer, a type called chronic lymphocytic leukemia that usually strikes in middle age or later. Of the first 14 CLL patients given the T-cell therapy, four had their cancers disappear - including the first two, who are now about five years cancer-free. Four others got better but then their cancer progressed. And six had no response to the T-cell therapy.\n\nIn addition to those results, published last week in Science Translational Medicine, the Penn team has orally presented data for a total of 38 CLL patients.\n\nCancer disappeared in nine (24 percent), and temporarily regressed in another nine.\n\nCLL typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia, and may be held in check for years with chemotherapy.\n\nIn comparison, Penn\'s T-cell therapy has been spectacularly effective in more than 50 children and adults with a fast-progressing type of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Long-lasting, complete remissions have occurred in more than 60 percent of patients.\n\nOther major centers that are developing T-cell therapies, including Memorial Sloan Kettering and the National Cancer Institute, also have found that the approach works far better in ALL than CLL.\n\nThe method is complex and costly, and often triggers life-threatening complications. It involves genetically engineering each patient\'s disease-fighting T cells to recognize and attack their cancer cells.\n\nWhen it works, the therapy also offers the hope of a rarity in terminal-stage cancer: a onetime curative treatment. Stem-cell transplantation, a risky, last-resort treatment that can sometimes be curative, is not a suitable option for most patients with CLL.\n\n""The field of CLL is exploding now,"" said Penn leukemia specialist David L. Porter, the director of blood and bone marrow transplantation. ""At the very limit of this [T-cell] treatment, one could consider it like a stem-cell transplant. It\'s a highly technical approach, but it clearly has a role for a select group of patients. There is something very attractive about a once-and-done therapy.""\n\nWalter J. Urba, director of research at Providence Cancer Center in Portland, Ore., wrote an editorial four years ago cautioning that only wider testing would show whether Penn\'s ""impressive"" initial results were ""an authentic advance"" for CLL.\n\nLast week, Urba said Penn\'s T-cell therapy ""remains very exciting,"" despite the costs and toxic side effects.\n\n""Everything we do in oncology is a risk-benefit balance,"" Urba said. ""I suspect that over time we\'ll have better T-cell therapies, maybe given with other immune therapies.""\n\nIndeed, Penn and other centers have begun testing next-generation T cells in more blood malignancies including lymphomas, and against the ultimate biological challenge - solid tumor cancers.\n\nFor Penn\'s very first T-cell patient, Bill Ludwig, 70, the pace of progress is thrilling, humbling, and yet, a bit of a letdown.\n\nThe retired corrections officer from Bridgeton, N.J., was losing his decadelong battle with CLL when he agreed to try the novel therapy in August 2010.\n\n""I didn\'t hesitate because I had no options left,"" he recalled last week. ""And also, these people at Penn had been so wonderful to me and my family for 10 years. I felt obligated to say yes. Did I ever think it would be successful? Not in a million years.""\n\nHe suffered catastrophic side effects as his immune system went into overdrive and his body struggled to eliminate seven pounds worth of dead cancer cells.\n\n""I was in intensive care, with all my major organs shutting down,"" he said. ""My lower extremities were twice the size they should have been. They called my wife and said, \'He\'s not going to see the sunrise.\' ""\n\nThey were wrong.\n\n""I was a skeleton when I walked out"" a month later, he said. ""But I walked out being told they couldn\'t find any cancer cells in my body. When you\'ve already accepted your fate, to have it 180 degrees changed, it\'s unnerving.""\n\nLudwig and his wife have since bought a recreational vehicle and traveled the country, seen grandchildren graduate high school, and welcomed three great-grandchildren.\n\nStill, he can\'t help feeling disappointed that the phenomenal early success of the therapy was just that.\n\n""When two out of three are successful, you think maybe it will be 9 out of 10, or 19 out of 20. I figured if they can cure me, they can cure everyone.""\n\nHe corrected himself: ""They\'ve never said \'cured.\' But \'cancer-free\' works for me.""\n\nmmccullough@phillynews.com\n\n215-854-2720\n\n@repopter']","We were pleasantly surprised by this story’s ability to inform, despite relying on a single patient’s experience to frame the narrative.","Patient Bill Ludwig is the focus of this story on a leukemia therapy.
Early results of T-cell therapy raised hopes for some leukemia patients, but immunotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia is proving helpful only for a minority of those who receive it. In this story, an early pioneer patient shares the terrifying lows and ultimate high of his journey. While the use of a single patient anecdote in a news story is often a red flag for us, this patient’s perspective is uniquely engaging and informative. Even though he has benefited from the procedure, he details the significant side effects he faced and calls attention to the fact that most others with the disease have not fared as well. It’s not the cheerleading-type narrative that we often see with single-patient-focused stories. Overall the coverage provided a very human story interwoven with a bit of medical science.

""People were saying, \'I had absolutely zero symptoms. And my disease went into remission!\'"" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nSo he started to wonder: Could these worms cure his alopecia? Maybe his hay fever, too?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Moises Velasquez-Manoff Courtesy of Moises Velasquez-Manoff\n\nHe went down to Mexico, bought 30 hookworms and let the larvae infect him.\n\nHookworm larvae are microscopic. But they have little spikes that puncture the skin and allow the larvae to burrow inside you. Then the critters head straight for a capillary.\n\n""They basically ride your bloodstream back through your heart, into your lungs,"" where they hang out for a while, Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nThen the larvae crawl out of the lung through your stomach and into the small intestine — where they bite onto the intestinal wall and start sucking blood — a few drops a day.\n\nAt that point, the worms do something amazing: They suppress the immune system, says P\'ng Loke, an immunologist at the New York University School of Medicine.\n\n""That\'s the really fascinating thing,"" he says. You see, the worms don\'t shut down the immune system completely — just enough so that the immune cells won\'t attack the worm.\n\nBut this can help with something else. It can keep the immune system from getting out of control and attacking the body.\n\n""If you think about it, the worst thing that you want is an immune system that\'s out of control,"" Loke says.\n\nWhy? Because that\'s when you get autoimmune problems. So the hypothesis is that intestinal worms could possibly reverse these problems, by damping down the immune system.\n\nThe idea was so promising, that back in 2011 a pharmaceutical company decided to test it in clinical trials. Coronado Biosciences put together about six large studies.\n\nThe first study to finish was a big one in Europe that looked to see if pig whipworms helped with Crohn\'s disease.\n\nThe bottom line: ""The proportion of patients who improved with the worms was no different than the proportion of patients who were improved with placebo,"" says Dr. Stephen Hanauer at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who was involved with one trial.\n\nThe whipworms were so ineffective at stopping Crohn\'s disease that Coronado canceled its other trials. The company\'s stock plummeted. And eventually the company changed its name and focus.\n\nOther trials with worms haven\'t gone so well either, says Hanauer. ""The controlled trials, thus far, in a variety of different diseases including childhood allergies and asthma have not been positive.""\n\nIt\'s unclear why the worms haven\'t worked in these trials, Loke says. It could be that the whipworm larvae weren\'t prepared correctly. Or that the worms work for some people but not others. It may depend on a person\'s genes.\n\nBack in Berkeley, Velasquez-Manoff thought he might one of the lucky ones.\n\nA little while after he took the hookworms, his hay fever disappeared.\n\n""Like just gone, gone, gone,"" he says.\n\nAnd his hair?\n\n""Then I had like, little bit of peach fuzzy hair growing here and there on my body,"" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nBut then the tide turned. ""Suddenly it\'s like one day, the whole thing reversed.""\n\nHis hay fever came back. The hair didn\'t grow anymore.\n\nAnd having worms in his body wasn\'t pleasant. At first, he had diarrhea and cramps. That got better. But even months later, he still felt kind of bad.\n\n""I never got back to feeling completely normal for that year [that the worms were inside],"" Velasquez-Manoff says.\n\nHe says the benefits of the worms definitely didn\'t outweigh the bad side effects. And he would never try treating his alopecia or hay fever with them again.\n\n""The way I thought of it was, would I give this to my kids? And the answer is pretty easily and obviously: Hell no,"" Velasquez-Manoff says. ""I wouldn\'t want them to feel this way.""']",We wondered: What was the point of the story?,"Hookworms on intestines.

This story ran as part of a series entitled “Worm Week.” The headline poses the question: “Could Worms in Your Gut Cure Your Allergies?” Or for that matter, could they cure other autoimmune diseases such as asthma, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease?
We have problems with headlines like this one and offer tips on how they can be improved.
The story states that “the worms do something amazing: They suppress the immune system.” And it explains that based on this, there’s a hypothesis that the worms also might work for specific autoimmune diseases.
But then we learn, actually no, they don’t seem to work based on disappointing clinical evidence. So, what about that hypothesis, then? The story doesn’t return to that, instead it just implies that there was something wrong with the research, not the hypothesis. And it never tells us some important facts about using worms in this way, such as that they’re illegal to use therapeutically in the U.S., and that if they are used, they carry very serious risks.
This left us wondering: What was the point of the story? As it’s written, the confusing hypothesis vs evidence set-up is more bewildering than informative, and readers are left in the dark on some important realities of using a risky, unproven treatment.

Among other things, breast milk contains natural sources of prebiotics: small, indigestible fiber molecules that promote the growth of good bacteria in the baby\'s gut. Yet for many families, breastfeeding is difficult or impossible. Fortunately, modern infant formulas are getting closer to the real thing with the help of University of Illinois researchers.\n\nIn a recent study from the Piglet Nutrition and Cognition Lab at U of I, scientists worked with piglets to show prebiotics included in infant formula can enhance memory and exploratory behavior.\n\n""When we provide prebiotics in formula, our results confirm that we can not only benefit gut health, which is known, but we can also influence brain development,"" says Ryan Dilger, associate professor in the Department of Animal Sciences, Division of Nutritional Sciences, and Neuroscience Program at U of I. ""We can actually change the way piglets learn and remember by influencing bacteria in the colon.""\n\nPiglets are widely considered a more informative model for human infants than mice and rats; their digestive systems, behavioral responses, and brain development are remarkably similar to human infants. Therefore, researchers are increasingly turning to piglets to test hypotheses in pre-clinical trials related to human health, especially in the context of gut microbes and brain development.\n\n""There hasn\'t been a lot of work looking at the gut-brain axis in humans, but a lot of rodent work is showing those connections. This is taking it to an animal model that is a lot closer to human infants and asking if that connection still exists and if we can tease out possible mechanisms,"" says Stephen Fleming, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the Neuroscience Program at U of I.\n\nIn early 2016, Dilger and his colleagues worked with piglets to show that a combination of innovative formula components, including prebiotics, may play a role in brain development and behavior. In their new study, the team concentrated solely on the effects of prebiotics.\n\nStarting on the second day of life, piglets were given a cow\'s milk-based infant formula supplemented with polydextrose (PDX), a synthetic carbohydrate with prebiotic activity, and galactooligosaccharide (GOS), a naturally occurring prebiotic. When the piglets were 25 days old, Fleming took them through several learning, memory, and stress tests. After 33 days, blood, brain, and intestinal tissues were collected for analysis.\n\nThe test for learning and memory gave piglets a chance to play with dog toys: one they\'d seen before and one brand-new toy. If they spent more time with the new toy, that was an indication that the piglet recognized it as new and preferred it. This ""novel object recognition"" test improves on classic maze tests commonly used in rodent studies.\n\n""If you\'re trying to test for memory, this test is closer to what we\'d do with an infant. After all, we don\'t generally train infants on mazes,"" Fleming says. ""We know from previous research this test works for pigs, but this is the first published example of using it in a nutrition context.""\n\nPigs fed PDX and GOS spent more time playing with new objects than pigs who didn\'t receive the prebiotic supplements. The preference for novel objects, an indication of natural curiosity, is a sign of healthy brain development and points towards positive development of learning and memory.\n\nWhen prebiotics are working the way they should, good bacteria increase in abundance. One way to tell is by looking at metabolic end-products - volatile fatty acids (VFAs) - excreted by bacteria during digestion of prebiotic fibers.\n\n""Volatile fatty acids are a global indicator for whether prebiotics had an effect on the overall population of bacteria. For example, we might want to see an increase in Lactobacillus and other beneficial bacteria that produce butyrate,"" Dilger explains. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations in the colon, blood, and brain were changed in pigs receiving PDX and GOS compared with control pigs.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that bacterial VFAs could be getting into the blood and traveling to the brain, where they could potentially affect mood and behavior.\n\n""We found that, yes, VFAs are absorbed in the blood of pigs that were fed PDX/GOS. And, yes, they do get into the brain,"" Fleming explains. ""But when we looked at the relationship between these VFAs and the results of our behavior tests, there did not appear to be a clear connection.""\n\nAnother surprise was a decrease in serotonin in brains of pigs fed the prebiotic. ""When you hear less serotonin, there\'s an immediate reaction to say, \'Well, that\'s bad,\'"" Fleming says. Not necessarily; those pigs didn\'t show greater anxiety than control pigs during a stress test or poorer performance when given a learning and memory test. The researchers hypothesize that the prebiotics may alter levels of tryptophan, serotonin\'s amino acid precursor, but it\'s too early to say.\n\nAlthough more work is needed to tackle remaining questions, the study adds to the growing body of research suggesting a strong and potentially modifiable link between the gut and the brain: a link that makers of infant formula should strongly consider.\n\n""There are so many ways we can alter the composition of the microbiota and they can have very strong benefits. Promoting good \'gut health\' remains a strong focus in the field of nutrition,"" Dilger says.\n\n###\n\nThe article, ""Dietary polydextrose and galactooligosaccharide increase exploratory behavior, improve recognition memory, and alter neurochemistry in the young pig,"" is published in Nutritional Neuroscience. Fleming and Dilger\'s co-authors include Supida Monaikul, Alexander Patsavas, Rosaline Waworuntu, and Brian Berg. The work was supported by Mead Johnson Nutrition.']",The headline of this release needs two additional words: “in pigs.”,"Using piglets to test hypotheses related to infant brain development and the consumption of prebiotics seems to be important research, but at this point, it is hard to tell how relevant this research is to humans. A better discussion of the benefits and harms found in the study, as well as the human relevance of the overall research would have greatly improved this release. Nothing in the release relates to breast milk — it only compared formulas. Any discussion of formula versus breast milk in infant development needs to refer to the overall context of what we know about the topic already and this release skipped those details.

The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology\'s annual meeting, in Los Angeles.\n\n""Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla.\n\nBagla is director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study.\n\nMuch of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. In fact, small blood vessels created by degenerative arthritis feed this inflammation by increasing blood flow to the lining.\n\nTo treat this, Bagla and his colleagues decided to try blocking those tiny blood vessels using microparticles -- spheres about a tenth of a millimeter in size made from a synthetic gel-like material.\n\nThe microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said.\n\n""It\'s an outpatient procedure, and no physical therapy is required before or after this procedure,"" he said.\n\nThe small pilot study -- the first U.S. clinical trial of this procedure -- involved 20 patients with moderate to severe arthritis pain. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday\'s annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said.\n\nThose eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said. They started with an average baseline of 72, which means their pain was brought down to manageable levels, he said.\n\nPhysical function of their knee also improved, based on an index used to judge the effects of osteoarthritis, Bagla added.\n\nOverall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded.\n\nBagla said no side effects are expected because the procedure only blocks additional blood flow to the knee, rather than cutting it off altogether.\n\n""You don\'t normally have this degree of increased blood supply to this lining. We\'re not blocking normal blood vessels to the knee or leg or bone or cartilage,"" he said.\n\nFinal results from this clinical trial are expected to be released this summer. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said.\n\nThey think it will be most appropriate for people between ages 40 and 70 who aren\'t ready to go through knee replacement, or people who are on chronic pain medication for their knee arthritis, Bagla said.\n\n""Perhaps we can demonstrate and prove patients do not need to be on these medications and can alternatively go through a minimally invasive procedure like this to reduce their knee pain,"" Bagla said.\n\nDr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure ""very promising,"" given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.\n\n""This therapy is very well-targeted to that particular mechanism, and certainly it should be investigated further,"" said Vedantham, who wasn\'t involved with the study. He\'s a professor of radiology and surgery at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nResearch presented at medical meetings is typically considered preliminary until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Arthritis Foundation has more about knee pain.']","It isn’t really clear yet how the treatment works, how long it works for, how often it may need to be done, nor what its side effects are in the short-term and long-term.","This story reports on incomplete results from an ongoing trial of a procedure to treat arthritis pain by injecting microparticles into blood vessels around the knee.
The data — from just eight patients — were presented at the Society of Interventional Radiology’s annual meeting.  While story does some things well, overall this was a tiny, short-term, unfinished study that doesn’t seem ready for a wide consumer audience.

Four years after the procedure, patients over 65 who had coronary artery bypass surgeries (called CABG or ""cabbages"") were almost 20 percent less likely to die.\n\nPut another way, 21 percent of stented patients had died after four years compared with 16 percent of surgery patients.\n\nIs that a big difference? Well, the study\'s lead author tells Shots that it might be enough to ""tip the balance a little bit, but not overwhelmingly so.""\n\nThe National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which funded the study with new ""stimulus"" money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is more bullish on the implications.\n\n""We would hope a study as powerful as this one will inform decision-makers to rethink the direction they\'re going in,"" the NHLBI\'s Dr. Michael Lauer told Shots. He says it\'s been worrying that so many doctors have been opting for stenting over surgery.\n\nStudy author Dr. William Weintraub, chief of cardiology at Christiana Care Health System in Newark, Del., is presenting the data at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. The study also appears online in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIt draws on data from more than 86,000 patients across the nation who underwent CABG operations and nearly 104,000 patients who had coronary stenting. They had blockages in either two or three coronary arteries but did not require emergency procedures.\n\nAlthough the pro-surgery outcome is not a game-changer, Weintraub says it might cause some doctors and patients to consider surgery. And he says it supports those who now opt for CABGs.\n\n""It\'s a very big deal to recommend coronary surgery to patients,"" Weintraub says. ""I think doctors work very hard to weigh what\'s best for their patients. When doctors recommend surgery, these data suggest that that decision is a good one.""\n\nBut Dr. Laura Mauri says in an accompanying editorial that the new study can\'t settle any debates. Only studies that randomly assign comparable patients to surgery or stenting can do that. Mauri is an interventional cardiologist – i.e., a specialist who does coronary stenting – at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital inBoston.\n\nWeintraub notes it\'s ""very difficult and expensive"" to do randomized studies on this question – and to make the comparison groups truly comparable. And while such a study is being done, the technology (especially stenting technology) changes. That can call into question the ultimate relevance of the findings.\n\nSo the new data may be the best that doctors and patients in this situation can expect for the foreseeable future.']",The story provides some solid information about pros and cons but could have provided more on costs and harms.,"This clear and concise piece touches on many of our criteria, but only lightly.

The findings will appear in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease.\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is the most common type of dementia. Symptoms include serious memory loss, confusion, and mood changes that develop gradually and worsen with time.\n\nThe new study included 124 people aged 65 to 88 who had mild cognitive impairment, which is the medical term for mild memory loss.

Patients were tracked from four to 12 years, with a median of 9.2 years. The research builds on a 2006 Lancet Neurology study that followed patients for a median of 5.2 years, beginning with a group of 137 volunteers with mild cognitive impairment.The new study is important because of the long follow-up period, according to Adam Brickman, assistant professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.\n\nKnowing which patient with mild cognitive impairment patients may go on to develop Alzheimer\'s is vital information for researchers, who are looking for treatments for the fatal brain disease. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. Clinical trials can better focus their efforts if patients are known to be in the early stages of Alzheimer\'s. Generally, about 30% to 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment show evidence of underlying symptoms of Alzheimer\'s, so not everyone with this condition is a good candidate for an Alzheimer\'s trial.\n\nResearchers focused on two biomarkers previously thought to be involved in Alzheimer\'s disease: a kind of protein called beta-amyloid, and another protein type called tau. Experts believe a decrease in beta-amyloid in the fluid of the spinal cord is associated with a toxic buildup of that protein in the brain, which causes the formation of plaques linked to Alzheimer\'s disease. Tau has been tied to neurofibrillary tangles in the brain; researchers find that an increase in tau in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with Alzheimer\'s also.\n\nThe results from the study suggest that beta-amyloid is a much earlier predictor of Alzheimer\'s disease than tau, which supports the hypothesis that beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain occurs first in the course of the disease.\n\nSome of the participants, who were originally found to be stable with mild cognitive impairment after about five years, went on to develop Alzheimer\'s disease during the longer follow-up. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer\'s disease, researchers say.\n\nThe association between biomarkers in the fluid and Alzheimer\'s was also described in studies in December 2009 and August 2010, building on the idea that a spinal tap could be useful in predicting Alzheimer\'s.\n\nWhen these sorts of studies get published, Brickman and other doctors get phone calls from aging adults wondering whether they should be getting spinal taps to assess their risk. But it\'s too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman. Down the road, the ""fantasy"" is that asymptomatic people will be able to get a biomarker test to determine whether they\'ll one day get Alzheimer\'s, but that\'s not possible right now, he adds.\n\n""What I tell people is: If they’re worried about their thinking abilities, that they should make an appointment with a neuropsychology or a neurologist to get an evaluation,"" Brinkman says. ""The way we diagnose Alzheimer’s disease is by evaluating the behavior and the risk factor medical profile, not by looking at biological markers at this point.""\n\nAs scientists gain more insight into predicting Alzheimer\'s, aging adults may struggle with the question of whether they want to know their risk, especially since there\'s still no cure. Some people want to enroll in clinical trials as soon as they start showing symptoms; others would rather be ignorant of their status since there is no cure. In looking for treatments, however, researchers depend on people\'s willingness to contribute to science.\n\nThe Alzheimer\'s Association runs a system called TrialMatch. Check it out if you\'re interested in finding a trial for yourself or someone you care about.']","Thorough job, addressing all of our criteria except for the potential cost implications of such a test.","This story is a good example of what an independent expert’s perspective can bring to a piece.

We\'ve found a way to block CatK only in bone tissue that we think will prevent these other negative effects.""\n\nThe researchers tested a compound derived from red sage in human and mouse bone cells and a mouse model.

This version has been corrected.\n\nA small company started by a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester has moved closer to providing doctors with what he says is a simple, computer-based tool to help detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems has received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Cognivue, a cognitive-assessment tool that functions somewhat like a video game. A patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a time-strapped primary-care physician tends to other patients. The 10-minute, non\xadinvasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain’s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia.\n\nThe federal government’s approval to market the device comes as Alzheimer’s researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages.\n\n[Scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for Alzheimer’s disease]\n\n“Look, there is a late-life tsunami of late-life cognitive decline coming at us, and health-care providers are standing on the beach,” said Charles J. Duffy, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who founded the company. “What we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care.”\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of dementia. That number is expected to reach 13.5 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. In addition to Alzheimer’s, a person’s mental competency can be hindered by other conditions, such as untreated diabetes, thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications.\n\nDuffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test people’s memory and ability to think.\n\nWith Cognivue, patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images, such as a group of dots, that move around and fluctuate in clarity. Using a rotary-shaped mouse called a manipulandum, the patients try to follow the dots with a wedge-shaped cursor. The task becomes more difficult, especially for people with early stages of dementia, as the dots move around, changing their direction, speed and intensity.\n\n“All perception is interpretive, and so what we’re doing is measuring that process,” Duffy said. Other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems’ device received de novo approval from the FDA, a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk.\n\nThe Pittsford, N.Y.-based company’s FDA application included data from a comparative study involving 401 people recruited from 13 communities for older adults. The subjects, ranging in age from 55 to 95, were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities: normal, mild cognitive impairment and impaired. Their performance on the Cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS).\n\nThe device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven.\n\nLinda M. Rice, a primary-care internist with about 1,200 patients in her Rochester practice, said that after a year of using the device in her clinic, she is convinced of its worth. About half of her patients are older than 65, and they often have questions about memory loss and their cognitive abilities.\n\nBut her options for rating their performance involve administering the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) , also known as the Folstein test, that uses a 30-point questionnaire. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.\n\n“You have to be pretty bad to do poorly on this exam,” she said.\n\nBut the alternative involves referring patients for a battery of neuropsychiatric tests that can take hours to complete and cost $1,000 or more. The computer-based tool created by Duffy has helped Rice to convince some patients that it’s time to stop driving and to start them on medications sooner to slow the progress of Alzheimer’s.\n\n“I think it’s a really potentially valuable tool,” said Leslie Algase, an internist who tends about 2,000 patients in Rochester, at least 30 percent of whom are older than 65. Algase, who said she has no financial ties to the company, agreed to use the Cognivue in her practice about three years ago after meeting Duffy at a conference.\n\nAlgase rates the device as about as accurate as the MMSE. But she said it’s more convenient and less time-consuming to administer.']",The 2-star score doesn’t reflect the significant legwork that went into this piece. But that effort could have been applied to better effect in several areas that are highlighted in this review.,"There was more to like about this story than its 2-star score might suggest. There is substantial and thorough reporting about the problems with current approaches to diagnosing dementia, and the story demonstrates great legwork in seeking out the opinions of experts who have used the device that’s profiled in the piece. A lot of 2-star stories seem to be thrown together without much original reporting, and that’s certainly not the case here.
With that being said, the story does lack some key information regarding the benefits, costs, and harms of the device. There were also a few borderline calls where we felt that a Satisfactory score couldn’t be given for specific reasons, even though the story came close to meeting our standard. In short, a few small changes would have altered our ratings substantially and resulted in a higher score. But the story is still well worth a read, and delivers plenty of valuable information.

""This well-designed study reinforces the idea that there is value in vaccinating young men against a virus that is nearly ubiquitous among sexually active individuals.""\n\nGardasil protects against several strains of HPV, which is the leading cause of cervical cancer in women. It has also been linked to vulvar, anal and throat cancers. Studies have shown it to be about 100 percent effective in preventing precancerous cervical lesions in females.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for girls in 2008 and for boys aged 9 through 26 in 2009. Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that 11- and 12-year-old girls begin receiving the vaccine as part of school vaccination efforts, an advisory panel voted against routine use of the vaccine in boys and men.\n\nUptake of the vaccine, which costs about $390 for the 3-shot regimen, has been far from universal among girls. According to a study presented last year by researchers at the University of Maryland, just one-third of teen girls and young women who start the three-dose series actually finish, and almost three-quarters don\'t start it at all.\n\nBut study author Anna Giuliano believes that, ""vaccinating males would have a direct benefit that men would receive, as well as a community benefit. If you reduce infections in men, you\'re going to reduce transmission to their partners so you have the herd immunity effect.""\n\nHPV is almost ubiquitous in males and females, but experts note that most people will clear the virus naturally so that it does not result in any harm.\n\nThis study involved more than 4,000 boys and men aged 16-to-26 from 18 different countries who were randomly assigned to get the vaccine or not. All were HPV-free at the beginning of the trial, and were followed for about three years.\n\nAmong participants who completed the three-vaccine series, Gardasil afforded 90 percent protection against HPV.\n\n""It\'s a similar efficacy to what we\'ve seen in females,"" said Giuliano, who is chair of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa.\n\nThe researchers also saw some reduction in the number of precancerous penile lesions, although at this point they said it\'s impossible to know whether this will result in a lower rate of penile cancers.\n\n""We\'re going to finally be able to see men benefit from vaccine, as women have, in coming years,"" said Giuliano.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on HPV.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story got the same 3-star score as a </span>","The story is amazingly silent on the message that there is controversy about vaccinating young men.

Decipher is a Medicare-covered genomic test capable of predicting tumor aggressiveness in men following prostate surgery. The study, titled ""Impact of a Genomic Classifier of Metastatic Risk on Postprostatectomy Treatment Recommendations by Radiation Oncologists and Urologists,"" was published in this month\'s issue of Urology.\n\n""Conflicting treatment recommendations by different specialists looking at the same disease can be highly confusing for patients and is a problem for the health care system in general,"" said Paul Nguyen, M.D., of Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women\'s Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School. ""The Decipher test\'s tendency to make the two specialties more concordant in their treatment recommendations provides significant value toward standardizing care for patients.""\n\nThe study was designed to evaluate how the Decipher Prostate Cancer Classifier, which predicts the risk of metastasis after prostatectomy, would impact adjuvant treatment recommendations made by urologists and radiation oncologists. These two specialties often disagree on which patients should receive radiation therapy following surgery and when.\n\nUsing clinical information alone, observation rather than adjuvant radiation therapy was recommended in 42% of decisions made by urologists and 23% of decisions by radiation oncologists (P < .0001). The Decipher test results altered 45% and 35% of treatment recommendations made by urologists and radiation oncologists, respectively. Decipher results indicating genomic high risk resulted in intensification of treatment, whereas genomic low risk resulted in less aggressive recommendations. The Decipher results increased agreement in treatment recommendations between urologists and radiation oncologists, as the odds of a recommendation for adjuvant treatment by urologists vs radiation oncologists increased from 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.44) to 0.46 (95% CI, 0.29-0.75) after results of the Decipher test were made available.\n\n""It is notable that while the Decipher test significantly influenced treatment decisions, it did not increase the total number of people receiving adjuvant therapy, suggesting that it helped ensure that the ones selected for adjuvant therapy are the ones most likely to benefit from it,"" said Doug Dolginow, M.D., chief executive officer of GenomeDx. ""As genomic tests like Decipher become used more routinely in urologic cancer patient care, they will have a greater impact on treatment recommendations in clinical practice and allow for better personalization of therapy.""\n\nThe Decipher test used in this study has been previously described in multiple blinded independent validation studies in men at high risk of recurrence at the time of prostatectomy. Researchers found that 60% of the clinically high-risk men would be reclassified as low risk based on the Decipher test and have only a 2.4% risk of metastasis at 5 years after surgery. In addition, the 19% of the patients with the highest risk based on Decipher had a nearly 10-fold higher risk of distant metastases by 5 years. The test provided a more accurate and precise estimate of a patient\'s risk of recurrence. Use of this test therefore has the potential to assist clinicians to better direct utilization of secondary therapy after surgery.\n\nAbout Decipher®\n\nThe Decipher® Prostate Cancer Classifier is a highly validated and commercially available genomic test for men with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer. Decipher predicts cancer aggressiveness by looking for a unique genomic signature comprised of a validated series of biomarkers associated with metastatic disease. Adding truly unique information to the treatment decision-making process, Decipher generates a risk result that is completely independent and distinct from PSA, Gleason score and other clinical risk factors. Clinical studies from leading cancer centers published in over a dozen medical journals demonstrate that Decipher can accurately predict metastatic disease, which men may benefit from radiation therapy following prostate surgery, and can lead to significant cost-savings for healthcare systems. Decipher was developed in partnership with the Mayo Clinic.\n\nDecipher is covered by Medicare and multiple private insurance plans in the US.\n\nLearn more at: www.DecipherTest.com and follow Decipher on Twitter @DecipherTest and on Facebook.\n\nAbout GenomeDx Biosciences\n\nGenomeDx Biosciences is focused on transforming cancer patient care by putting usable genomic information in the hands of patients and their physicians. GenomeDx is developing and commercializing Decipher®, a highly validated genomic test for predicting metastatic disease in men with prostate cancer. In partnership with leading medical centers, the company has assembled the largest genomic catalogue of prostate cancer tumors in the world, representing billions of data points and more than 20 years of prostate cancer research expertise.

But it lacks the context that would truly inform readers about the test’s potential to improve their care.,"In this news release, we’re introduced to a world of confusion among doctors about what to do with a man after they remove his cancerous, walnut-sized prostate gland. And the release offers something that can allegedly reduce that confusion: GenomeDx Biosciences’ Decipher, a test that sniffs out 22 different genetic signals of how a cancer case might play out.
Next we’re told about the struggle between urologists and radiation oncologists. The former group is less likely than the latter to prescribe “adjuvant therapy,” typically radiation, after removing a prostate gland. Missing high-risk cancer cases and not treating them is a problem, of course, but so is treating men who probably don’t need it. (Although we’re never really told why that’s an issue.)
According to the release, Decipher has the ability to change the minds of both urologists (45%) and radiation oncologists (35%), and get more of them to agree what or what not to do with a patient after removal of his cancerous prostate gland. That’s potentially an important advance, but we aren’t provided with crucial context — notably that it’s unclear if the decisions made because of Decipher were actually better decisions that would lead to a reduction in prostate cancer deaths. We’re also never cautioned about the small size of the study, given cost information about the test, or told about potential harms.

Robot surgery may not be the answer,"['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Robots may not help doctors do a better job on some surgeries, according to a new study.\n\nSurgeons treating women with endometriosis - a chronic condition that affects more than 5 million women and adolescent girls in the U.S. - didn’t get better or faster results when they used a robotic system.\n\nWith the surgeon alone, “the incision is smaller (and) the manipulations are more controlled,” Dr. Ceana Nezhat, an author on the study and the chair of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Northside Hospital in Atlanta, told Reuters Health.\n\nBecause the robot lets the surgeon get a better picture of the inside of the body, the authors had expected that surgeries using the robot would go more smoothly than those without it.\n\nTo test this idea, they looked back at 78 minor surgeries that were done on women with endometriosis - half using the assistance of a robot, half without it.\n\nThere was no difference in how much blood patients lost, and there were no complications in either group. But robotic surgeries took longer than non-robotic surgeries by about 40 minutes - 3 hours and 11 minutes compared to 2 hours and 29 minutes, on average. Longer surgeries often mean a more tired surgeon and more chances for things to go wrong.\n\nThe robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one.\n\nSurgical robots do not operate on their own. Rather, surgeons move electronic instruments that are linked to the movement of other instruments inside the body, while they watch a three-dimensional image of what’s going on inside. One robot can cost around $1.5 million.\n\n“We were surprised that (surgery with the robot) did not have better outcomes than (the surgeon alone), as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better,” the authors write.\n\nHowever, they suggest that more complicated procedures for severe endometriosis, which might require open surgery, would benefit from the help of a robot.\n\nInexperienced doctors might also take advantage of the robot for surgery if they don’t think they have the skills to do the surgery with only a small cut, Dr. Nezhat said. In this case, the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one.\n\nDr. Tommaso Falcone, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Cleveland Clinic, said this study shows that more technology is not always better. Using a robot for basic surgery, like the kind studied here, would be like using a computer to do addition, he told Reuters Health.\n\n“I just need a calculator to add a few things,” said Falcone, who was not involved in the study. “Yes it’s true that if I’ve got that supercomputer maybe it looks better. But all I need to do is add 5 and 5.”\n\nEspecially in a time of concern over rising medical costs, “we should not simply use the highly sophisticated technology just because it’s there,” Falcone said.\n\nSOURCE: here\n\nFertility and Sterility, online May 26, 2010.']","This story is important because it highlights an example where robots may not improve outcomes and in fact may add to cost.  The story does not explore this fully, however.","What could have been a John Henry style man-triumphs-over-technology story with outsized language and overheated quotes turns out to be a fairly straightforward, clear-eyed piece of reporting – but with some missing elements.

Then she developed knee pain so severe that she could not climb stairs.\n\nSo Pierce, a doctoral student in food science, went to see physical therapist Matt Briggs at The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. He performed deep massages, suggested changes in her running form and taught her how to exercise her thigh and gluteal muscles to better protect her knees. She believes all of that helped.\n\nBut Pierce, like a growing number of patients, had another treatment she is convinced helped even more. It’s called ""dry needling,"" and it involves the insertion of thin, non-medicated solid needles into muscles or connective tissues. Proponents say it can reduce pain and improve movement. Pierce has had the procedure more than half a dozen times and believes it is one reason she will be able to run her fourth marathon in November.\n\n“This has kind of changed my life,” she says.\n\nTestimonials like that are a big reason dry needling has caught on with some physical therapists, athletes and other patients, Briggs says. But testimonials are not scientific proof.\n\nAnd there, Briggs says, is where dry needling is lacking. While some studies have shown promise, he says, “the quality of the evidence is not strong.” That’s why Briggs and his colleagues are starting a study looking at dry needling in “runner’s knee,” the condition that has plagued Pierce. Their goal, and the goal of other researchers now looking at dry needling, is to produce results rigorous enough to show whether it really works.\n\nFor now, here’s what consumers should know:\n\nIs this acupuncture?\n\nPhysical therapists say it is not, “though superficially, it may look the same,” says Justin Elliott, vice president of government affairs for the American Physical Therapy Association. For one thing, he says, dry needling as performed by a physical therapist is not rooted in ancient Chinese medicine — there’s no talk about redirecting the body’s energy flow by placing needles at certain points in the body. Instead, needles are placed directly in problem areas.\n\nElliott says dry needling also is practiced by some chiropractors, naturopathic physicians and nurses, which puts it outside the realm of any one specialty.\n\nAcupuncturists beg to differ. “What is being called dry needling is clearly a form of acupuncture” and should be done only by professionals extensively trained in that discipline, says Thomas Burgoon, a West Chester, Pa., physician who is president of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. He says many acupuncturists do exactly what the physical therapists describe, with the same kind of needles.\n\nBurgoon’s group has persuaded some states to bar physical therapists from the practice.\n\n\n\nHow might it work?\n\nOne theory is that the needles cause tight muscles to twitch, then relax. The needles may also increase blood flow or set off nerve responses that alter pain perception, Briggs says.\n\nAnother possibility: It’s a placebo effect, an improvement triggered by the expectation that a treatment will work rather than by the treatment itself. To look for that possibility, the Ohio State study will compare patients who get the real needle treatment to those poked with sham needles that don’t pierce the skin.\n\nMark Crislip, an infectious-disease doctor in Portland, Ore., who recently wrote about dry needling for Science-Based Medicine — a website critical of alternative medicine — says the version practiced by physical therapists doesn’t “come with the mystical baggage that accompanies acupuncture.” But he says it may well be a “theatrical placebo.”\n\nWhat do published studies say?\n\n“It’s a mixed bag,” Elliott says. In a 2011 review, the physical therapy association rated the evidence for dry needling a 3 out of 5, based on the best studies. A formal analysis of 35 trails on acupuncture and dry needling for chronic lower back pain was published by the Cochrane research group in 2005. It found they “may be useful” additions to standard treatment. But it said higher quality studies were needed.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nNeedling can produce minor bleeding and some soreness, but in trained hands, and with the use of sterile needles and gloves, “it’s a very safe procedure,” Briggs says.\n\nIn rare cases, deep needling can lead to a punctured lung or injuries to nerves and blood vessels, and acupuncturists fear non-specialists will be more likely to make such mistakes, Burgoon says.\n\nWill insurers pay for this?\n\nMany will not. Charges for patients can range from $10 to $75 per session, says Edo Zylstra, CEO of KinetaCore, a company that offers intensive three-day weekend courses in dry needling to physical therapists.\n\nDo all physical therapists offer this?\n\nNo. The physical therapy association tells members in seven states to steer clear because of recent court or regulatory decisions or language in existing licensing laws. They are: California, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, New York, South Dakota and Washington.\n\nAnd most of the nation’s 200,000 licensed physical therapists are not trained in the technique. About 6,000 have taken courses in dry needling in the past few years, Zylstra says.']",The story is a tidy overview of the evidence — and lack of evidence — around an alternative technique for treating pain known as “dry needling.”,"This is a story about an alternative therapy known as “dry needling.” It involves inserting needles into the skin, similarly to acupuncture.
The story leads with an anecdote that comes dangerously close to being a promotional advertisement for an unproven alternative therapy for pain, but that’s just the hook. The story (and the headline) is more measured, sifting through what we know and what we don’t know yet about dry needling, largely through interviews with competing trade associations.
We would have liked if the story had gone a step further and delved into the actual science behind dry needling and acupuncture more deeply, and if some of the interviews with people with vested interests had been exchanged for interviews with pain management experts who don’t have a predisposition for or against the procedure. There is enough evidence on acupuncture as a therapy to have persuaded at least some states to create medical licensure programs for its practice, and the story touches at the very end on the idea that there is a training component here that needs further exploration.
[Editor’s note: The notion that the evidence on acupuncture has persuaded states to create medical licensure programs has been contested by the Society for Science-Based Medicine in this post. They argue that evidence is not a factor in state licensing of such practitioners. We have also amended our comments under the “Independent Sources” criterion below in response to their feedback.] 
For this type of story, which is trying to truth-test some of the claims being made about a buzzed about alternative therapy, we really appreciate the question and answer format. The story calls out some of the key elements, including risks and costs, that are necessary for patients to make informed decisions.

Under previous therapies, none had shown progress.\n\nThis success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nAnorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between 15 and 19 years. Symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient, and a need to control calorie intake and output.\n\nTreatment usually focuses on changing behaviour, but experts say up to 20 percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely.\n\nCommenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia.\n\n“The fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,” they said.\n\n“(This) will go some way towards reassuring patients that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better.”\n\nDBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia.\n\nImplanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said.\n\nFor their study, a team at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada identified an area of the brain known to be important when using DBS in depression.\n\nThey implanted electrodes into the area and connected them to a pulse generator under the skin. The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients’ mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.\n\nThe patients, all women, were aged between 24 and 57 and had had anorexia for between four and 37 years.\n\nInitially all six lost weight, but researchers said this was expected since studies of DBS in patients with depression also found a delay of a few months before treatment starts to work.\n\nThree months after treatment, the weight loss began to reverse in some patients, and after nine months, three patients weighed more than before treatment - the longest period of sustained weight increase since they had become ill. Around half also had better moods and less obsessive-compulsive behaviour.\n\nAndres Lozano, who led the study, said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect, rather than a placebo or hunger-increasing effect.\n\nHe also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were “especially striking” given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies. (Editing by Andrew Roche)']",Unwarranted leaps of faith were taken from a preliminary safety trial in just 6 people.,"Stating that “success” in a study of 6 people “suggests larger trials will confirm effectiveness” is not good journalism.
The harms of the intervention were also largely ignored.
So were the costs.
These are big issues.
Although this piece mentions the pilot nature of the study, the hopeful language and parallels to other therapeutic uses of DBS lead the reader to assume it is likely to work. We don’t know that and won’t for some time.

Cher of SI-BONE, Inc., in San Jose, Calif. (The study was sponsored by SI-BONE, manufacturer of the SIJ implants.)\n\nGood Pain Relief and Other Outcomes with Implant Treatment for SIJ Dysfunction\n\nThe study included 148 patients with low back pain caused by confirmed SIJ dysfunction, treated at 19 US spine surgery clinics. The SIJ connects the central (sacrum) and lateral (ilium) bones of the pelvis. SIJ disruption or osteoarthritis is a common pain condition, estimated to cause 15 to 23 percent of cases of chronic low back pain.\n\nTrial subjects had severe SIJ pain, with an average pain score of 82 on a 0-to-100-point scale. Average pain duration was longer than six years, and about two-thirds of subjects were taking opioid (narcotic) medications. Many had previously received many non-surgical SIJ treatments, and many had a history of prior spinal surgery.\n\nTwo-thirds of subjects were randomly assigned to undergo minimally invasive SIJ fusion. In this procedure, triangular titanium implants were placed through a small incision to stabilize and fuse the SIJ. Procedures were unilateral in most cases, but some subjects underwent bilateral treatment. The remaining subjects received nonsurgical treatments, such as physical therapy, steroid injections and/or radiofrequency ablation of sacral nerve root lateral branches.\n\nPain and other outcomes were compared at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. At 6 months, subjects in the nonsurgical group had the option to ""cross over"" to the implant procedure.\n\nBased on reduction in pain and absence of complications at 6 months, treatment was rated successful in 81 percent of subjects assigned to the SIJ implant procedure, compared to 26 percent with nonsurgical treatment. Average pain score decreased to 30 in the surgical group versus 72 in the nonsurgical group. Seventy-three percent of subjects undergoing the implant procedure had ""clinically significant"" reduction in disability scores, compared to just 14 percent in the nonsurgical group.\n\nAfter one year, subjects assigned to SIJ fusion still had significant reductions in pain and disability, as well as improved quality of life. Thirty-five subjects from the nonsurgical group opted to undergo the implant procedure, with similarly good results. There were only a few complications related to the SIJ implant procedure.\n\nSacroiliac joint dysfunction is a common cause of disabling pain in the lower back, buttocks, or groin. Many different surgical and nonsurgical treatments have been used for this condition, despite a lack of high-quality evidence for their effectiveness.\n\nThe minimally invasive SIJ implant approach evaluated in this trial has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. The study is the first randomized controlled trial to directly compare the results of surgical and nonsurgical treatment for SIJ dysfunction.\n\nThe results show ""clinically and statistically important"" improvements in clinical outcomes for patients undergoing the SIJ implant procedure, according to Dr. Cher and colleagues, with ""profound differences"" between the surgical and nonsurgical groups. The implant procedure is minimally invasive, has few complications, and produces significant and lasting improvements in pain, disability, and quality of life.\n\nThe authors note some important limitations of the trial, including the lack of long-term outcomes in the nonsurgical group due to the high crossover rate. They plan further analyses, including two-year follow-up CT scans and a cost-effectiveness comparison of SIJ fusion versus nonsurgical treatment.\n\n###\n\nClick here to read ""Randomized Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Using Triangular Titanium Implants vs Nonsurgical Management for Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction: 12-Month Outcomes.""\n\nArticle: ""Randomized Controlled Trial of Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Using Triangular Titanium Implants vs Nonsurgical Management for Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction: 12-Month Outcomes"" (doi: 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000988)\n\nAbout Neurosurgery\n\nNeurosurgery, the Official Journal of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, is your most complete window to the contemporary field of neurosurgery.

""We cannot, however, recommend statins for cancer prevention without a positive clinical trial.""\n\nFor the study, Potluri and colleagues collected data on nearly 1 million patients listed in a clinical database from January 2000 to March 2013. The database includes information on cancer and other medical conditions, including high cholesterol. Data on deaths was obtained from the U.K. Office for National Statistics.\n\nAmong the patients in the study, nearly 8,000 had lung cancer, 5,500 had breast cancer, 4,600 had prostate cancer and 4,500 had colon cancer, the researchers found.\n\nAfter adjusting for factors that might play a role in dying, such as age, gender, ethnicity and common causes of death, the researchers found those taking statins lived longer than those who were not taking them.\n\nThe results were to be presented Friday at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Florence, Italy. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nOne expert doesn\'t think sufficient evidence exists yet to take statins to prevent or treat cancer.\n\n""Regardless of whether or not a person has cancer, statin use should be discussed with a health care provider,"" said Eric Jacobs, strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society.\n\n""There is little evidence that statins affect cancer risk or survival, but clear evidence that they can help some people lower risk of heart attacks and strokes,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the American Heart Association for more on statins.']","This story was appropriately cautious in pointing out this was observational data, but it got one important thing wrong, likely stemming from a confusing news release.","This story is about a preliminary report to the European Society of Cardiology. The story asserts that UK scientists analyzed a large health information dataset and found a correlation between taking statin drugs and a reduced likelihood of dying from certain cancers.
However, the story got this correlation wrong. As the news release from the ESC states, the correlation is between “high cholesterol”–not statin use–and a reduced likelihood of dying from certain cancers. This disconnect seems to also stem from the news release, which offers up a misleading headline, and hints later that it’s probably the use of statins in individuals who have high cholesterol that creates this relationship between cholesterol levels and cancer risk. But, crucially, it offers no evidence of that, just conjecture.
Other than this major problem, the story does some things right: It wisely urges caution about the data in its opening sentence, repeats that caution several times, and tried to help readers see the difference between correlation and causation– something we hold dear here. The story used phrases like “the study found an association — but no proof — of prolonged survival” and quoted a scientist saying: “We cannot, however, recommend statins for cancer prevention without a positive clinical trial.”

Many people currently take fish oil supplements to decrease their risk for heart disease.\n\nIn the study, 880 women developed breast cancer during six years of follow-up. The use of fish oil was linked to lower risk of invasive ductal breast cancer. Ductal breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer and forms in the milk ducts. Lobular breast cancer forms in the milk glands. Researchers did not have information on the doses of fish oil that were taken by women in the study.\n\nExactly how fish oil may affect breast cancer risk is not fully understood, but it may be related to its strong anti-inflammatory properties. Some research suggests that inflammation plays a role in the development of breast and other cancers. Other studies have not found a link between eating more fatty fish and breast cancer risk, but it may be that the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil supplements is much higher than what is typically found in the diet.\n\nOther supplements were not linked to breast cancer risk in the new study, including black cohosh, dong quai, soy, and St. John\'s wort, which are often taken to relieve some of the symptoms of menopause.\n\nThe new research is part of the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) study, which included data from women 50 to 76 years old from Washington state.']","Four sources were interviewed – a strength of this story – delivering appropriate caveats.

Dr. Vigneswaran is division director of thoracic surgery and a professor in the department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.\n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma is caused by environmental factors such as exposure to asbestos as well as a genetic predisposition to the cancer. It develops in the pleura, the thin layer of tissue surrounding the lungs. As the tumor grows, it restricts the lungs, typically causing shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss and/or chest discomfort and pain. In PD surgery, the pleura is removed. While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain. Dr. Vigneswaran and colleagues administered a cancer quality-of-life survey known as the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent PD surgery. The median age was 70, with a range of 50 to 88. Prior to surgery, 31 percent of the patients had a performance status score of 0 (fully functional); 65 percent had a performance status score of 1 (able to do light house work or office work); and 4 percent had a performance status of 2 (ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to work). Following surgery, all patients were surveyed at 1 month, 4-5 months, 7-8 months and 10-11 months.\n\nThe quality of life survey measured overall functioning (physical, emotional, cognitive, etc.); general symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain); individual items (shortness of breath, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation and financial difficulties) and overall health.\n\nImproved quality of life was observed in the first month after surgery and was maintained at late follow-up in all patients. Quality of life was not adversely affected by surgery at any time in patients who, prior to surgery, had performance status of 1 or 2; a tumor volume greater than 600 ml. or a type of tumor cell called non-epithelioid.\n\n“The net benefit of pleurectomy and decortication justifies the procedure in the majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma,” Dr. Vigneswaran concluded.\n\nThe study is titled “Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Pleurectomy and Decortication for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.” The surgeries were performed by Dr. Vigneswaran at University of Chicago Medicine, where he practiced before recently joining Loyola.']","<span style=""color: #1a1a1a;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">More information on the possible harms from surgery for mesothelioma would have made this release summarizing a study more complete.<br/>

It may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as 6 months who have older siblings with the disorder, according to a new study by a national network of researchers.\n\nInfants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism, which is typically diagnosed when a child is 2- to 3-years-old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech or nonverbal communication.\n\nResearchers used magnetic resonance imaging — or MRI — to scan the brains of 343 infants when they were 6 months, 12 months and 24 months old. Two-thirds of the infants were high risk, having an older sibling with autism. The scans showed that 70 percent of high-risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age 2 had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at 6 and 12 months, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine.\n\nOn the right, MRI of a baby at 6 months who was diagnosed with autism at 2 years. The dark space between the brain folds and skull indicate increased amounts of cerebrospinal fluid. On the left: MRI of a baby who was not diagnosed with autism at age 2. Note the decreased amount of CSF. UNC Health Care / UNC School of Medicine\n\nThis excess fluid “could possibly be an early biological marker for autism,” said Mark Shen, the lead author of the article, published in Biological Psychiatry, and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina’s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service\n\nSuch a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present.\n\n“The earlier we can get biological markers for autism, the earlier intervention can be initiated, and the greater the chance of better outcomes, ” said David Kennedy, Ph.D., co-director of the Child and Adolescent NeuroDevelopment Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Typically, therapists work with children and parents to improve eye contact, social interactions and communication skills.\n\nRelated: See the special bond between a boy with autism and a deaf shelter dog\n\nThe study results are “very exciting,” said Dr. Adriania Di Martino, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Medical School. Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. It may also be a mechanism in the development of autism, and it opens up new possibilities for research, she said. “You can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid.”\n\nShen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid. Normally, the liquid, refreshed four times a day, washes away byproducts that build up in the brain. But if the fluid is not flowing properly, these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation, which could “hamper brain development” and lead to autism, said Shen.\n\nCompletely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino. More studies are needed, they said.\n\nRelated: De Niro says 'find the truth on vaccines'. But scientists already did\n\nParents with children with autism should not rush to their pediatrician demanding brain MRIs for younger siblings, Shen said.\n\n“We wouldn’t recommend that every high-risk infant get an MRI until we know that the accuracy can be improved closer to the 90 percent range” from the current 70 percent, Shen told TODAY.\n\nHe and his colleagues are working on improving accuracy by combining their brain fluid findings with other recent research. In addition to flushing out the brain’s garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow. In a study published last month in Nature, 80 percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism.\n\n“We’re going to combine those two markers to see if we can improve the prediction closer to the 90 percent range, where it could be really clinically useful,” said Shen.\n\nAbout 1 in 68 children develop autism in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, But as many as 20 out of 100 infants with an older sibling with autism will develop the disorder, said Di Martino.""]","Using a number of sources to provide perspective, it also discussed the need for more research to better refine the test.","This Today.com story addresses an issue of desperate concern to parents of autistic children: the possibility of spotting signs of autism earlier than age two or three, which is the development stage at which autism is typically identified.
The story did a good job explaining the study’s design and how the benefits were measured. Using a number of sources to provide perspective, it also discussed the need for more research to better refine the test.
That said, the story would have been stronger if it had discussed the “big picture” of early markers for autism, and where this latest research fits in with that. It also needed more on the harms of a screening test like this.

Others who do not respond to metformin alone are given a second drug to help them maintain normal blood sugar levels. The researchers noted that which drug they should be prescribed is unclear.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that most patients are prescribed a class of drugs called sulphonylureas to supplement metformin. However, these drugs can sometimes lead to hypoglycemia and weight gain, which increases the patients\' risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nTo compare the effects of linagliptin to glimepiride (the most commonly used sulphonylurea), the researchers conducted a double-blind study over the course of two years. The study, which was funded by linagliptin\'s maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, involved 1,500 people from 16 countries with type 2 diabetes. None of the patients had responded to metformin alone.\n\nAlthough the effectiveness of the drugs were similar, the study showed the side effects of linagliptin were much less severe than those of glimepiride. The researchers found that 7 percent of patients on linagliptin experienced hypoglycemia, compared to 38 percent of patients treated with glimepiride.\n\nThe patients on linagliptin also had fewer heart attacks and strokes compared to those being treated with glimepiride.\n\nThe researchers argued that since linagliptin allows the body to increase the amount of insulin it produces in a glucose-dependent way, the risk for hypoglycemia may be significantly lower.\n\nAnd since hypoglycemia ""can have substantial negative clinical consequences"" in terms of risk for death, illness, mental function and poor quality of life, preventing it is crucial, study co-author Baptist Gallwitz, of Tubingen University Hospital, said in a news release.\n\nThe study authors pointed out linagliptin was licensed in 2011 and this is the first long-term study examining its safety and effectiveness. They added more research is needed to confirm their findings.\n\nOne expert said patients and doctors may still have to balance the superiority of linagliptin against its higher cost in comparison to older drugs.\n\nThe new study provides more evidence that drugs like linagliptin ""are just as good as the old standby sulfonylurea therapies, with the added benefits of inducing fewer hypoglycemic events, causing less weight gain, along with a likely decrease in cardiovascular events,"" said Dr. Stuart Weiss, an endocrinologist at NYU Langone Medical Center and clinical assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine, New York City.\n\nBut millions of Americans suffer from type 2 diabetes, so ""cost issues favoring sulfonylureas may be the only reason for preferring continued sulfonylurea use,"" he added. The results of a larger, ongoing study currently underway may help resolve the issue of whether the newer drug is worth the extra money, Weiss said.\n\nThe study was published online June 27 in The Lancet.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Diabetes Association provides more information on type 2 diabetes.']",This diabetes drug story hits most of the marks but may leave readers wanting more data.,"This tightly written comparison of the side effects from a new diabetes drug compared to the most popular drugs on the market answers most of our questions but should have provided more hard numbers to address benefits, harms and costs.

Indeed, the researchers found a difference between autistic brains and typical brains in the level of responsiveness in language areas, Hirsch noted.\n\n""What we can measure are signals in the brain, in a specific language area, that are depressed in autistic children and normal in typical children,"" she said.\n\nAlthough this study was done with school-aged children and teens, the same test can be done with children as young as 18 months, Hirsch noted. ""We know this technique can be used on young children,"" she said.\n\nThe report was released in the May 31 online edition of Radiology, in advance of publication in the August print issue.\n\nFor the study, 12 children with autism and 15 children without the condition underwent functional MRI (fMRI) exams. Both groups of children ranged in age from 4 to 17 years.\n\nWhile the children were undergoing the fMRI, the researchers played recordings of their parents talking to them and watched for brain activity in areas of the brain responsible for hearing and understanding language.\n\nThe researchers found no differences in the activity in the hearing area of the brain between the two groups. However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch\'s group noted.\n\nTo further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children\'s Medical Center of New York in Lake Success, said that ""although the investigators did indeed find significant differences on neuroimaging between controls and autistic children, the clinical utility from a diagnostic standpoint is unclear.""\n\nThere are important limitations to the study, Adesman said.\n\nFor one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.\n\n""It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed,"" he explained.\n\n""The other major limitation of this study is that the investigators did not look at whether these brain differences are specific to children with autism, or if they would also be seen, for example, in children with language delays who are not autistic,"" Adesman said.\n\nHirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.\n\n""There are questions about how this varies across the severity of autism. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?"" she asked. ""These are things that aren\'t known.""\n\nFurther work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. ""This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,"" she said.\n\nThis test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Robert F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that ""it\'s nice to have an objective measure, but it doesn\'t really do much.""\n\nUltimately, he said, ""the diagnosis of autism is a clinical diagnosis. I see this as having more implications for research into the pathophysiology of autism.""\n\nHowever, if this test could be done in really young children, it might help identify autism so that treatment can begin early, Lopez-Alberola suggested. ""We know the earlier we begin interventions, the greater the likelihood of better outcome,"" he said.\n\n""Although this technique holds promise for identifying infants at risk for autism, it still needs to be determined whether the atypical patterns of brain activation are specific to autism,"" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for Autism Speaks.\n\n""It is possible that children who have delayed language but not autism would also show the same pattern. Regardless, this research is promising as a method for identifying young children at risk for autism,"" Dawson said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on autism, visit the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story asks most of the right questions and provides many good answers.</span>"," If it had spent a little more time quantifying the potential benefits of this screening, and if it had discussed any of the potential harms, it would have earned a higher rating.

Results from a pivotal study of the treatment were reported today in the American Heart Association (AHA) journal Circulation Research.

""Coronary artery disease involves not only the blockage of major arteries, but the death of small vessels, or capillaries, of the heart muscle,"" he says.

Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.\n\nAccording to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.\n\n""There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an \'ACE inhibitor-first\' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,"" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.\n\n""We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,"" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.\n\nBoth ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.\n\nAngiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin II, while ARBs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that older ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs. But, this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs, greater emphasis on quitting smoking, and wider use of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.\n\nHowever, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.\n\n""This is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents, except for better tolerability of ARBs,"" Bangalore said.\n\n""The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs,"" he added.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about blood pressure drugs, visit the American Heart Association.']","Leaning too heavily on a news release, this HealthDay story communicates the main findings adequately but lacks depth and nuance. A competing ","This brief HealthDay story explains the findings of a study by New York researchers comparing two classes of drugs — angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors versus newer angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs — used to treat cardiovascular disease.  It reports on a meta-analysis of more than 100 studies comparing either drug with a placebo or with each other and finds that both types of medications are equally effective.  The only difference being that ARBs tend to produce fewer cases of dry cough as a side effect than do ACE inhibitors.
This story is shorter and less nuanced than a competing Washington Post piece, and it relies excessively on a New York University news release. There is more information about the underlying mechanism of these drugs, something probably of less interest to readers, but less about what is new about this study and why it may be important. The story never clarifies what outcomes we’re talking about with this research — blood pressure, heart attacks, deaths? In addition, the emphasis on the finding of better tolerability does not discuss why this may be – there’s no mention of the greater likelihood of cough and angioedema with ACEIs. Finally, the statement about cost may be somewhat misleading.

Estimates from the most recent Adult Dental Health Survey in the UK suggest around one in ten people suffers from dental phobia.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a short-term therapy, typically lasting 6-10 sessions. CBT has been shown to help with a range of psychological problems, most notably for depression and anxiety-related disorders. Both cognitive and behavioural interventions have been shown to be successful in reducing dental anxiety and increasing dental attendance.\n\nThe latest study, published in the British Dental Journal, looked at the characteristics of 130 patients (99 women and 31 men) attending a psychologist-led CBT service and the outcomes of their treatment. Patients attending a clinic run by the King\'s College London Dental Institute Health Psychology Service at Guy\'s and St Thomas\' NHS Foundation Trust were surveyed for their levels of dental anxiety, general anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, alcohol use and oral health-related quality of life.\n\nThree-quarters of those assessed scored 19 or higher on the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS), indicating dental phobia. The remainder all scored high on one or more items of the MDAS, suggesting a specific fear of some aspect of dentistry. Fear of dental injections and the dental drill were the most common high scoring items on the MDAS. Nearly all patients (94%) reported a knock-on effect from problems with their teeth, mouth or gums on their daily living and quality of life.\n\nA proportion of the patients surveyed were found to have other psychological conditions - 37% had high levels of general anxiety and 12% had clinically significant levels of depression. Suicidal thoughts were reported by 12% of patients and four (3%) reported a recent intent to commit suicide. Individuals were referred to support services via the care of their GP and for suicide risk, immediate action was taken based on local service guidelines.\n\nOf all patients referred, four-fifths (79%) went on to have dental treatment without the need for sedation and 6% had their dental treatment under sedation. The average number of CBT appointments required before a patient received dental treatment without sedation was five.\n\nProfessor Tim Newton from the Dental Institute at King\'s College London and lead author of the study said: ""People with dental phobia are most commonly given sedation to allow them to become relaxed enough for a short period of time to have their dental treatment performed. However this does not help them to overcome their fear in the long term. The primary goal of our CBT service is to enable patients to receive dental treatment without the need for sedation, by working with each individual patient to set goals according to their priorities. Our study shows that after on average five CBT sessions, most people can go on to be treated by the dentist without the need to be sedated.""\n\n""However, there is a need for people with dental phobia to be carefully assessed by trained CBT practitioners working with dental health professionals. Some of the patients referred to us were found to be experiencing additional psychological difficulties, and needed further referral and management. CBT provides a way of reducing the need for sedation in people with a phobia, but there will still be those who need sedation because they require urgent dental treatment or they are having particularly invasive treatments. Our service should be viewed as complementing sedation services rather than as an alternative, the two together providing a comprehensive care pathway for the ultimate benefit of patients.""\n\nA recent study published in the same journal, co-authored by Professor Tim Newton, showed that more women than men reported dental phobia in the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey. Those with dental phobia were more likely to come from a lower income background, have more caries in their teeth and suffer from poorer oral health overall.\n\n###']",Somewhat useful findings from a study that examined how patients with dental phobias responded to cognitive behavior therapy as an alternative to sedation. But what types of sedation and what kinds of procedures?,"The release focuses on a paper published in the British Dental Journal  that evaluated the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on patients with dental phobia or related fears concerning dentistry. The release reports that CBT allowed many patients with dental phobia to receive dental care without relying on sedation, and that CBT and sedation complement each other as ways of helping patients with dental phobia address their dental health needs. The release did a good job describing benefits but was very vague on what researchers meant by the term “sedation” and the types of procedures most feared by those with phobias. In addition, the release didn’t delve into any of the limitations of this study, which was essentially a case series — considered a very low level of evidence.

The biopharmaceutical company reports earnings on Tuesday. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith\n\nThe 12-week trial, presented this week at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, involved 246 patients suffering four to 14 migraine headaches a month who had tried two to four preventive treatments that either did not work for them or had intolerable side effects.\n\n“This is a trial in really difficult to treat patients,” professor Uwe Reuter, trial investigator and managing medical director at Charité Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said previous studies excluded patients who had tried more than two other treatments.\n\nReuter said the 17-point gap between the treatment and placebo groups was in line with previous Aimovig studies.\n\nAimovig, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is likely to be the first drug in a new class designed to target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which plays a key role in migraine activation. A decision by the FDA is due by May 17.\n\nAmgen has partnered with Novartis AG to co-commercialize Aimovig in the United States, while Amgen has rights to the drug in Japan and Novartis has rights to commercialize in rest of world. The drug, a monoclonal antibody, was given monthly by injection at a dose of 140 mg for the trial.\n\nSimilar drugs are under development at companies including Eli Lilly & Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, but Amgen emphasizes that Aimovig is the only one that targets the CGRP receptor pathway, rather than CGRP itself.\n\nAimovig has the “potential to help fill treatment gaps in more difficult patient populations whose migraine has not been adequately managed with current therapies,” Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said in a statement.\n\nAmgen said Aimovig trial patients also had statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in secondary trial goals including fewer monthly migraine days and better physical function.\n\nResearchers said no Aimovig patients stopped treatment due to side effects, while around 1 percent of placebo patients discontinued because of side effects.\n\nAnalytics firm GlobalData has forecast that CGRP antibodies will generate combined sales of $4 billion by 2026.""]","The drug reduced migraines “by at least half in 30 percent of patients who had failed up to four previous treatments,” according to the story. These statistics needed to be explained more clearly.","Getty Images
This story about an experimental migraine drug delivered a superficial and imbalanced account of new study results. Leaning heavily on an Amgen news release, the story explains, rather confusingly, that the drug, Aimovig, “reduced episodic migraines by at least half in 30 percent of patients who had failed up to four previous treatments, while 14 percent of placebo patients achieved that goal.”
This result suggests that the drug might be useful for a small number of patients who aren’t helped by other treatments. It also suggests that the majority of such patients won’t benefit from the drug or will only experience a very modest reduction in symptoms. It would have been very helpful to estimate what proportion of migraine sufferers fall into the subpopulation that might stand to benefit.
The story also didn’t provide important information about potential harms of the drug or address limitations of the study, such as its relatively short (3 month) duration. These deficiencies could have been addressed with the inclusion of an independent expert voice; however, the only sources in the story were the trial’s lead researcher and an Amgen executive.

But new, less-invasive treatments are making it easier to remove them painlessly, bypassing a difficult surgical procedure that was often the only option in the past.\n\nAs many as 25% of women and 15% of men suffer from varicose veins; over the age of 50, one out of two people are affected. Heredity plays a part, but obesity, prolonged standing on the job and hormone therapy increase the risks. Sometimes, varicose veins have no signs or symptoms and require no treatment, though doctors may recommend wearing compression stockings and elevating the legs. Exercise can also help relieve pain. But often, varicose veins can be disabling and dangerous, as well as a warning sign of more serious problems in the circulatory system.\n\nWhile vein problems aren\'t related to artery problems—such as those that can cause heart disease—serious complications of varicose veins can include deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot that can travel to the lungs and cause death, and venous ulcers, shallow wounds that develop on the lower leg and can be hard to heal. Veins near the surface of the skin can also rupture and bleed heavily.\n\nValve Trouble\n\nNormally, the heart pumps blood filled with nutrients and oxygen to the entire body through the arteries, and then veins carry the blood from the body back up to the heart. The exact cause of varicose veins isn\'t known, but they develop when one-way valves in the veins that prevent blood from flowing backward stop working properly, so blood pools in the superficial veins under the surface of the skin and causes them to get larger and less elastic.\n\nDarren Schneider, director of the Center for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, says determining the right treatment depends in large part on the size and location of the veins. Patients typically need an ultrasound study to see if there are any blood clots in the deeper vein system, and to assess the function of the valves.\n\nSmaller veins can often be treated with sclerotherapy, which involves injecting a chemical solution into the vein to destroy it, and costs $250 to $500 per treatment. For larger veins, doctors may recommend endovascular procedures, which range in price from $2,500 to $3,000. These involve threading a catheter into the vein and directing a heat source such as a laser or radio-frequency device into the vein to incinerate it.\n\nVein procedures are offered by a range of physicians, including vascular surgeons, dermatologists and cardiologists. Dr. Schneider, trained as both a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist, suggests that patients ask if a doctor is board-certified in a vascular specialty, or what specialized training the doctor has received in vein therapy.\n\nThe Old Way\n\nIn a procedure that dates to the 19th century, varicose veins can be removed by stripping—pulling them out with a wire threaded in through an incision. The surgery can cause bleeding, bruising, nerve injuries, scarring and infection, and legs may have to be wrapped with bandages for several weeks.\n\nWhile some veins may still require stripping surgery, most can be treated with less invasive therapies. Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved an injectable drug for sclerotherapy that has been widely used in Europe for years, polidocanol—sold under the brand name Asclera—for use in the tiniest varicose veins, known as spider veins, and for so-called reticular veins that are one to three millimeters in diameter.\n\nThe drug has a strong safety record, and it also has anesthetic properties, which makes treatments more comfortable for patients, according to Suman Rathbun, director of the vascular medicine program at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City. Although Asclera isn\'t approved to treat large veins, Dr. Rathbun and others are using it off-label for that purpose, converting the liquid into a foam. When injected, Dr., Rathbun says, it fills the vein better than the liquid, which sometimes leaks out, making it less effective.\n\nLaser Procedures\n\nStudies have shown that minimally invasive endovenous laser procedures that use local anesthesia are highly effective for removing the so-called saphenous veins—a large one that runs from the foot to the thigh and a smaller one up the back of the leg behind the knee—and have a high rate of success over time.\n\nNancy Neukam, 67, says she decided to try the procedure because the bulging blue varicose veins in her lower left leg were increasingly unsightly and painful. Though she feared treatment would be painful and difficult, Ms. Neukam took half a Valium and slept, feeling nothing as Baltimore dermatologist Robert Weiss guided a catheter and laser tip into the vein to seal it closed in 40 minutes.\n\nMs. Neukam had to wear compression stockings for three days afterward and had some bruising, but now, she says, ""I play golf and don\'t mind wearing a skirt or Bermuda shorts anymore, and my legs look and feel wonderful.""\n\nMs. Landro is an assistant managing editor for The Wall Street Journal and writes the paper\'s Informed Patient column. She can be reached at next@wsj.com.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The tone of disease-mongering was our biggest concern with this column.

All for about four bucks a bottle.\n\nThose impressive claims helped the company rack up $91 million in sales in 2009. They also earned the disapproval of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Last month, the agency sued POM Wonderful for making ""false and unsubstantiated"" health claims, and is asking the company to remove the claims from its ads.\n\nA 100 percent juice drink that contains antioxidants (and no added sugar), POM is just one of many beverages that bill themselves as promoting better health. VitaminWater, kombucha tea, coconut water, and various brands of juice drinks made from acai, goji berry, and mangosteen have all used health claims in their marketing -- and some, like POM, have been the subject of scrutiny and legal action.\n\nThe FTC, along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been cracking down on food and beverage makers for allegedly overselling the health benefits of their products. In 2009 alone, the FDA warned 17 companies that they were providing misleading nutritional information on their packaging or making overly specific health claims.\n\nHealth.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat\n\nNot all of the products were drinks, but ""the beverage category stands out,"" says Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. ""At first blush it seems that beverage products are certainly a large proportion of food products that make bogus health-related claims.""\n\nDrinks such as POM have become increasingly popular with consumers in recent years, thanks in part to public health campaigns against soda that have been prompted by the obesity epidemic. ""The trend is away from traditional soda pop [toward] products claiming to provide magical health benefits,"" Silverglade says.\n\nAre the health claims true? Yes and no. The federal government doesn\'t require companies to vet health claims with the agency before plastering them on product packaging (as long as the claims are accompanied by a disclaimer about their uncertainty). But that doesn\'t mean the claims are invented -- most are based in research.\n\nThe research is often funded by the manufacturers, however, and industry-funded research can be prone to bias. A 2007 study found that research on health drinks that was funded entirely by beverage companies was between four and eight times more likely to find a favorable result than research with no industry support.\n\n""If a cell phone company told you they tested all the models and their model came out the best, would you believe it? Probably not,"" says Dr. Lenard Lesser, M.D., one of the co-authors of that study and a researcher at UCLA. ""The same is true with nutrition research, but the stakes are higher because we\'re putting our bodies at risk.""\n\nWhere\'s the line between research and marketing?\n\nSounds great, hard to believe\n\nHowever far-fetched the claims may sound, POM is standing behind them. (Two weeks before the FTC publicly announced its lawsuit, POM preemptively sued the FTC, claiming that preapproval of ads featuring health claims violates the company\'s right to free speech.)\n\nBut are shoppers really convinced that POM can unclog their arteries, cure cancer, and lead to hotter sex?\n\nThere seem to be more than a few believers out there. ""\n\nI started drinking POM after reading the studies two years ago, my triglycerides were almost 1000!,"" one of POM Wonderful\'s 12,000 fans breathlessly posted on Facebook after the FTC announced its lawsuit. ""Working out everyday, drinking POM, and eating healthy, they are now less than 400. Forget what the Feds say! I believe!!!"" (A triglycerides level of 400 is still nearly three times higher than what\'s considered normal.)\n\nMost health beverage drinkers aren\'t as enthusiastic as the realtor from Alaska who posted the above testimonial. Quinton Ma, a 22-year-old marketing coordinator at Gawker Media, in New York City, started to drink VitaminWater as a middle schooler because it seemed like a healthy alternative to soda.\n\n""I figured that if they were selling something that I could get extra vitamins from, it couldn\'t hurt to drink,"" Ma says. ""Once I learned they were really just cleverly marketed sugar waters, I stopped.""\n\nHealth.com: You are what you drink\n\nBut the fact is, even when people don\'t buy the health claims they often still buy the beverage. That\'s the paradox of products such as POM, Silverglade says: The health claims on these products strain the imagination, yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food.\n\nThat\'s because these claims -- however improbable they may seem -- distract shoppers from the real nutritional information and hook consumers with buzzwords like ""antioxidant.""\n\nThis phenomenon is known as a ""health halo,"" an aura of healthfulness attached to a product based on labels like ""low-fat"" ""all-natural"" or ""made with whole grains"" that seduces consumers into overeating. According to a study by the FTC, this halo effect can even lead people to overlook warning statements -- about the high sodium content of a product, for example.\n\n""A healthy halo develops around products like these,"" says Frances Largeman-Roth, R.D., Health magazine\'s senior food and nutrition editor. ""The health-conscious consumer incorporates them into their lifestyle, thinking that they\'re doing a world of good for themselves.""\n\nHealth.com: Food label know-how: 5 mistakes even savvy shoppers make\n\nCeating a health halo\n\nThe makers of POM Wonderful have spent $34 million on scientific research on POM products and pomegranates. According to the FTC\'s complaint, the studies POM has funded do not substantiate the company\'s claims, and a closer look at the research seems to bear that out.\n\nOne of the most prominent claims, that POM can decrease arterial plaque by 30 percent, was taken from a single pilot study that included just 19 people and was funded by the makers of POM. Another claim, that POM drinkers experience a 17 percent improvement in blood flow, was taken from another POM-funded study that included just 45 people and only lasted for three months.\n\n""These days it\'s possible for a food company to pay just about anybody to conduct a study,"" says Silverglade.\n\nMichael Aviram, Ds.C., a cholesterol researcher at Rambam Medical Center, in Haifa, Israel, defended his studies on pomegranates -- many of them funded by POM -- by noting that they were published in ""very prestigious peer reviewed journals,"" including the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and Atherosclerosis. Dr. Harley Liker, M.D., a physician at UCLA Medical Center who has also led research funded by POM, directed all inquiries to a POM spokesman.\n\n""A grocery store is a designed marketing environment to get people to buy things,"" says Lesser. ""Lots of products are going to try to use health claims from research, often from their own industry, [just] to sell a product.""\n\nHealth.com: 14 health products you probably don\'t need\n\nIffy health claims don\'t mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs, says Keri Gans, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. As long as consumers limit themselves to 8-ounce servings and products with no added sugar, juice can be an excellent source of vitamins and other nutrients, Gans says. But it\'s ""not going to solve any of your health issues,"" she adds.\n\nThe bottom line is that consumers shouldn\'t believe everything they read on labels. ""If they focus on consuming an overall well-balanced diet, they might not need to focus so much on finding a product that makes false promises,"" Gans says.\n\nCopyright Health Magazine 2011']",This Health.com story (not reported by but simply republished by CNN.com) did an excellent job of picking apart the claims made by POM Wonderful pomegranate juice and other beverages that are promoted as health products.,"As the story points out, these claims are usually based on very thin evidence from manufacturer-funded studies. The story also included some good background information on why food manufacturers are so tempted to stretch the truth when making these claims. The short answer is that the claims help sell products even when they are not believable.
We would like to have seen some more details on the studies POM cites in support of its promotional statements. Apart from this and a few other minor shortcomings, however, the story met our expectations for quality journalism.

The study was supported by the National Institute on Aging and the Judith Zwartz Foundation.\n\nThe age-related memory loss and thinking problems of participants in the study who reported eating seafood less than once a week declined more rapidly compared to those who ate at least one seafood meal per week.\n\n""This study helps show that while cognitive abilities naturally decline as part of the normal aging process, there is something that we can do to mitigate this process,"" says Martha Clare Morris, ScD, a Rush nutritional epidemiologist and senior author of the paper.\n\nFour types of seafood, five types of brain function\n\nThe researchers followed 915 people with a mean age of 81.4 years for an average of five years. At study enrollment, none had signs of dementia. The participants were recruited from people already taking part in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a study of residents of more than 40 retirement communities and senior public housing units across northern Illinois, plus older adults identified through church groups and social service agencies.\n\nDuring the course of the study, each person received annual, standardized testing for cognitive ability in five areas -- episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed. The study group also completed annual food frequency questionnaires, allowing the researchers to compare participants\' reported seafood intake with changes in their cognitive abilities as measured by the tests.\n\nThe questionnaires included four types of seafood: tuna sandwiches; fish sticks, fish cakes and fish sandwiches; fresh fish as a main dish; and shrimp, lobster and crab. The participants were divided into two groups: those who ate at least one of those seafood meals per week and those who ate less than one of those seafood meals per week.\n\nParticipants in the higher seafood consumption group ate an average of two seafood meals per week. Those in the lower group ate an average of 0.5 meals per week.\n\nMaking closer associations\n\nSeafood is the direct nutrient source of a type of omega-3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid) that is the main structural component of the brain. While epidemiologic studies have shown the importance of seafood and omega-3 fatty acids in preventing dementia, few prior studies have examined their associations with specific types of cognitive ability.\n\nIn the new Neurology article, the researchers report associations between seafood consumption and two of the areas of cognitive ability that they tested. People who ate more seafood had reduced rates of decline in the semantic memory, which is memory of verbal information. They also had slower rates of decline in a test of perceptual speed, or the ability to quickly compare letters, objects and patterns.\n\nThe study did not find a significant difference in the rate of decline in episodic memory (recollection of personal experiences), working memory (short-term memory used in mental function in the immediate present) and visuospatial ability (comprehension of relationships between objects).\n\nThe results were the same after researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect memory and thinking skills, such as education, physical activity, smoking and participating in mentally stimulating activities.\n\nFurther, the protective association of seafood was even stronger among individuals with a common genotype (APOE-ε4) that increases the risk of developing Alzheimer\'s disease. The APOE is a gene involved in cholesterol transport to neurons. About 20 percent of the population carries the APOE-ε4 gene, although not everyone who has the gene will develop Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\n###']",This release provides a measured overview of the study but doesn’t address its weaknesses or quantify benefits.,"The news release is a recap of a recent journal article published in the journal Neurology, and reports that older adults who eat seafood at least once per week saw slower declines in two specific cognitive areas (semantic memory and perceptual speed) than older adults who eat less than one serving of seafood per week.

Co-authors of the paper include Robert Akins, PhD, the project principal investigator, who directs the Center for Pediatric Clinical Research and Development at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children; UD molecular biologist Adam Marsh, PhD, who is chief science officer at GenPro; and Karyn Robinson, MS and Stephanie Yeager, MS, of Nemours Biomedical Research.\n\nEarly diagnosis supports early intervention\n\nCerebral palsy is a common yet understudied neurodevelopmental problem in the U.S. In fact, there is no national surveillance here, but the CDC estimates that 1 in 323 American children have the condition. CP is a group of disabilities with a wide spectrum of severity. Spastic CP, the most common type, is a lifelong condition characterized by joint stiffness, spasms, and muscle tightness that affects movement and posture and restricts the activity of affected children.\n\nAlthough most children (85-90%) with cerebral palsy are born with it, diagnosis may be delayed until 2+ years of age. A diagnosis is made by monitoring motor milestones; infants thought to be at risk for CP are enrolled in early intervention programs where their progress is closely watched. New and better ways to identify infants with CP are needed so that interventions can start earlier for more children.\n\nNemours, internationally recognized for its CP center at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, serves a diverse population of more than 3,000 children and young adults with CP, one of the largest programs in the U.S. Clinicians and researchers at Nemours continuously seek to improve the diagnosis and care of CP patients. Funding from the Swank Foundation enabled Nemours to develop a cerebral palsy tissue bank that stores blood and tissue samples from hundreds of surgical patients at Nemours.\n\nIn the study, the research team profiled blood samples collected in a blinded study from children and adolescents 9-19 years to explore whether patients with spastic CP showed differences at the cellular level that routine orthopedic patients (needing ACL repairs, spinal fusions or other surgeries) did not. The researchers identified a strong set of methylation markers, or patterns, that indicate differences in the genome between children with spastic CP and those without it. In a second study, using samples from children aged 2-5 years, the researchers were able to validate their results and predict with 73 percent accuracy whether the blood samples came from children who had CP.\n\n""The evidence suggests that there is some epigenetic connection,"" said Crowgey. ""If we can do a better job of screening for these at time of birth versus waiting for the disorder to be diagnosed at 2 years of age, then potentially we\'ll be able to deliver earlier therapeutics and have better outcomes and lower medical costs."" Medicaid data show that annual medical costs for a child with CP are 10 to 26 times higher than for those without CP.\n\nThe power of data science, analytics and machine learning\n\nThe study leverages a unique statistical method and software platform originally developed by Dr. Marsh at UD and commercialized by GenPro to measure methylation patterns in DNA (a cell\'s genetic code) using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. NGS is a technique that enables scientists to decode DNA faster and more cheaply than traditional DNA sequencing methods. Each person\'s genome, or complete set of DNA, is like a word that\'s the length of 3 billion characters; but spelled with only the letters A, T, C or G. Traditional DNA sequencing techniques decode sections of DNA 700 characters at a time, while NGS takes advantage of parallel computing capabilities, enabling scientists to decode millions of DNA fragments. Subtle changes in a patient\'s physical health are paralleled by changes in DNA methylation, making it a useful tool to understand disease.\n\n""Many of the signals that we pick up are based on immune system shifts--meaning the way a person\'s immune system responds to external stress events. When we find that epigenetic response, or signal, in the genetic sequencing, it provides another line of evidence for clinicians to use in making decisions,"" said Marsh.\n\nThe approach uses sophisticated machine learning techniques and algorithms to sort through hundreds of gigabytes of NGS data looking for these distinct DNA methylation patterns. ""The data set is massive. It\'s not something a human can do. You need infrastructure, machine learning, data analysis, and data science,"" said Crowgey.\n\nPromising results, more testing needed\n\nWhile the study findings indicate that there is a consistent signal present in circulating blood cells of children with spastic CP that remains from early childhood to the teenage years, the researchers say they need to further study samples from different age groups, including teenagers, toddlers, and infants from birth to 2 years. Learning more about methylation signals across ages will allow the approach to be further refined to identify cases and also could provide researchers new clues to understanding the cellular processes involved in advancing CP, and consequently, new therapeutics to manage the disease.\n\n""We\'re still in the early phases, but the results are extremely promising and we\'re excited about the sensitivity of the test that we are seeing in our retrospective analysis,"" said Crowgey. If successful, the researchers say the type of blood test in development also may be useful for other disorders, such as infant leukemia.\n\nAkins was optimistic. ""This is an example of the kind of innovation that can happen when people with different skill sets collaborate. The experimental testing went from idea to validated execution in less than 12 months. We\'re now working toward a goal of eventually forming a clinical diagnostic test and applying it to a broad population."" Akins added that Nemours is in a unique position for such an undertaking with its large CP population, its growing strength in data science and analytics, and its recent acquisition of newborn screening for the state of Delaware. ""Many issues will need to be addressed, but we predict routine screening for CP in the near (<10 years) future,"" he said.\n\n###\n\nThis research is funded by the Delaware Bioscience Center for Advanced Technology, the National Science Foundation, the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, and Nemours.\n\nPull out quote:\n\n""This blood test could be a game changer. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier we can direct therapies at the child. Specifically, high intensity physical therapy and possibly early surgery to prevent more significant problems in the future, and hopefully improve overall function and quality of life."" M. Wade Shrader, MD, Chief, Cerebral Palsy Center, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children\n\nAbout Nemours Children\'s Health System\n\nNemours is an internationally recognized children\'s health system that owns and operates the two free-standing children\'s hospitals: the Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del., and Nemours Children\'s Hospital in Orlando, Fla., along with outpatient facilities in six states, delivering pediatric primary, specialty, and urgent care. Nemours also powers the world\'s most-visited website for information on the health of children and teens, KidsHealth.org, and offers on-demand, online video patient visits through Nemours CareConnect. Nemours ReadingBrightstart.org is a program dedicated to preventing reading failure in young children, grounded in Nemours\' understanding that child health and learning are inextricably linked, and that reading level is a strong predictor of adult health.\n\nEstablished as The Nemours Foundation through the legacy and philanthropy of Alfred I. duPont, Nemours provides pediatric clinical care, research, education, advocacy, and prevention programs to families in the communities it serves.']",A study involving just 22 children with CP and 21 controls and looking at biomarkers faces a lot more scrutiny before it can be called game-changing.,"This release focuses on a small study (22 children with spastic cerebral palsy and 21 controls) that examined whether a new method for sequencing blood samples might be a way of identifying people with cerebral palsy (CP) earlier than the methods used now.
The work centers on the early findings of differences in methylation sequences in the DNA that might point out patients with the disease.  The proposed method of genetic testing is still comparatively expensive and the release makes no mention of costs.  The release gives very little numerical data on the outcomes of the research and neglects to address the harm that might arise from false negatives and false positives, even though the release points out the diagnostic accuracy was only 73% in a pilot study involving younger children. This means at least one in four results were wrong.  The release applies the term “breakthrough” in its headline, when it clearly is no such thing, and states unequivocally in the lead that the test works, although it is far too early to make such claims.

Dr. Kevin Smith says frequent migraine sufferers shouldn't count out the possibility the pain may be from a deviated septum. Photo: BILLY SMITH II, CHRONICLE Photo: BILLY SMITH II, CHRONICLE Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Constant migraines may be from unlikely culprit: a deviated septum 1 / 1 Back to Gallery\n\nIf you suffer from chronic or migraine headaches, Dr. Kevin Smith urges you to consider the real problem might be in your nose.\n\nSmith, an ear, nose and throat and facial plastic surgeon in Houston, has written The Migraine Imposter to help patients find a simpler cure for what can seem like a complex problem.\n\nFor 17 years Smith has treated patients who have been diagnosed with migraine headaches but really have a deviated septum, which occurs when the partition separating the left and right nasal airways becomes displaced.\n\nHe believes this deviation in the nose can touch sensitive tissue that, in turn, triggers episodic headaches, often mistaken as migraines. At least 32 million Americans are believed to be affected by migraines.\n\n“What I am proposing is that if after you are referred to a neurologist and the MRI of your brain turns out negative (for tumor or aneurysm), your next step should be to get a CT scan of the sinuses,” Smith said.\n\nIf a CT scan shows a septal deviation, a 20-minute procedure called a septoplasty can often solve the problem. Smith said that within his practice, some 90 percent of patients have gotten headache relief after a deviated septum is repaired.\n\nSymptoms to watch for include pain in the forehead, temple, area around the eyes, cheeks and top of the head, Smith said.\n\nA deviated septum is often caused by trauma to your nose, such as having broken your nose, he said, adding that many professional athletes who suffer from migraines may actually have a deviated septum caused by contact sports.\n\n“National Football League player Percy Harvin missed a lot of practice because of migraines,” Smith said. “If a deviated septum is caused by trauma and you have an NFL player with migraines who has been subjected to trauma by playing this sport, there is a high likelihood that he has a deviated septum.”\n\nHouston resident Cheryl Guthrie isn't an athlete, but suffered from migraines since she was a little girl.\n\n“Migraines are awful. You really can't function. I had seen Dr. Smith on a program and tucked (the information) away in a drawer,” Guthrie said. “Finally, he was my last resort.”\n\nIf Smith's hunch is correct, he believes septoplasties can have a big impact on finances and help patients find speedier relief. Often, he said, headache sufferers get passed around to doctors of many specialties, from general practitioners to ear, nose and throat specialists and neurosurgeons as well as oral surgeons, opthalmologists and pain specialists.\n\n“These headaches can cost millions of dollars in lost revenue and a shortened career if sports players never find the reason for their headaches,” Smith said. “I also treated one lady who had suffered 15 years and had 14 MRIs performed in the brain before she was diagnosed with a septal deviation. I want to alleviate health care expenses and health care waste for my patients.”\n\nTo diagnose the problem, Smith said he sprays decongestant up a patients nose and then examines it to see if there are any bends in the back of the nose. A CT scan is then used to confirm the septal deviation.\n\nDr. Gina Rizzo of Gulfcoast MRI and Diagnostic Centers, agrees with Smith and urges physicians to consider this simple screening. “A screening of the sinuses should not be overlooked in the case of recurrent headaches that have been ruled out as tumors or aneurysms in the brain,” Rizzo said.\n\nkamaria.monmouth@chron.com""]",Troublingly shallow story on one doctor’s book and his claims of surgical relief of migraines. ,"This story advances the claims of a book author/ear, nose and throat surgeon who says that many patients with migraines actually suffer from migraine-like headaches caused by a deviated septum in the nose. While the idea sounds reasonable enough, what’s lacking here is evidence. Most problematic is that the story unquestioningly passes along the author’s claim — based entirely on his own practice data — that he has a 90% success rate when treating headache patients with deviated septums. That’s a statistic that will probably help sell lots of books and drive more patients to the author’s practice, but we doubt it accurately reflects the benefits that the typical patient can expect from this treatment. Also troubling is the story’s failure to mention any possible harms associated with the surgery promoted in the book. Considering that septoplasty itself can provoke new chronic pain in some patients, this omission is particularly glaring.

Coffee did not decrease the risk of a third type of oral cancer – laryngeal cancer. They looked at nine existing studies and analyzed how much coffee was consumed by more than 5,000 cancer patients and about 9,000 healthy people.\n\nWhile these results are encouraging, it doesn\'t mean we should just go out and start drinking lots of coffee, says Mia Hashibe, lead researcher and an assistant professor in the department of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah.\n\nHashibe points out that the main risk factors for oral cancers are smoking and drinking alcohol. She says the best way to prevent getting these cancers is to not smoke or drink alcohol, rather than drinking lots of coffee. ""We wouldn\'t want to be encouraging people to drink that much [coffee], without people considering the other risks factors,"" Hashibe says. ""Each person needs to think about how they metabolize caffeine or coffee.""\n\nIn the past, there’s been a perception that coffee may be bad for you, according to Dr. Donald Hensrud, chair of preventive medicine at the Mayo Clinic. But he says that newer studies suggest that drinking coffee may actually be good for you. ""Like many things, the evidence changes over time,"" says Hensrud. He adds that when it comes to the link between coffee and head and neck cancer, ""the benefits outweigh the risks and this is just one more piece of that puzzle that supports that.""\n\nIt’s not exactly known why coffee may help prevent these cancers. But coffee contains over 1,000 different chemical compounds, including cancer-fighting antioxidants, and it’s those antioxidants that may provide a “plausible explanation” for reducing the cancer risk, says Hensrud.\n\nOther recent studies suggest coffee may have beneficial effects in other diseases like dementia, diabetes, liver and Parkinson\'s disease. However, coffee alone may not be the answer according to some experts. Dr. Dong Shin, a head and neck specialist at Emory Winship Cancer Institute says this new study suggests “there is a hint of beneficial outcomes"" with coffee and oral cancer. But he is concerned that the side effects of coffee are not addressed in this study. Shin says when it comes to preventing cancer, the combination approach is best. He suggests “consuming coffee, tea, veggies, and fruits rather than doing just one thing.""\n\nHensrud adds that there are some drawbacks to drinking too much coffee, including liver damage or increased blood pressure. Other possible side effects from drinking a lot of coffee include insomnia, reflux, heartburn, palpitations, urinary systems and increased fluid intake, says Hensrud. He says coffee can also be addictive and some people may suffer from withdrawal headaches. Too much coffee may make it harder to conceive and can increase the risk of miscarriage.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.\n\nEditor\'s Note: Medical news is a popular but sensitive subject rooted in science.

It was funded by a grant from the government\'s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. ""Acupuncture that we have tested works for pregnant, depressed women,"" said Rachel Manber, a study author and professor at Stanford University. However, ""no single study is enough to make policy recommendations,"" she said.\n\nDepression in pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is associated in some studies with poorer cognitive and emotional development in children. Some have linked depression in pregnancy and low birth weight.\n\nAs many as 14% of pregnant women are thought to develop a significant depression at some point during their pregnancy, according to the study authors, comparable to numbers who suffer from postpartum depression. Antidepressants are generally considered safe for use in pregnancy, but research has been limited and concerns continue to grow, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. One study showed that the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension, a potentially serious lung condition, is significantly greater in newborns whose mother took antidepressants later in pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration recommends that patients and physicians ""carefully consider and discuss together"" the benefits and risks taking antidepressants during pregnancy.""Antidepressants are not an attractive option for many women,"" said Dr. Manber. ""Many women are concerned about using antidepressant medication during pregnancy.""\n\nAcupuncture, based on ancient Chinese medicine, attempts to treat conditions by stimulating points on the body, most often with needles stuck in the skin and moved by hand or electrical stimulation, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\n\nIn the study, 150 clinically depressed pregnant women who weren\'t previously taking antidepressants were randomly assigned to get either acupuncture for depression, acupuncture not specifically designed for depression, or massage for eight weeks. Those who got acupuncture targeting depression had a significantly greater decrease in depressive symptoms, compared with the other women. Some 63% of women in the acupuncture-for-depression group responded to treatment, compared with 44% in the other groups.\n\nThere wasn\'t a difference between the groups in full recovery from the depression. Though this study didn\'t compare acupuncture for depression with another active treatment, the response rates are comparable to those rates from other depression treatments in studies of non-pregnant individuals, Dr. Manber said. And future work needs to examine how acupuncture for depression compares with standard treatment like antidepressants or psychotherapy, as well as who responds to treatment and what the optimal dose of the acupuncture treatment should be.\n\nWrite to Shirley S.

2. By mentioning any harms of the treatment. While acupuncture is very safe, the study did report some pain and bleeding.
3. By seeking the perspective of an independent expert and not simply quoting the lead author of the study.

Peled of Peled Plastic Surgery, San Francisco. He hopes his new technique will ""lower the bar to adoption"" of effective surgical treatment for patients with this debilitating headache condition.\n\nEfficient Approach to Surgery for Chronic Temporal Headache\n\nIn recent years, surgery has emerged as an effective treatment option for selected patients with chronic, severe headaches. Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, these procedures address ""trigger sites"" linked to certain headache patterns.\n\nSevere temporal headaches can result from muscle spasms or enlarged blood vessels putting pressure on specific nerves located on the side of the head--specifically, the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve (ZTBTN) and sometimes the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN). During these operative procedures, surgeons seek to relieve pressure on these nerves or to disconnect the nerves in order to prevent them from triggering future headaches.\n\nThe technique is a new use of an approach that many surgeons are already familiar with: the Gillies incision, used for surgical repair of cheekbone fractures. Dr. Peled found that this short incision, placed in the temple behind the hairline, provides direct access to the ZTBTN and ATN. He describes his initial experience with the new approach in 19 patients.\n\nAll patients had chronic temporal headaches that did not improve with medications. They also had a positive result on preoperative testing--either injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) to temporarily block muscle activity, or local anesthetics to temporarily block the involved nerve. Before and after surgery, headache symptoms were assessed using a standard score, the Migraine Headache Index (MHI).\n\nAs in previous studies, surgery provided significant relief from chronic temporal headaches. Average MHI score decreased from about 132 points before surgery to 52 points afterward. Of the 19 patients, 16 had at least a 50 percent reduction in headache symptoms.\n\nIt\'s unclear why the three remaining patients didn\'t have good improvement, although Dr. Peled notes that two of the three had had temporal headaches for decades before surgery. None of the patients experienced complications, and there was little or no visible scarring.\n\nThe experience supports a growing body of research showing good outcomes with surgery for chronic temporal headaches. Most recently, a study in Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery reported similar results whether the nerve is decompressed or disconnected. However, previous studies have used technically more complex approaches to access the ZTBTN.\n\nThe simplified approach using the Gillies incision combines the advantages of other approaches to chronic temporal headache surgery while minimizing the disadvantages, Dr. Peled believes. He comments, ""This is a straightforward technique and effective procedure that may make it easier for plastic surgeons to adopt and offer surgical options for patients with this debilitating condition.""\n\n###\n\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is published by Wolters Kluwer.\n\nClick here to read ""A Novel Surgical Approach to Chronic Temporal Headaches.""\n\nArticle: ""A Novel Surgical Approach to Chronic Temporal Headaches"" (doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000002051)\n\nAbout Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\n\nFor more than 60 years, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® (http://journals. lww. com/ plasreconsurg/ ) has been the one consistently excellent reference for every specialist who uses plastic surgery techniques or works in conjunction with a plastic surgeon.

One Simple Step Can Cut the Risk,"['En Español\n\nBy Karen Pallarito\n\nHealthDay Reporter\n\nMONDAY, Oct. 9, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Drinking plenty of water each day may have an unexpected benefit -- staving off urinary tract infections, a new study reports.\n\nYoung women plagued by UTIs who drank an additional 6 cups of water each day were nearly half -- 48 percent -- as likely as a control group to have another infection, the study showed.\n\nThe water group also reduced their use of antibiotics by roughly half -- or 47 percent.\n\nWhat\'s more, the amount of time that passed before a woman\'s next UTI and between recurrent infections was longer in the water group than in the control group.\n\nWomen are more prone to UTIs than men, partly due to their anatomy. A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.\n\nStudy author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it\'s thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.\n\n""Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it\'s been known, at least it\'s been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,"" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.\n\nDr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn\'t involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake ""substantial,"" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.\n\n""It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,"" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nDr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study ""may be a game changer"" for antibiotic ""stewardship"" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.\n\nShe cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.\n\n""We might not even need to use antibiotics,"" she said.\n\nThe study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.\n\nHalf of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.\n\nThe remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.\n\nThe women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.\n\nOverall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.\n\nBy contrast, the control group\'s total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.\n\nHooton noted that it\'s not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.\n\n""There\'s no magic in a liter-and-a-half,"" he said.\n\nLikewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water. And while the study involved younger women, he said older women who experience recurrent UTIs may benefit from increasing their daily fluid intake as well.\n\nWhether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output, however, is unclear, Wessells noted.\n\n""In addition, the bother associated with the higher urine output, and feasibility of implementing this water intake strategy across a range of occupations and ages, requires further study as well,"" he said.\n\nResearchers presented the findings Saturday at IDWeek 2017, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.\n\nResearch presented at meetings is generally considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed publication.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on UTIs.']",Health care is full of potential conflicts of interest — not even water consumption is off limits.,"Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are a common problem among women, and this story looks at a possible preventative technique: drinking more water. A study conducted in Bulgaria tracked women over a year, half of whom significantly increased the amount of water they drank.
The story was strong on many points, providing plenty of details on how the study was designed and what the outcomes were. However, it missed the mark in one key area: It didn’t disclose that five of the seven researchers either work or consult for Danone, which makes several brands of bottled water.
That’s important context for understanding the research and some of the frothier claims that it’s generating, such as increased water consumption might eliminate the need for antibiotics.

A new study confirms that it is also effective in the management of postmenopause symptoms such as hot flashes, sleeplessness, vaginal dryness, and anxiety, without serious side effects. The study outcomes are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nThe use of complementary and alternative medicine for the management of menopause symptoms has surged in recent years as women have attempted to identify alternatives to hormone therapy (HT). Although HT is the most effective treatment for managing most menopause symptoms, some women have turned to herbal medicine because they are either not candidates for HT or are concerned about the negative publicity surrounding potential side effects. Fennel, an herb containing essential oils, has phytoestrogenic properties. Phytoestrogens are estrogen-like chemicals in plants that have been used to effectively treat a wide array of menopause symptoms.\n\nIn this small trial of 79 Iranian women aged 45 to 60 years, soft capsules containing 100 mg of fennel were administered twice daily for eight weeks. Improvements were compared between the intervention and placebo groups at four, eight, and 10 weeks, with a significant statistical difference documented. In the end, fennel was concluded to be a safe and effective treatment to reduce menopause symptoms without serious side effects. The study described in the article ""Effect of Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (fennel) on menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women: a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial"" is one of the first clinical studies to examine the benefits of fennel for managing menopause symptoms, even though it had been previously studied and confirmed to manage premenopause symptoms.\n\nThe study was completed in Tehran, Iran, where the average age of women at menopause is younger than in the United States: 48.2 years versus 51 years, respectively. Some of the most common adverse effects of menopause are hot flashes, vaginal dryness, sleep problems, joint and muscular discomfort, exhaustion, irritability, anxiety, and depression.\n\n""This small pilot study found that, on the basis of a menopause-rating scale, twice-daily consumption of fennel as a phytoestrogen improved menopause symptoms compared with an unusual minimal effect of placebo,"" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, executive director of NAMS. ""A larger, longer, randomized study is still needed to help determine its long-term benefits and side effect profile.""\n\n###']","Although the release includes a cautionary quote at the end calling for further study, the headline is far too optimistic for a small study of brief duration.","This news release from the North American Menopause Society makes a brief study of fennel in reducing menopause symptoms sound like the final word on the subject — but we’ve seen many other situations where a larger study debunks a short-term small scale study. 
The release describes results of a small, 10-week pilot study of 79 Iranian women designed to credibly assess the value of the licorice-like herb in reducing hot flashes, insomnia and other symptoms of menopause.
Although the release includes a cautionary quote at the end calling for further study to support the investigators’ claim of benefit, the headline is far too optimistic for a small pilot study. The release lacks numbers to put the claims in context; cost information and potential harms are also left out.
As a result, it will be tough for the intended audience of journalists, or other readers, to determine whether fennel is a truly effective and safe short- or long-term treatment choice.

What\'s more, to date the treatment appears to be safe.\n\nThe study authors noted that MS is a progressively debilitating disease that attacks an individual\'s central nervous system, disrupting the normal brain, spinal cord and optic nerve function.\n\nA classic characteristic of the disease is inflammation, which takes the form of brain lesions.\n\nThe immune system\'s T cells have long been implicated in disease progression, but the notion that B cells may also play a major role is relatively new.\n\nWith this new potential target in mind, researchers configured ocrelizumab to specifically focus on a protein (CD20) found on the surface of certain B cells.\n\nTo test the drug, Kappos and his team recruited patients aged 18 to 55 seeking MS treatment in 79 centers in 20 countries.\n\nThe patients were divided into four groups, treated with: a low dose of ocrelizumab (600 milligrams); a high dose of ocrelizumab (2,000 mg); a well-known MS inflammation treatment known as ""intramuscular interferon beta-1a""; or a sugar pill (placebo). After 24 weeks, some of the doses were adjusted.\n\nThe result: at week 24, all of the patients receiving either dose of ocrelizumab fared better in terms of lesion count than either the placebo or standard treatment groups.\n\nThe number of active lesions had dropped 89 percent more among the 600-mg group compared with those getting a placebo. Similarly, those in the 2,000-mg group experienced a 96 percent bigger drop in lesions. What\'s more, relapse rates were much lower among those taking the new drug, in contrast to those taking a placebo.\n\nThe investigators further noted that even eight months after treatment launch, no serious adverse effects were directly attributable to the new drug.\n\nThat said, Dr. Moses Rodriguez, a professor of neurology and immunology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., disputed the premise that ocrelizumab is shaping up as anything new and innovative.\n\n""In fact, there\'s nothing novel about this at all,"" he said. ""There is another drug, called rituximab, that\'s been in early trials for MS for years. And all this new drug is attempting to do is replicate the same that rituximab already does. And I see no major advantage of this drug versus that older drug. It\'s not better or worse. It\'s the same,"" Rodriguez noted.\n\n""So bottom-line, I would not sell this as a major breakthrough in MS,"" cautioned Rodriguez. ""It\'s not.""\n\nFunding for the study was provided by F.

But here\'s the challenge: How can people be motivated to eat healthier and move more? Increasingly, the answer might include digital medicine.\n\n""Just telling people to do things doesn\'t work,"" says Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health. If it were easy, there wouldn\'t be more than 80 million adults in the U.S. with prediabetes.\n\nOmada has rolled out a digital program, delivered on smartphones and other devices, that incorporates all the ingredients known to help people overhaul their habits. It includes e-coaching; peer support; education; diet and exercise tracking; and electronic nudging. (Forget to weigh in or track your meals? You\'ll get texts or emails reminding you to do it.)\n\n""Week by week we have lessons on different themes, "" Duffy explains. ""They\'re interactive, and there\'s little games"" to keep it dynamic. Participants are matched with a group of peers (online) and they\'re led by a coach, who they can text or email back and forth with. ""We call it the symphony effect,"" Duffy says, because there are multiple methods working together to help participants stay on track.\n\nGetting started\n\nSometimes fear is a good motivator for losing weight. Don Speranza is in his late 60s and lives on a farm along the Columbia River in Washington state, where he runs a bed and breakfast with his wife. He\'s also the chef at the inn. ""I\'m immersed in food all day,"" Speranza says.\n\nLast year he received an email from his doctor at Kaiser Permanente with some test results. ""It was like a gut punch, "" Speranza says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Don Speranza Courtesy of Don Speranza\n\nBased on his weight, which had been crept up to 210 pounds, and the results of his bloodwork to test his glucose, he was diagnosed with prediabetes. This means his blood sugar level was elevated, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with the condition.\n\n""It was a real come-to-Jesus moment,"" Speranza recalls. He knew that diabetes increased the risk of heart disease and can lead to many other complications including vision loss and amputations.\n\nWhen he signed up for the Omada program, the first thing he received was a scale. He began to weigh himself daily. He also began to track what he was eating. Each day he\'d log his weight and meals and upload the data to a dashboard. His coach could see the data, too, and give him advice and encouragement.\n\n""Oh, my coach, "" Speranza says. ""I can\'t sing her praises enough, she was so responsive."" Even though they never met in person, they bonded. He took her advice and suggestions.\n\nHe realized, for instance, that he ate too much of the wrong things. ""Homemade breads and croissants, pasta and pizza,"" Speranza ticks off the list of baked treats with a mix of reverence and resolve in his voice.\n\nSperanza realized he had to change his relationship with these foods. Temporarily, he cut out all these refined carbohydrates. He had to train himself to resist all the treats he bakes for his guests.\n\nInstead, he began to fill his plate with more protein, vegetables and healthy fats. He raises animals on his organic farm, so he eats pastured meats, and a lot of salmon.\n\n""Week by week, I\'d make one or two little changes at a time, "" Speranza says. ""It was a game changer.""\n\nThe weight began to fall off, and he started to move more. His coach nudged him to switch up his morning routine. He says he was accustomed to sitting each morning for an hour or so just drinking coffee. ""Now, I\'ll start the coffee,"" he says, but before he drinks it, ""I\'ll go outside and walk."" He tracks his movement withe a wearable electronic device. He began with 2,000 steps logged during his morning walk but has now increased his steps significantly. And he rides a stationary bike, too.\n\n""Now, I can almost keep up with my wife,"" Speranza says with a laugh.\n\nSince last May, he has lost about 50 pounds (52, to be exact, but it fluctuates a bit) and his blood sugar has returned to the normal range. He no longer has prediabetes.\n\n""I feel so much better,"" Speranza says. As a baker, he buys flour in 50 pound sacks. ""Now, when I look at [the sacks] I\'m aghast to think that\'s what I was carrying around.""\n\nSuccess is not automatic\n\nNot every Omada Health participant makes the progress they\'re aiming for. After all, pulling off these changes is difficult\n\n""I\'m still on the journey to get to more optimal, health"" says Lonny Northrup, who lives in Utah. He lost weight while participating in the program, but when he hit a plateau in his weight loss, he felt stuck and he says he didn\'t get the personal support he would have liked from the program. ""For [many] days in a row I got an email saying, \'Hey, we noticed you didn\'t step on the scale,\' "" he says. ""For some reason that didn\'t get escalated to the coach."" So he says that was a disappointment.\n\nOverall, he says he would recommend the Omada Health program to a friend. ""I got really good, specific recommendations that worked for me and my lifestyle,"" Northrup says. And he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key, too.\n\nThere is some evidence that these kinds of programs are working. A recent pilot study with Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare that included about 200 people, all of whom were at high risk of Type 2 diabetes, found that 75 percent of the participants completed the Omada program and lost at least 5 percent of their body weight. And about 1 in 4 participants lost 7 percent of their body weight or more. That\'s promising, because there\'s evidence that a 7 percent body weight loss cuts the risk of developing diabetes by about 60 percent.\n\n""This is one of the most exciting things,"" says Mark Greenwood, a physician with Intermountain.\n\nOmada Health is not the only player in this space. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes many diabetes prevention lifestyle change programs, delivered both in-person and online, including Vida, which bills itself as a ""health transformation team"" that is data and tech-driven.\n\nAdditionally, traditional players in the weight loss space, such as Weight Watchers, now offer some similar incentives, such as personal coaching.\n\nGreenwood says he\'d like to see many more patients try diabetes prevention programs. And he says he\'s pleased with the results of the pilot study of Omada\'s program.\n\n""The data really does confirm that when you give people tools and help, instead of just preaching to them, it really does help.""']","We always want health stories to mention costs, and for this story on a new, relatively untested weight loss plan, cost seems especially important.","This NPR story profiled a health app that’s comprehensive — providing both diet and exercise tracking, education about healthy habits, personal coaching, electronic nudging, and peer support.
The story featured a patient success story (and one less successful one–which was good to see) and briefly described positive data from a pilot study, leading to a rather upbeat take. However, the article did not provide much context for the technology-based treatment program: How do similar programs compare? What are the costs? What are the long-term outcomes? We think such context, and perhaps a dose of skepticism, is absolutely necessary — especially in the weight loss arena where so many seemingly promising ideas wither over time.

The mineral found in popular supplement pills — and in dairy foods, leafy greens and many fortified foods — is unquestionably good for your bones. But in recent years, doctors have raised concerns that calcium supplements might be over-used and bad for hearts.\n\nRecently, two new studies made headlines. One found a link between the supplements and a build-up of calcium in arteries, a possible precursor to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nA second, wider-ranging study found no heart risks and was the basis of new guidelines from two medical groups saying that calcium supplements should be considered heart safe.\n\n“The public has been receiving very confusing and alarming messages about calcium supplements,” says JoAnn Manson, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston.\n\nAbout 35% of U.S. adults take calcium supplements, alone or in multivitamins, according to a recent report in the medical journal JAMA.\n\nSo here’s what all those people need to know.\n\nConcerns about heart risks may be fading.\n\nOver the past decade, some studies have raised the possibility that calcium, from supplements but not from food, might raise heart risks.\n\nMost recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University tracked nearly 3,000 adults and found that those who took calcium supplements at the study outset were 22% more likely to show artery calcification 10 years later. Those who got the most calcium from food had a decreased risk. But the study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, was not designed in a way that could prove the supplements caused the artery changes.\n\nAnd its findings were quickly refuted by a larger review of 31 previous studies, including some with more rigorous designs. Taken together, those findings suggest healthy adults face no increased heart risks from calcium, in food or supplements, in amounts of up to 2,000-2,500 mg a day, researchers reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The review was funded by the non-profit National Osteoporosis Foundation, with support from Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, which makes calcium supplements.\n\n“If you look at the overall totality of the evidence, there’s a lack of association between supplement use and heart attack and other cardiovascular events,” says Manson, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the review.\n\nThe review “is really reassuring,” says Clifford Rosen, senior scientist at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute at the University of Maine. He was not involved in the research.\n\nAlso reassured: The osteoporosis foundation and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology, which issued new guidelines saying supplements appear heart safe.\n\nNot everyone is convinced.\n\nThe larger review did not include all potentially relevant studies, says Erin Michos, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology who led the Johns Hopkins study. “I’m still concerned about harm from supplements and I don’t advise them for my patients,” she says.\n\nThere are other reasons not to take calcium supplements.\n\nThe first is that most people don’t need them, Rosen says. Calcium intake from food has been rising, he says, with recent surveys finding averages around 1,000 mg a day — close to or meeting the 1,000 mg. to 1,200 mg recommended for adults (the higher level is advised for women over 50 and men over 70). Many people get more than they realize, he says, not just from milk, cheese and yogurt, but from vegetables, grains, and, increasingly, fortified foods and beverages.\n\nWhen there is a gap, food is a better choice than supplements, the experts agree. Calcium-rich foods, such as milk (300 mg a cup), plain yogurt (400 mg per cup) and kale (100 mg a cup), come with added nutritional benefits. And supplements come with extra risks: increases in kidney stones and, for some people, constipation and bloating.\n\nSome people do need supplements.\n\nOlder adults with osteoporosis — bone thinning severe enough to raise the risk of debilitating fractures — can benefit from calcium supplements, Rosen says, though most need just one 500 mg to 600 mg dose a day. Larger doses are poorly absorbed and rarely needed, he says.\n\nAmong others who might need a boost: Vegans, people with lactose intolerance and anyone who, for whatever reason, does not consume enough calcium, says Taylor Wallace, an affiliate professor of nutrition at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and a co-author of the new cardiovascular statement.\n\nTeen girls, who are in crucial bone-building years, often have diets that fall short of their needs, 1,300 mg a day, Wallace says.\n\nYour bones need more than calcium alone.\n\nVitamin D — found in fatty fish, fortified foods and supplements, and produced by the skin in response to sun exposure — also is essential to bone health. Many supplements combine vitamin D and calcium, but experts disagree on who should take those supplements and in what doses. Under current U.S. nutrition guidelines, teens and adults are advised to get 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D each day.\n\nAlso important for bone health: weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, dancing and workouts with weights.']","The story offers guidance to readers about the state of research regarding calcium supplements, providing balanced information they can use to make informed decisions about their health.","The story examines the potential risks and benefits associated with the use of calcium supplements, and discusses two recent studies (found in the Journal of the American Heart Association and the Annals of Internal Medicine) that address the issue.
On the whole, the story is strong: It offers guidance to readers about the state of research regarding calcium supplements, providing balanced information they can use to make informed decisions about their health. Yet, the story would have been stronger if it also had discussed the evidence around taking calcium to prevent osteoporosis-related bone fractures in older women.

She consulted an allergist at Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where a clinical trial involving immunotherapy toothpaste was taking place.\n\nThe toothpaste, called Allerdent, works to keep breath fresh and fight cavities while also offering the same benefits as an allergy shot or drops.

But a milestone study with results published today in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that clot removal up to 24 hours after stroke led to significantly reduced disability for properly selected patients.\n\nThe international multi-center clinical study, known as the DAWN trial, randomly assigned 206 stroke victims who arrived at the hospital within six to 24 hours to either endovascular clot removal therapy, known as thrombectomy, or to standard medical therapy.\n\nThrombectomy involves a catheter placed in the femoral artery and snaked up the aorta and into the cerebral arteries where the clot that is blocking the artery, and causing the neurological symptoms, is retrieved.\n\nAlmost half of the patients (48.6 percent) who had clot removal showed a considerable decrease in disability, meaning they were independent in activities of daily living 90 days after treatment. Only 13.1 percent of the medication group had a similar decrease. There was no difference in mortality or other safety end-points between the two groups.\n\n""These findings could impact countless stroke patients all over the world who often arrive at the hospital after the current six-hour treatment window has closed,"" says co-principal investigator Raul Nogueira, MD, professor of neurology, neurosurgery and radiology at Emory University School of Medicine and director of neuroendovascular service at the Marcus Stroke & Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital.\n\n""When the irreversibly damaged brain area affected by the stroke is small, we see that clot removal can make a significant positive difference, even if performed outside the six-hour window,"" says co-principal investigator Tudor Jovin, MD, director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute. ""However, this does not diminish urgency with which patients must be rushed to the ER in the event of a stroke. The mantra \'time is brain\' still holds true.""\n\nTo select patients for the trial, the researchers used a new approach which used brain imaging and clinical criteria as opposed to just time alone.\n\n""Looking at the physiological state of the brain and evaluating the extent of tissue damage and other clinical factors seems to be a better way to decide if thrombectomy will benefit patients as opposed to adhering to a rigid time window,"" says Nogueira.\n\nThe researchers planned to enroll a maximum of 500 patients over the course of the study period. However, a pre-planned interim review of the treatment effectiveness after 200 patients were enrolled in the trial led the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board overseeing the study to recommend early termination of the trial, based on pre-defined criteria demonstrating that clot removal provided significant clinical benefit in the studied patients.\n\n""Our research and clinical teams are immensely proud of these breakthrough findings, which are so profound they will likely result in a paradigm shift that will not be seen again for many years in the field of stroke therapeutics,"" says Michael Frankel, MD, professor of neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, chief of neurology and director of the Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center for the Grady Health System.\n\nAccording to Frankel, the Emory neuroscience team was a major contributor to the DAWN trial, working at Grady Memorial Hospital, the second leading site of the trial\'s enrollment.\n\nThe DAWN trial included trial locations in the United States, Spain, France, Australia and Canada. The trial was sponsored by Stryker Corporation, a medical technology company that manufactures the clot removal devices used in the study.\n\nThe DAWN trial results were presented at the European Stroke Organization Conference in May.\n\n###']","While the release provides good supporting data, readers should remember that the study was not blinded or placebo controlled which introduces some limitations.","This news release from Emory University describes  findings of a randomized clinical trial that showed  positive outcomes among almost half of stroke patients whose brain blood clots were removed well outside the time frame of six hours currently recommended by stroke experts.
The release properly discloses that the study was funded by a company that makes the clot removing device and quotes investigators from one of the participant investigators not at Emory.
The release could have been stronger had it disclosed details about the patients (such as age, and their co-occurring conditions, race, gender); the size of the population of stroke victims in the U.S. likely to benefit from “late” clot removal; and limitations of the study (e.g. follow up was for 90 days, not long term). Some details on which stroke victims are considered eligible for clot removal within six to 24 hours and the costs of the clot removal procedure itself would have been helpful.

Gains after two years were about the same for Eylea and Lucentis (ranibizumab), contrary to year-one results from the study, which showed Eylea with a clear advantage. The three drugs yielded similar gains in vision for patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment. The clinical trial was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), which is funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“This rigorous trial confirms that Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all effective treatments for diabetic macular edema,” said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D. “Eye care providers and patients can have confidence in all three drugs.”\n\nEylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all widely used to treat DME, a consequence of diabetes that can cause blurring of central vision due to the leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in the retina. The macula is the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The drugs are injected into the eye and work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance that can promote abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage. Although the drugs have a similar mode of action, they differ significantly in cost. Based on Medicare allowable charges, the per-injection costs of each drug at the doses used in this study were about $1850 for Eylea, about $60 for Avastin, and about $1200 for Lucentis.\n\nDRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. When the study began, participants on average were 61 years old with 17 years of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Only people with a visual acuity of 20/32 or worse were eligible to participate (to see clearly, a person with 20/32 vision would have to be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal vision could see clearly at 32 feet). At enrollment, about half the participants had 20/32 to 20/40 vision. The other half had 20/50 or worse vision. In many states, a corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in at least one eye is required for a driver’s license that allows both day- and nighttime driving.\n\nEach participant was assigned randomly to receive Eylea (2.0 milligrams/0.05 milliliter), Avastin (1.25 mg/0.05 mL), or Lucentis (0.3 mg/0.05 mL). Participants were evaluated monthly during the first year and every 4-16 weeks during the second year. Most participants received monthly injections during the first six months. Thereafter, participants received additional injections of assigned study drug until DME resolved or stabilized with no further vision improvement. Subsequently, injections were resumed if DME worsened. Additionally, laser treatment was given if DME persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections. Laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for DME until widespread adoption of anti-VEGF drugs a few years ago.\n\nAmong participants with 20/40 or better vision at the trial’s start, all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart. On average, participants’ vision improved from 20/40 vision to 20/25.\n\nAmong participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial’s start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines, compared with visual acuity before treatment. Eylea outperformed Avastin at the one- and two-year time points. While Eylea outperformed Lucentis at the one-year time point, by the two-year time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different. At the end of the trial, average visual acuity was 20/32 to 20/40 among participants in all three groups.\n\n“The results of the DRCR Network’s comparison of Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy,” said John A. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. “The study suggests there is little advantage of choosing Eylea or Lucentis over Avastin when a patient’s loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild, meaning a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, patients with 20/50 or worse vision loss may benefit from Eylea, which over the course of the two-year study outperformed Lucentis and Avastin.”\n\nThe number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups. Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year.\n\nThe need for laser treatment varied among the three treatment groups. By two years, 41 percent of participants in the Eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema, compared with 64 percent of participants in the Avastin group and 52 percent in the Lucentis group.\n\nThe risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by end of the trial was higher among participants in the Lucentis group. Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of participants in the Avastin group. This difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies, and therefore may be due to chance. Continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies. Cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke are common complications of diabetes. The occurrence of eye complications, such as eye infections and inflammation, was similar for all three drugs.\n\nResults of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Eylea and Lucentis were provided by drug manufacturers Regeneron and Genentech, respectively. Additional research funding for this study was provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, also a part of NIH.\n\n“This important study would not have happened without funding from the National Institutes of Health and the cooperation of two competing companies,” said Adam R. Glassman, M.S., principal investigator of the DRCR.Net Coordinating Center at the Jaeb Center for Health Research.\n\nThe DRCR.net is dedicated to facilitating multicenter clinical research of diabetic eye disease.

The trial found that all three commonly prescribed drugs were effective in treating DME but that among patients with 20/50 vision or worse, Eylea led to better outcomes than Avastin. In patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment, all three drugs were equally effective. Fewer of the patients receiving Eylea needed corrective laser treatment to meet a visual acuity of 20/40, which is necessary to pass a driving exam (41% versus 64% for those getting Avastin and 52% who received Lucentis).

The drug is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is used to detect the FLT3 mutation in patients with AML.\n\n\n\nAML is a rapidly progressing cancer that forms in the bone marrow and results in an increased number of white blood cells in the bloodstream. The National Cancer Institute estimated that approximately 19,930 people would be diagnosed with AML in 2016 and 10,430 were projected to die of the disease.\n\n“Rydapt is the first targeted therapy to treat patients with AML, in combination with chemotherapy,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence. “The ability to detect the gene mutation with a diagnostic test means doctors can identify specific patients who may benefit from this treatment.”\n\nRydapt is a kinase inhibitor that works by blocking several enzymes that promote cell growth. If the FLT3 mutation is detected in blood or bone marrow samples using the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, the patient may be eligible for treatment with Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Rydapt for patients with AML were studied in a randomized trial of 717 patients who had not been treated previously for AML. In the trial, patients who received Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy lived longer than patients who received chemotherapy alone, although a specific median survival rate could not be reliably estimated. In addition, patients who received Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy in the trial went longer (median 8.2 months) without certain complications (failure to achieve complete remission within 60 days of starting treatment, progression of leukemia or death) than patients who received chemotherapy alone (median three months).\n\nCommon side effects of Rydapt in patients with AML include low levels of white blood cells with fever (febrile neutropenia), nausea, inflammation of the mucous membranes (mucositis), vomiting, headache, spots on the skin due to bleeding (petechiae), musculoskeletal pain, nosebleeds (epistaxis), device-related infection, high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and upper respiratory tract infection. Rydapt should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to midostaurin or other ingredients in Rydapt. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Rydapt because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby. Patients who experience signs or symptoms of lung damage (pulmonary toxicity) should stop using Rydapt.\n\nRydapt was also approved today for adults with certain types of rare blood disorders (aggressive systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm or mast cell leukemia). Common side effects of Rydapt in these patients include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swelling (edema), musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, constipation, fever, headache and shortness of breath.\n\nThe FDA granted this application Priority Review, Fast Track (for the mastocytosis indication) and Breakthrough Therapy (for the AML indication) designations.\n\nThe FDA granted the approval of Rydapt to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The FDA granted the approval of the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay to Invivoscribe Technologies Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###\n\nInquiries Media: Angela Stark 301-796-0397 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA\n\nRelated Information']",More details on benefits and evidence would have improved this already strong news release.,"acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
This release from the Food and Drug Administration announces approval of a new drug, Rydapt (midostaurin), for the treatment of specific acute myeloid leukemia patients who possess certain genetic FLT3 mutations that affect the immune system. It points out that when these patients are identified through the use of a specific test — the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay — then the new drug can be used along with standard chemotherapy until remission and then as a maintenance drug following that.
The descriptions surrounding the benefits of the drug and the evidence are vague. It would have been good to see both absolute and relative benefits included in the release, and a clarification that only about one-third of AML patients will be candidates for this drug treatment.
While there is no mention of the cost of the drug or the test (which FDA releases seldom include), the release provides clear information on harms and how the drug works.

The shot turned off a newly identified cholesterol regulator, PCSK9, which interferes with the liver\'s ability to clear bad cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n\nThe findings were presented Monday at the American Heart Association (AHA) annual meeting in Orlando, Fla. The study was funded by AMG145 manufacturer Amgen Inc.\n\nHigh cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. The first step toward lowering cholesterol is typically lifestyle changes, which include eating a low-fat diet and regular physical activity. For some, medications such as statins must be added to get cholesterol levels where they ought to be. Even this is not enough to get everyone\'s numbers into the safety zone, and not everyone can tolerate currently available medications. An LDL of less than 100 mg/dL of blood is considered optimal.\n\nStudy author Clapton Dias, medical sciences director of clinical pharmacology and early development at Amgen, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said this shot could be given as an add-on to current cholesterol-lowering therapies for people who are not getting as low as they should be or as a standalone treatment for people who can\'t tolerate existing lipid-lowering drugs.\n\n""Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S., and while statins are very effective, a good proportion of people are not meeting their goals, and in this setting the shot could be a valuable addition,"" he said.\n\nThe study included 54 men and two women aged 18 to 45 who did not have elevated cholesterol levels. Participants received one of five doses of the new drug delivered via shot or intravenously or a placebo.

Pour a cup of tea,"[""Next time your fussy, colicky baby has you teetering on the brink of sleep-deprived lunacy, consider a cup of herbal tea.\n\nAnd that's for the baby, not for you.\n\nTea --made with chamomile, licorice, fennel and balm mint-- was one of the most effective treatments for relieving symptoms of colic, according to a new Pediatrics study, which reviewed 15 randomized clinical trials of alternative treatments for infantile colic.\n\nThe study analyzed trials that included various types of treatment and found the most encouraging results came from treatments using herbal remedies and sugar solutions, while the least effective results came from treatments involving manipulation and probiotic supplements.\n\nOf the three herbal studies, one with the most significant results was when babies were given fennel extract. (No surprise since fennel seeds are known to be a natural digestive aid because they relax the smooth muscle lining of the digestive tract and also help to expel gas.) Another study looked at Colimil, an herbal formula containing fennel, lemon balm, and German chamomile, which after use showed a significant difference in crying times per day.\n\nFive studies that looked at glucose and sucrose supplements found significant easing effects on colic symptoms, too.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the study is how the authors explain what many a frazzled parent already knows – that it's hard to know how to treat colic because colic itself is such a wily beast.\n\nThe difficulty in finding an effective treatment is related to our lack of understand of IC (infantile colic). Its pathophysiology is unclear; food allergies, formula intolerance, immaturity of gastrointestinal tract, excessive gas formation or intestinal cramping have all been suggested as possible etiologies.

Results of the technique, called deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS), will be presented Sunday at ENDO 2017, the Endocrine Society\'s 99th annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.\n\nThis study expands on the researchers\' previous finding that dTMS reduced food cravings and induced weight loss in obese individuals. Unlike deep brain stimulation, dTMS does not need an operation or implantation of electrodes. Instead, an electromagnetic coil is placed on the scalp and sends magnetic pulses to stimulate specific deep regions of the brain. Currently approved in the U.S. for treating major depression, dTMS is being studied in some countries for the treatment of other neuropsychiatric disorders, especially addiction.\n\n""We need new safe and effective therapies for obesity,"" said principal investigator Livio Luzi, M.D., professor and head of endocrinology at the IRCCS Policlinico San Donato and the University of Milan in Milan, Italy. ""Despite numerous preventive and therapeutic interventions, none has stopped obesity from reaching epidemic proportions.""\n\nAn underlying cause of obesity may be an impaired gut microbiota composition, an imbalance in the complex mix of beneficial and harmful microorganisms that inhabit the digestive tract. Luzi said scientists now know that an impaired gut microbiota can alter the brain\'s signals for appetite and satiety, or fullness. He and his co-workers studied whether dTMS could improve the gut microbiota composition in obese persons and, if so, by what underlying mechanisms.\n\nIn their study, funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, the investigators recruited three men and 11 women, ages 22 to 65, with obesity as shown by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 45 kg/m2. They randomly assigned the study subjects to two groups for five weeks to receive 15 sessions--three times per week--of either dTMS (to the insula and prefrontal cortex deep in the brain) or a sham stimulation as a control. Before and at the end of treatment, subjects provided stool samples for microbiota analysis.\n\nThe research team also measured blood levels of glucose (sugar), insulin, pituitary gland hormones and neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine. Pituitary hormones play a key role in regulating appetite, and recent research shows that norepinephrine and other neurotransmitters affect microbiota composition, Luzi said.\n\nAfter five weeks of treatment, subjects receiving dTMS lost more than 3 percent of their body weight and more than 4 percent of their fat--significantly more than controls did, Luzi reported.\n\nResults of the fecal analysis demonstrated that, after five weeks, dTMS-treated subjects had greatly increased quantities of several beneficial bacterial species with anti-inflammatory properties, such as are found in healthy people. The control group, however, had no clinically relevant alterations in their microbiota composition, Luzi said. He also reported that changes in the abundance of other bacterial species correlated with improvement of metabolic and hormonal parameters, including glucose, insulin, several pituitary hormones and norepinephrine.\n\n""These changes suggest a beneficial effect of dTMS on both weight loss and change in microbiota composition,"" Luzi said. ""Our research shows the innovative ability of dTMS in exerting anti-obesity effects through alteration of the gut-brain axis.""\n\n###\n\nEndocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers. The Endocrine Society is the world\'s oldest and largest organization of scientists devoted to hormone research and physicians who care for people with hormone-related conditions.']",This release jumps to unsupported conclusions when describing a study based on just 7 volunteers receiving the active treatment.,"The focus of this news release from The Endocrine Society is on research examining the impact of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) — a non-invasive treatment that can stimulate different regions of the brain — on weight loss, hormones and signaling molecules that can affect metabolism and appetite, and composition of the gut microbiome in 14 obese human subjects living in Italy. Microbiome refers to the community of microorganisms living in and on our bodies, most of which are within the gut, and their genetic makeup. 
The results indicated that volunteers who underwent dTMS lost more weight and fat mass than those who had a sham procedure and that changes were seen in the microbiome profile in individuals who’d had dTMS. The release didn’t discuss any changes in the sham group, and there was no discussion of where these results fit within the total body of evidence in this area of research.
Most importantly, the release takes significant liberties by stating that dTMS can directly impact microbes living in the gut, without considering the impact that weight loss and lifestyle changes have on microbial composition.
Employing a more cautious interpretation of the results, and including a discussion of costs, risks, and comparisons to other weight loss treatments would have significantly improved the release.

story_reviews_01440,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3110/,2010-08-26 20:39:44,"Gaining on death, cooling therapy catches on slowly","[""PHILADELPHIA (Reuters Health) - It was a cold, drizzly March morning this year when Ed Sproull’s heart stopped beating.\n\nNurse researcher Marian Leary (top) applies a cooling wrap on research assistant David Fried during a body cooling for trauma patients demonstration at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, June 3, 2010. REUTERS/Tim Shaffer\n\nAt 58, he had arrived at work feeling fit and healthy. As he stepped into the elevator at De Lage Landen Financial Services in Wayne, Pennsylvania, he had no reason to suspect he would end up in a limbo between life and death.\n\nHe collapsed without a sound. He didn’t grab his chest, he didn’t indicate any pain or discomfort, he just closed his eyes and slumped down, coffee in hand. Unbeknownst to the colleague with him in the elevator, Sproull’s heart had entered a state of electric anarchy, no longer pumping out blood.\n\nResponding to the 911 call from De Lage Landen, EMS Captain Chris Griesser of Berwyn Fire Company arrived less than 15 minutes later. He had to cut through a crowd to get to Sproull.\n\n“We shocked him with the AED and we think we have a pulse,” one woman kneeling next to the body told Griesser. Sproull’s shirt had been ripped open, and electrodes from a so-called automated external defibrillator (AED) were glued to his chest. Within a few minutes of the cardiac arrest, a company employee trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) had jolted Sproull’s heart back to its normal rhythm.\n\nStill, it was far from clear that Sproull would survive. He was in a deep coma and barely breathing. If he made it to the hospital alive, chances were his brain would be so profoundly damaged that he would never be able to live a normal life again.\n\nIn fact, the vast majority of the 300,000 Americans who suffer cardiac arrest every year die. Despite massive investments in research and technology, fewer than eight in 100 leave the hospital alive, a rate that has remained stagnant for almost 30 years. Even if the heart is restarted, only a minority make it. And of those who do, many end up in nursing homes with crippling brain injury.\n\nDoctors say those statistics could change, however, if more people had access to a procedure called therapeutic hypothermia - cooling the body. As medical procedures go, it’s among the simplest: Chill the patient about six degrees Fahrenheit — using cold intravenous saline, cooling blankets or ice packs — and wait 24 hours; then re-warm the patient slowly and cross your fingers.\n\nIt’s also the only treatment proven to protect the brain after cardiac arrest. In 2009, an analysis of earlier studies showed it increased the chances that people like Sproull would survive with intact brain function by more than half. Since 2005, it’s been a staple part of resuscitation guidelines, inspiring a newfound can-do attitude in a growing number of emergency physicians across the country.\n\n“We are pushing into the gray zone and grabbing people back,” said Dr. Benjamin Abella, a doctor at the Center for Resuscitation Science at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\n\nYet many hospitals have been slow to pick up the procedure. Those that use it often do so inconsistently, incompletely or with big delays, experts say. What’s more, most emergency medical services still rush cardiac arrest patients off to the nearest hospital, making it a high-stakes geographical gamble whether or not that person gets cooled.\n\n“There are probably thousands of people in this country who end up having severe brain damage because they don’t have access to this treatment,” Abella said. “It’s not subtle.”\n\nTHE BRAIN ON FIRE\n\nWhen a cardiac arrest stops the circulation, the first organ to crave oxygen is the brain. But the real trouble doesn’t begin until the heart is shocked back to life and starts flooding the brain with fresh oxygen. In a chemical wildfire of sorts, the cells crank up their activity so much it becomes toxic. Waves of electricity crisscross through the tissue, inflammation revs up, and untold numbers of brain cells switch on genetic suicide programs.\n\n“The one thing that has a beneficial effect on every single one of these processes is cooling the tissue,” said Dr. Stephan A. Mayer, an expert in cooling and a neurologist at Columbia University in New York. “Imagine a massive chemical burn injury. Cooling the tissue, hypothermia, is like throwing cold water on the whole response.”\n\nSo when Sproull was wheeled into the emergency room at Paoli Hospital, a dozen minutes from De Lage Landen, cardiologist Dr. Todd Rudo went to work quickly. He wrapped Sproull in ice bags and later blankets with cold fluid circulating through them. As is commonly done, he also gave him sedatives and muscle relaxants to make sure he wouldn’t shiver and reheat.\n\nMeanwhile, Sproull’s wife of 23 years, Debbie, was stuck in slow-moving traffic. A veteran nurse practitioner, she had been at work at Bellevue Hospital in New York when she received the bad news. She scrambled to her car, clutching a printout with directions to Paoli.\n\n“I was three hours away, in the middle of a nor’easter, trying to drive there,” she said. “Basically everybody was involved but me.”\n\nKnowing nothing of Paoli Hospital, she decided to have Ed transferred to the nationally renowned resuscitation center at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nNO EASY FIX\n\nA dark-haired, energetic man of 39 whose frequent smile makes his eyes squint, Abella has been one of the driving forces behind Penn’s cooling program, which launched in 2006. He had started another cooling program at the University of Chicago back in 2002, when the procedure was still very much experimental. That same year, two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine got the ball rolling, becoming central parts of the evidence that led the American Heart Association to recommend cooling a few years later.\n\nBoth studies were relatively small — including 77 and 275 patients, respectively — but had a strong design. For each, researchers randomly assigned resuscitated, comatose patients to cooling or normal temperature. In one study, half the cooled patients survived with good brain function, compared to only a quarter of those who weren’t cooled; in the other, funded by government grants, the numbers were 55 percent and 39 percent, respectively.\n\nThe most up-to-date analysis of randomized controlled trials — the most powerful study design — was published in 2009 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research. Based on 481 patients, it showed cooling increased the number of people with good brain function by more than half, and overall survival to hospital discharge by slightly more than one-third.\n\nPenn now cools some 40 patients a year. After introducing the procedure, the number of people who can leave the hospital without brain damage leapt from 20 percent to 45 percent — a small number in absolute terms, but 10 human lives nonetheless.\n\nLarger studies suggest one extra patient will survive without brain damage for every four to six people cooled. That could mean an additional 2,300 Americans would be able to leave the hospital with little or no brain damage every year, according to a government-funded study from 2008. Some experts say the number could be much higher.\n\nNo matter what the exact number, “That’s a lot of people going home to their families who otherwise would have died or had severe brain injury,” Abella said.\n\nBehind him, the office wall is crowded with awards, including one from a Philadelphia magazine listing him among the city’s best physicians under 40. A few years ago, he created the first national training course in cooling, which has been fully booked ever since.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean all or most hospitals have embraced the procedure, he says. There aren’t any good data, but Abella estimates about a quarter of U.S. hospitals reliably offer cooling. Others may use it erratically, depending on which doctor is attending the emergency room.\n\nAccording to a survey from 2005, the same year the American Heart Association began recommending cooling, three-quarters of U.S. physicians caring for cardiac arrest patients had never used the procedure. Beyond saving lives, there is no carrot for those who do, just as there is no stick for those who don’t.\n\n“The problem with cooling, and the reason why hospitals have been slow to adopt it, is it hits medicine in its Achilles heel — meaning it’s not a new medicine or device where you just buy it and it’s done,” Abella said. “It’s a system, it’s a protocol. It involves interaction of doctors and nurse teams from different units.”\n\nAbella’s assessment rings true with many other experts who spoke with Reuters Health. Basically, they say, every hospital needs someone who’s enthusiastic enough about cooling to take on the task of organizing the logistics and establishing a protocol. Earlier this year, a study of 14 Canadian hospitals found that apart from lack of knowledge, hospital staff pointed to collaboration between personnel and simple practical matters as big hurdles.\n\nAs one staffer responded in the study, published in the journal Critical Care Medicine: “Where is the ice machine? Are there enough bags? How is it actually going to work? Where do the bags go?…”\n\nCOOLING ON THE CHEAP\n\nMany of the physicians involved with cooling research -- including Abella and Columbia's Mayer -- also receive funding and consultant fees from companies manufacturing hypothermia equipment. Such companies include Philips Healthcare, Zoll, Medivance and Gaymar. (See sidebar here )\n\nTheir cooling machines, which look somewhat like R2-D2 from the Star Wars movies, usually cost between $20,000 and $30,000 each. They work pretty much like air conditioners, circulating cold water through blankets wrapped around the patient while monitoring the patient’s temperature with a thermometer.\n\nThe machines have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for temperature control, but not specifically in cardiac arrest. Abella, Mayer and many other physicians use them, but readily agree sophisticated equipment isn’t necessary, as long as you can get the patient cold fast and keep his or her temperature within tight bounds.\n\nAt Elmhurst Hospital, a red brick behemoth planted squarely in the middle of Queens, New York, Dr. Scott Weingart is doing exactly that. Using cold IV saline, which costs only cents, he is able to chill people in about 30 minutes. Then he wraps the naked patient in cooling blankets, which cost less than $100, hooked up to a Blanketrol cooling machine from Cincinnati Sub-Zero. The machine is about $12,000 new, but Weingart shares them with the operating room.\n\n“Money is not an issue,” said Weingart, who has no financial ties to the industry. “Any hospital that’s using money as a reason not to start (cooling) is kind of missing the boat.”\n\nElmhurst cooled more than 50 patients in 2009, placing it ahead of all other New York City hospitals. In Weingart’s experience, and according to published reports, complications from surface cooling are very rare.\n\nWhile Elmhurst doesn’t have a dedicated hypothermia team, Weingart said it took about a year to get everybody up to speed. The biggest expense was nursing time, he explained. And it matters little that cooling is not currently reimbursed by Medicare, because the nursing care should have gone in anyway. Hospitals that cite staffing needs as an excuse for not using cooling “probably weren’t taking ideal care of that cardiac arrest patient before hypothermia,” he said.\n\nWORST FEARS REALIZED\n\nEd Sproull landed on the roof of Penn Hospital’s Ravdin Building on the morning of March 31. Since 2009, Penn has flown in patients from surrounding community hospitals to get them cooled as fast as possible, and a helicopter had picked Ed up at Paoli as soon as the weather cleared up.\n\nAt Penn, doctors told Debbie Ed’s chances were excellent. He’d had a heart attack — a common trigger for cardiac arrests — but it was probably minor. She began to hope the worst was over.\n\nAs it turned out, Debbie recalled, “They were completely incorrect.”\n\nWhen Abella started the re-warming process, Ed, still unconscious, suddenly got very sick. His blood pressure plummeted, suggesting his heart was about to give in again. He was rushed to the catheterization lab, where cardiologists x-rayed his heart in a procedure known as coronary angiography.\n\n“Our worst fears were realized,” Abella recalled. Ed’s coronary arteries, which were supposed to supply his heart with blood, were clogged by thick layers of hardened cholesterol.\n\nTo survive, Ed would need open-heart surgery. It was a lot to go through under any circumstances, and nobody knew what Ed’s neurologic status was. Would he emerge from his coma after the surgery? Would he have crippling brain damage? Bluntly put, was it worth the trouble and the cost?\n\nCOOLING MEANS DOCTORS TRY HARDER - AT A COST\n\nDebbie and the doctors decided it was, and Ed ended up having triple bypass surgery. At another hospital, he might never have gotten that far.\n\n“Many, many, many times we know that practitioners will withdraw care early,” said Dr. Bentley J. Bobrow, an emergency physician and the medical director of the Arizona Department of Health Services. “And they do that based on the premise that the person won’t wake up. Well, all those historic observations of people not waking up are all prior to the era of therapeutic hypothermia.”\n\nIn 2007, Bobrow started a network of cardiac arrest centers in Arizona that now covers more than three-quarters of the state. While cooling is only one of the requirements for being part of the network, it has been a fundamental game changer, Bobrow told Reuters Health.\n\n“Therapeutic hypothermia has really changed the paradigm on withdrawal of care for cardiac arrest,” he said. “One of the major interventions, I think, is that we simply are trying harder and we’re not giving up as easily or as early.”\n\nIt is that attitude that’s driving the real cost of cooling. In fact, 99 percent of the total cost for cardiac arrest patients who are cooled is incurred by care delivered after re-warming the patient, such as inserting a defibrillator or rehabilitation, according to a 2009 study by Dr. Raina Merchant and colleagues at Penn.\n\nFor 100 patients, she found, cooling would add about $3.1 million, including training hospital staff and buying cooling, to a bill already amounting to more than $10 million for standard care.\n\nWhat would that cost the U.S. health care system every year? Not all patients are good cooling candidates. Some may have a blood pressure that’s too low, and so die quickly, and others have do-not-resuscitate orders. Abella estimates about 25,000 Americans might benefit from cooling. If Merchant’s assumptions scale up, treating those would mean spending an additional $780 million. In return, some 4,000 more people would be able to walk back to their old lives and jobs every year, at a price of slightly less than $200,000 each.\n\nCOMING BACK\n\nIt took one more day before Ed began to stir, on the morning of April 2. Debbie had stayed with him every day, except for the few hours she slept at a nearby hotel.\n\nAt first Ed was combative and confused, and he tried to yank out the breathing tube going down his throat. “He started to look at me, and he would nod, and he would try to talk to me through the tube,” Debbie recalled, “but he was totally glassed.”\n\nThe week Ed spent in the intensive care unit (ICU) was the saddest time for Debbie. He would move his lips around the breathing tube as if asking her what he was doing there, but she couldn’t bring herself to tell him the truth.\n\nWhen she finally caved in, it broke her heart. “I’ll never forget the look on his face. I mean, he started to cry, and I’ve never seen him cry — I’ve known him for 25 years.”\n\nOnce Ed was out of the ICU, he was able to sleep through the night without being interrupted every few hours by nurses and doctors checking his vital signs and adjusting his medications.\n\nOne morning Debbie walked in and saw Ed sitting up in bed.\n\n“He’s there texting away, back on the Blackberry,” she recalled. “I knew, I knew that he was back. I knew that we were going to step right back into our life.”\n\nPICKING UP SPEED\n\nDespite a broad consensus that cooling works, a lot of unanswered questions remain. Most studies, for instance, have focused on patients with ventricular fibrillation, in which the heart quivers instead of pumping out blood. It’s unknown if cooling will be equally effective if the heart is completely still when it’s jumpstarted by a defibrillator, just as it’s uncertain how much speed matters when cooling a patient.\n\nSome of the answers may become apparent over the next few years, as more and more healthcare systems begin to implement cooling. New York City, for instance, launched a citywide program in January 2009 in which all resuscitated cardiac arrest patients, with a few exceptions, are taken to a hospital that uses cooling. And this August, the city equipped its ambulances to start cooling with cold IV saline even before they reach the hospital.\n\nSo far, 46 of the New York’s 53 hospitals have joined the program, said Dr. John Freese, an EMS medical director at the New York City Fire Department. It’s still too soon to give definite numbers, he added, but “I can say without question that survival to hospital discharge has improved.”\n\nFreese said not every hospital across the country would need to use cooling. “We need to recognize that some hospitals are going to be more capable of providing top-level care for the patients,” he told Reuters Health. “We need to have some regionalization of critical care. That’s where the solution lies.”\n\nHealthcare systems nationwide already use a regionalized model to handle serious trauma, such as gunshot wounds. Earlier this year, the American Heart Association proposed a similar system for cardiac arrests.\n\nDr. Graham Nichol of the University of Washington in Seattle, who co-wrote AHA’s policy statement, said regionalization was already happening in some states. Apart from Arizona, he said Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington State were also starting to regionalize cardiac arrest care.\n\nOne of the sponsors behind these efforts is the Medtronic Foundation, the philanthropic part of Medtronic, which produces defibrillators and other medical devices. This year, the foundation launched a program to fund a multipronged approach to cardiac arrest care. It focuses on both community responses, such as having defibrillators readily available in public locations, and on emergency rescue and hospital care, including cooling.\n\n“What we are launching at this point is this whole idea of simultaneous delivery of a systems-based approach in a given state,” Joan Mellor of the Medtronic Foundation told Reuters Health. “We have a goal with our partners to increase survival by 50 percent in a given state over five years.”\n\nShe said the foundation was working with hospitals in a handful of states, including Minnesota and Washington, and was giving grants of up to about $3 million. The hope, she added, was that these local efforts would inspire other healthcare systems across the country.\n\nA NEW OLD LIFE\n\nOn a sunny evening in June, Ed, a white shirt hiding his scarred chest, recalled what it was like to come back from “the gray zone.”\n\n“When I first woke up, I didn’t remember what my own house looked like,” he said. “I sort of had to look up numbers that I used to call six times a day.”\n\nBut each visitor who came to the hospital brought old memories, and soon his old life started flooding back. “It was a little bit overwhelming.”\n\nIn early May, less than a month after he had left the hospital, he picked up his oldest son at the airport and drove him back to their house. Three days later, he went back to working as a vice president at De Lage Landen. And on June 6, he and Debbie went to celebrate their youngest son’s high school graduation.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n“It was just really the two of us and my son who really could value it,” Debbie said.\n\nEd, who is soft-spoken and jovial, said he had settled right back into his old life, except he now takes a bunch of medications and keeps clear of white bread and coffee, which his doctors tell him are less healthy for his heart than whole grain and decaf.\n\n“I used to be a coffee junkie,” he said wistfully. But soon he is chuckling, spinning a yarn about a 5-foot blue shark he and some friends once caught off the shore of Barbuda.""]","Reuters Health digs deep and wide on this one, affords the story a lot of space, and delivers readers a very good story. ","1clip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/>



 
This in-depth (3400 word) report on cooling patients after cardiac arrest in order to reduce the risk of brain damage offers readers a wealth of detail on therapeutic hypothermia, the available evidence of its effects, and some of the apparent reasons most hospitals have yet to put it into routine use. The story specifically notes the small numbers of patients that have been studied in controlled trials, as well as the fact that many patients would need to be treated in order for one additional person to recover fully. The story also makes a potent case that institutional and individual inertia and resistance to change has slowed the adoption of this technique despite recommendations from leading professional groups.
However, the only patient featured in the story is a man who fully recovered. The powerfully emotional telling of his cardiac arrest, his treatment, the strain on his family and their joy at his recovery may overwhelm the hard data indicating that while cooling does appear to offer benefits (and no greater risk of harm), the overwhelming majority of such patients will not recover despite receiving therapeutic hypothermia.

Phase 3 studies are needed before the vaccine could be approved.\n\nThe science is early, Hale stressed, and it will take at least five years before the vaccine could conceivably be available if ongoing studies bear out.\n\nHER2-positive breast cancer tests positive for a protein known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, which promotes the tumor cell growth. About one of every five breast cancers involves cancer cells that churn out an excess of HER2 due to a genetic mutation. HER2-positive breast cancers are often more aggressive than other types, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe goal of the vaccine, Hale said, is to educate the body to respond to that HER2-based peptide, so it will recognize the cancer when it recurs and attack it.\n\n""If your immune system has been educated by the vaccine to recognize the tumor cells, we think it will allow the immune system to take care of any individual [cancer] cells trying to set up shop,"" explained Dr. Elizabeth Mittendorf, a surgical oncologist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She is the principal investigator on the trial.\n\nThe study involved 217 breast cancer survivors who had gone through their treatment and were free of disease at the start of the trial. The women were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine paired with an immune stimulant, or the immune stimulant alone.\n\nThe women received monthly injections for six months. The researchers then conducted a variety of tests to gauge each woman\'s immune system response.\n\nThe investigators found that in the vaccinated group, 86 percent of patients showed a significant response, compared with 27 percent of those in the ""control"" group who did not get the injection.\n\nHow to explain the 27 percent who responded without the vaccine? ""For the controls, even without having their immune systems \'educated\' towards HER2 specifically, they may still mount a response because they have previously seen HER2 within their own cancer,"" Hale said.\n\nThose who were vaccinated also displayed a decrease in certain cells that suppress the immune system. That is a good thing, Hale said, because ""an increase in these cells has been found to be associated with [cancer] recurrence.""\n\nDon Diamond, director of translational vaccine research and a professor of virology at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., reviewed the findings and said, ""Their approach is well thought out and makes sense.""\n\nStill, the study remains very preliminary, he cautioned. ""Whether it actually has an increase in survival remains to be seen,"" he said.\n\nThat study will be done, Hale said, and they plan to follow the women for three years and look at survival differences.\n\nBut until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, Diamond said, no one can say if it helps the patients in a meaningful way.\n\nNumerous vaccines to prevent breast cancer recurrence are currently under study, he noted.\n\nFindings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about immune-based cancer therapies, visit the American Cancer Society.']","Key quote found too late in the story: “Until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, no one can say if it helps patients in a meaningful way.”","The current article discussed some very preliminary results of an experimental vaccine for HER-2 breast cancer.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The first new asthma pill in decades has produced promising results in a small clinical trial, potentially paving the way for another treatment option for patients by the end of the decade.\n\nFevipiprant, which is being developed by Novartis, reduced a biological marker of asthma nearly five-fold in the 12-week trial involving 61 patients, researchers said on Saturday. No serious adverse events were reported.\n\nLarger and longer studies are now needed to prove that the twice-daily pill can also reduce severe asthma attacks, known as exacerbations. Novartis believes the medicine could be filed for regulatory approval in around 2019.\n\nPills for asthma used to be standard treatment 40 or 50 years ago, but those older products were often associated with worrying side effects. They have since been replaced by inhalers that deliver small amounts of drugs directly into the lungs.\n\nThe Novartis pill works in a very precise way to block the action of inflammatory cells called eosinophils.\n\nThe latest research, published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine, comes at a time of considerable innovation in asthma care, with the recent launch of new injectable drugs for severe asthma that also target eosinophils.\n\nAt the same time, many drugmakers are developing improved asthma inhalers, including “smart” devices with sensors that monitor use.']","The story does an admirable job of describing how this pill fits into a climate of innovation in asthma treatment, but would have benefitted from independent perspective.","This brief story is one of two we’re reviewing this week about a clinical trial for fevipiprant, an asthma pill under development by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.

Most sleep aids, including Sanofi’s Ambien or Sunovion Pharmaceuticals’ Lunesta, act on a key neurotransmitter in the brain called GABA.\n\n“These treatments work by forcing the brain to go to sleep,” said study leader Jason Uslaner of Merck in an interview on the website of Science Translational Medicine, which published the study.\n\nGABA receptors are important to many brain regions, including those important for cognition, which is likely why common sleep aids can cause memory loss and attention problems.\n\n“When you hit those, you don’t just hit the sleep system,” John Renger, executive director and head of neruoscience basic research at Merck and one of the study’s authors, said in a telephone interview.\n\nSuvorexant is part of a class of drugs called Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists or DORAs, which work by blocking chemical messengers called orexins. Orexins are responsible for keeping people awake. Levels of this compound rise during the day and fall at night.\n\nOrexins originate in a specific region of the hypothalamus, so targeting them may have less impact on other brain functions, Renger said.\n\nFor this study, the team wanted to find out what would happen if someone is awakened on this drug and has a very high level of it in their system.\n\n“How impaired would they be?” Renger said.\n\nTo test this, the researchers did a series of experiments on rhesus monkeys and rats. First, the team trained monkeys to perform a common attention test in which they needed to respond quickly to a blinking light on a screen and remember what they touched. Monkeys given GABA inhibitors were much slower in responding to the prompt, and in some cases, missed it altogether, while monkeys given a potent orexin blocker called DORA-22 did not show these attention issues, Renger said.\n\nThe team also saw differences in a simple memory test in rats. Rats were first exposed to a colored object, and then later exposed to it again. Typically, rats that recall an object show less interest in it when they are shown it again.\n\nIn the study, rats given GABA blockers were less likely to recall the objects than those given DORA-22.\n\nEmmanuel Mignot of Stanford University, who wrote a commentary on the study in the same journal, said the findings show promise.\n\n“Are DORAs the perfect hypnotics? Only long-term use in large numbers of insomnia patients will reveal whether these drugs will be preferred to GABAergic hypnotics, and whether they produce rare complications, including narcolepsy-like symptoms in predisposed individuals,” Mignot wrote.\n\nSo far, Merck has not seen any cases of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder marked by daytime sleepiness, in its late-stage clinical trials, Renger said.\n\nThe most common side effects from Suvorexant have been headache and sleepiness. No serious drug-related side effects have been reported.']",Better sleeping pills for rats and monkeys awakened for midnight memory tests. Many questions for people with insomnia.,"This story about a new type of sleeping pill does a better job than the HealthDay story we also reviewed of alerting readers in the first 6 words that it was just an animal experiment. However, there is less independent perspective provided than in the HealthDay story. Both stories make clear that the research was done by the company seeking FDA approval for a similar drug. And like the other story, this one fails to tell readers that this experiment did not test the sort of next-day hangover effect that hits many users of currently available drugs. It is puzzling, too, that neither story asks why these side effect questions apparently were not addressed in the human studies Merck submitted to the FDA.

Winer, chief of women’s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.\n\nTamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.\n\nAbout 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.\n\nIn the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.\n\nAbout 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.\n\nThere was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n“The treatment effect is real, but it’s modest,” said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n“Over all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,” Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n“They don’t feel well on them, but it’s their safety net,” said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. “I have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.”\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. “If it can keep the cancer away, I’m all for it,” said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.\n\nCost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.\n\nPerhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would “apply to endocrine therapy in general,” meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years. Other doctors were not so sure.\n\nThe Atlas study was paid for by various organizations including the United States Army, the British government and AstraZeneca, which makes the brand-name version of tamoxifen.""]","An excellent story, addressing most major points of extended tamoxifen breast cancer treatment research while incorporating clear, clean writing.  Better than the competing ","Also longer than the competing AP and USA Today stories, coming in at more than 1,000 words – an increasingly rarer but appreciated treat in journalism these days.
The story makes a good point missing from the USA Today article – that many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis may pass through menopause by the time they finish tamoxifen or experience early menopause as a result of chemotherapy.  This is an important point in trying to weigh how beneficial the extra treatment really is for premenopausal women.

Orexin is a neuropeptide that is believed to play a key role in regulation of the brain’s sleep/wake process.\n\nThe 254-patient study tested MK-4305 at 10 milligrams, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg against a placebo. The findings were presented at Associated Professional Sleep Societies meeting in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn the one-night measure, patients who took the highest dose of the Merck drug slept 12.2 percent more of the eight hours than those who got a placebo. The improvement was 11.6 percent at 40 mg, 6.6 percent at 20 mg and 6.2 percent at the lowest dose.\n\nAfter four weeks, when there tends to be some improvement in the placebo patients, 80 mg patients slept 7.7 percent more, while those who got the 40 mg dose slept 7.9 percent more. At 20 mg the difference was 10.4 percent and at 10 mg, 4.7 percent.\n\nMerck said it has begun separate larger Phase III studies of MK-4305 in elderly and non-elderly insomnia patients and expects to seek approval of the drug in 2012.\n\nThe company said it is testing only the 40 mg and 20 mg doses in the Phase III study among younger patients and 30 mg and 15 mg doses in the late stage trial of elderly patients.\n\n“Forty milligrams looked like best dose on efficacy and tolerability,” said David Michelson, Merck’s vice president for neuroscience clinical research. He said the 80 mg dose was likely more than most people need.\n\nPeople with insomnia may have one or more sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep and difficulty getting back to sleep after waking in the night.\n\nPatients who took the 40 mg dose in the trial spent 33 fewer minutes awake after falling asleep than the placebo group at one night and averaged 32 fewer minutes awake at the end of week four.\n\nOn average, it took patients 21.6 fewer minutes to fall asleep with the 40 mg dose of MK-4305 than a placebo on night one, Merck said.\n\nThere were no reports of serious adverse side effects. The most common side effects included upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, dizziness, drowsiness on waking, headache and vivid dreams.\n\n“We are encouraged by these Phase II results showing positive effects of MK-4305 in patients with primary insomnia,” Michelson said in a statement.']","A story apparently driven by a news release – providing little context, no cost information and a confusing jumble of numbers that leaves readers with  more questions than answers.","Merck must have loved this story – getting nine mentions and getting away claims that were unchallenged by any independent source.

A team from the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology at Oxford University found that a blood test that looks for antibodies that recognize the protein tenascin-C could reliably show those who will contract the condition.\n\nWhen inflammation occurs in the body, some proteins are altered in a process called citrullination. These altered forms can prompt an immune response from the body, which can see it turning antibodies on itself - causing rheumatoid arthritis. For that reason, tests that spot antibodies to citrullinated proteins are already used to diagnose the disease. While tests for individual proteins usually have a relatively low diagnostic sensitivity, a more general test called CCP, that detects synthetic citrullinated peptides, identifies a lot more RA cases.\n\nLead researcher Dr Anja Schwenzer said: 'We knew that tenascin-C is found at high levels in the joints of people with RA. We decided to see if it could be citrullinated and, if so, whether it was a target for the autoantibodies that attack the body in RA. That might also indicate whether it could be used in tests to indicate the disease.\n\n'When we looked at results from more than 2000 patients we found that testing for antibodies that target citrullinated tenascin-C (cTNC) could diagnose RA in around 50% of cases, including some cases not identified by CCP. It also has a very low rate of false positives - it is 98% accurate at ruling out RA.'\n\nThe Kennedy Institute's Professor Kim Midwood said: 'What is particularly exciting is that when we looked at samples taken from people before their arthritis began, we could see these antibodies to cTNC up to 16 years before the disease occurred - on average the antibodies could be found seven years before the disease appeared.\n\n'This discovery therefore gives us an additional test that can be used to increase the accuracy of the CCP assay and that can predict RA, enabling us to monitor people and spot the disease early. This early detection is key because early treatment is more effective.'\n\nStephen Simpson, Research Director, for Arthritis Research UK said: 'When it comes to rheumatoid arthritis, early diagnosis is key with research showing that there is often a narrow 'window of opportunity' following the onset of symptoms for effective diagnosis and control of disease through treatment. Furthermore, current tests for rheumatoid arthritis are limited in their ability to diagnose disease in different patients. This latest research provides the basis of tests that could improve diagnosis and, importantly, detect disease at a very early stage, with the promise even that people at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis can be followed before the disease begins. This could have great potential to help patients with rheumatoid arthritis get the right treatment early to keep this painful and debilitating condition under control.'\n\n###""]",This release touts the benefits of a test that might find people destined to develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA). But it doesn’t acknowledge the potential downsides of labeling healthy people with “pre-RA.”,"This release from the University of Oxford describes a new blood test that researchers there developed after zeroing in on the protein that collects in the joints of people with rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of the protein can predict the advance of rheumatoid arthritis many years before arthritis symptoms develop, according to the research findings published in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. Among some of the 2,000 individuals who were part of the study, the protein, called tenascin-C, was found as many as 16 years before disease symptoms appeared.
The release does a good job describing the science behind the test but may leave readers wondering, “What’s next?” That’s because we aren’t told when and where the test will be available and there’s no mention of early treatment strategies — what the options are, what they entail, how long it lasts and what it might cost.

Federal regulators require companies to conduct studies proving the effectiveness of such therapies, and monitor them closely. The practice is common for smoking cessation therapies, said Robert West, director of tobacco studies at University College London, who was among the study’s authors. If such studies were funded by the government, which sustains a lot of academic research, taxpayers would bear the burden for what the company would eventually profit from, he said.\n\nStill, some researchers not involved in the study said the topic required more work.\n\n“The approach taken here is a very reasonable one that appears to have been successful,” said Gary A. Giovino, a professor of health behavior at the State University of New York at Buffalo. “But the findings from one study do not make a fact. We need more studies, funded by someone other than the company that makes the product.”\n\nSmoking is the largest cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans a year. The smoking rate has declined substantially since the 1960s, but the pace of decline has slowed in recent years and health experts are trying to figure out how to get more smokers to quit.\n\nAbout 1,500 patients at 61 clinics in the United States and abroad participated in the study. None were willing to quit immediately, but all said they wanted to smoke less and to quit for good within three months. They were randomly assigned to two groups.

Parvalbumin, a protein found in great quantities in several different fish species, has been shown to help prevent the formation of certain protein structures closely associated with Parkinson\'s disease.\n\nFish has long been considered a healthy food, linked to improved long-term cognitive health, but the reasons for this have been unclear. Omega-3 and -6, fatty acids commonly found in fish, are often assumed to be responsible, and are commonly marketed in this fashion. However, the scientific research regarding this topic has drawn mixed conclusions. Now, new research from Chalmers has shown that the protein parvalbumin, which is very common in many fish species, may be contributing to this effect.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Parkinson\'s disease is amyloid formation of a particular human protein, called alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is even sometimes referred to as the \'Parkinson\'s protein\'.\n\nWhat the Chalmers researchers have now discovered, is that parvalbumin can form amyloid structures that bind together with the alpha-synuclein protein. Parvalbumin effectively \'scavenges\' the alpha-synuclein proteins, using them for its own purposes, thus preventing them from forming their own potentially harmful amyloids later on.\n\n""Parvalbumin collects up the \'Parkinson\'s protein\' and actually prevents it from aggregating, simply by aggregating itself first,"" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, Professor and Head of the Chemical Biology division at Chalmers, and lead author on the study.\n\nWith the parvalbumin protein so highly abundant in certain fish species, increasing the amount of fish in our diet might be a simple way to fight off Parkinson\'s disease. Herring, cod, carp, and redfish, including sockeye salmon and red snapper, have particularly high levels of parvalbumin, but it is common in many other fish species too. The levels of parvalbumin can also vary greatly throughout the year.\n\n""Fish is normally a lot more nutritious at the end of the summer, because of increased metabolic activity. Levels of parvalbumin are much higher in fish after they have had a lot of sun, so it could be worthwhile increasing consumption during autumn,"" says Nathalie Scheers, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and researcher on the study. It was Nathalie who first had the inspiration to investigate parvalbumin more closely, after a previous study she did looking at biomarkers for fish consumption.\n\nOther neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\'s, ALS and Huntington\'s disease, are also caused by certain amyloid structures interfering in the brain. The team is therefore keen to research this topic further, to see if the discovery relating to Parkinson\'s disease could have implications for other neurodegenerative disorders as well. Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede stresses the importance of finding ways to combat these neurological conditions in the future:\n\n""These diseases come with age, and people are living longer and longer. There\'s going to be an explosion of these diseases in the future - and the scary part is that we currently have no cures. So we need to follow up on anything that looks promising.""\n\nA follow up study, looking at parvalbumin from another angle, is indeed planned for this autumn. Nathalie Scheers, together with Professor Ingrid Undeland, also of Chalmers, will investigate parvalbumin from herring, and its transport in human tissues.\n\n""It will be very interesting to study how parvalbumin distributes within human tissues in more depth. There could be some really exciting results.""\n\nMore About: Fish and Better Neurological Health\n\nThe link between higher consumption of fish and better long-term health for the brain has been long established. There is correlation between certain diets and decreased rates of Parkinson\'s disease - as well as other neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n""Among those who follow a Mediterranean diet, with more fish, one sees lower rates of Parkinson\'s and Alzheimer\'s,"" says Tony Werner, a PhD student in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and lead researcher on the study. This has also been observed in Japan, where seafood forms a central part of the diet. The team is careful to note that no definite links can be established at this point, however.\n\nMore About: Amyloids and Aggregation\n\nProteins are long chains of amino acids that fold into specific structures to carry out their function. But sometimes, proteins can fold incorrectly, and get tangled up with other proteins, a process known as aggregation. As these misfolded proteins aggregate together, they create long fibrous structures known as amyloids. Amyloids are not necessarily a bad thing, but can be responsible for various diseases. Some of them can interfere with neurons in the brain, killing those cells, and causing a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nMore About: The Study\n\nNathalie Scheers had looked at parvalbumin before in another context.\n\n""I was on a previous study where we looked at possible compliance markers for fish intake. Parvalbumin is a cause of fish allergies, so we knew that it passed over to the blood, and that this form of parvalbumin is specific for fish""\n\nShe joined forces with Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, and together they took the idea forward.\n\n""Because Nathalie had previously shown that parvalbumin passes into the body of the person eating fish, it made sense to study its interaction with human proteins. We already knew that they can meet in the gut, the blood, or the brain,"" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede.\n\n###']",The announcement should have made it clear that studies of fish cannot be extrapolated to humans.,"The subtitle of this news release says the Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) study “shines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better long-term neurologic health.”
But this in vitro lab study only suggests that the fish protein, parvalbumin, binds to a particular human protein called “alpha-synuclein” which has been identified as forming amyloid chains in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
The news release should have made it clear that studies of fish cannot be extrapolated to humans, and further, that no cause and effect relationship has been established between amyloid proteins and the development of any neurologic disease.

REUTERS/David Gray\n\nIn an analysis of 29 studies, they found people who got acupuncture typically reported more pain relief than those who didn’t.\n\nBut patients treated with fake or “sham” acupuncture - using retracting needles that don’t stick in the skin, for example - estimated their pain at somewhere in between the other two groups, suggesting that they also got some benefit from the procedure.\n\n“A doctor who has a patient in pain has a lot of options,” such as medications and physical or talk therapy, said lead author Andrew Vickers, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\n“This provides evidence that they would be justified in considering… acupuncture,” he told Reuters Health.\n\nAcupuncture has been controversial among doctors as a possible treatment for a range of conditions including chronic pain and fibromyalgia.\n\nSome think it has potential as an add-on or alternative to standard treatment, while others argue any acupuncture-related benefits are likely the result of hopeful patients getting treatment they strongly believe will help them.\n\nThat either means many of the three million Americans that get acupuncture every year are “wasting their time” - or others who forgo it are missing out on potential benefits, Vickers said.\n\nTo try to help sort out which is the case, he and his colleagues analyzed 29 studies they deemed to be high-quality comparisons of acupuncture, fake acupuncture and no treatment. Those trials included close to 18,000 patients in the United States and Europe with back and neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headaches or joint pain due to osteoarthritis.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, people treated with acupuncture reported a “modest” improvement in symptoms compared to those who had sham treatment, and a larger effect compared to untreated patients.\n\nThey estimated in their Archives of Internal Medicine report that about 50 percent of patients had their symptoms cut in half with acupuncture, compared to almost 43 percent of those treated with sham acupuncture and 30 percent with no acupuncture-like therapy.\n\nA typical acupuncture session runs for about $100 and is often not covered by health insurance.\n\nUSUALLY NOT THE FIRST STEP\n\n“I have a long list of chronic pain patients coming to seek acupuncture,” said Jongbae Park, head of Asian Medicine & Acupuncture Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine.\n\nIt’s usually “not their first approach to address the condition,” he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain.\n\nPark, who was not involved in the new study, said acupuncture focuses on healing the underlying tissue injury that is causing pain, rather than treating the pain itself as medications would.\n\n“I am a biased clinician,” Park told Reuters Health. But, he added, “I would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement.”\n\nVickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/MbBLbb Archives of Internal Medicine, online September 10, 2012.""]",Comparing different stories on the same topic helps to point out relative strengths and weaknesses. The Reuters story was edged out by the competing ,"While nicely written and generally on the mark with its key messages, this Reuters story could have done a better job explaining how this new study — a systematic review — differed from the dozens of reviews that preceded it and why it is newsworthy. The key difference is that the study used a more robust methodology than previous reviews, and the findings suggest that acupuncture delivered by experts was slightly more effective than a “sham” acupuncture procedure (i.e. the effects of acupuncture are more than just a placebo). As such, there is reason believe that the new study provides a stronger assessment of the benefits of acupuncture than previous studies that have reported inconsistent findings. And clinicians may see this as justification for referring more patients to acupuncture therapy.

""We still have to find better ways to educate the millions of women suffering with VVA about the symptoms, however, so that more of them know it is common, decide to discuss treatment with their healthcare professional, and seek symptom relief with appropriate treatment.""\n\nThe new results were part of a multi-center randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial for TX004HR, an investigational bio-identical 17β-estradiol applicator free vaginal softgel capsule. Previous publications have shown TX004HR to be safe and effective at alleviating symptoms of VVA. The survey, which included 731 respondents with a 96 percent response rate, sought to quantify participants\' satisfaction with the application method and overall treatment delivery system. The majority of women taking either TX004HR or placebo (85.4 - 92.1 percent) found the product easy to use.\n\nVVA is a chronic condition associated with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). VVA affects 50 to 70 percent of post-menopausal women, and is characterized by pain with sexual activity, dryness, and discomfort. Current on-the-market treatments for VVA include both over-the-counter creams and moisturizers as well as several safe and effective prescription treatments in cream, tablet, ring or oral form.\n\nPrevious survey research completed by Dr. Kingsberg and others has shown that while 32 million women may be experiencing symptomatic VVA and suffering from related impacts on sexual function, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem and overall quality of life, only 7 percent are currently using a prescription therapy to alleviate symptoms. Though they may suffer from physical and emotional pain as a result of VVA, women may not feel comfortable discussing these symptoms with a healthcare professional, may not recognize the symptoms as treatable, may not fully understand the treatment options available, or if they did receive treatment, found the current prescription treatment options inconvenient, messy, or uncomfortable to use.\n\n###\n\nFinancial disclosure: Dr. Kingsberg has served as a consultant for TherapeuticsMD, the manufacturer of TX004HR, as well as Acerus Pharmaceuticals, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Bayer Healthcare, Emotional Brain, Materna, Novo Nordisk, Nuelle, Palatin Technologies, Pfizer, Sermonix Pharmaceuticals, Shionogi Inc. and Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAbout University Hospitals\n\nFounded in 1866, University Hospitals serves the needs of over 1 million patients per year through an integrated network of 18 hospitals, more than 40 outpatient health centers and 200 physician offices in 15 counties throughout northern Ohio.

","Screenshot: TherapeuticsMD
The news release reports the results of a study examining women’s satisfaction with an applicator-free softgel used for vaginal estrogen therapy to treat post-menopausal vaginal dryness that can cause pain during sexual intercourse. The study involved 731 post-menopausal women who used a placebo softgel or one of three containing varying levels of an investigational low-dose estrogen therapy. 
The release provides good context on what post-menopausal vaginal dryness is and how often it shows up in women. But the release was weak on describing attributes that readers need to know when assessing this potential new therapy — such as cost, harms, benefits, evidence, and what makes it different from existing estrogen-based  treatments.
While the study itself pointed out the softgels’ ability to dissolve quickly as a benefit, the release omitted this but added “elegant” as an abstract, less informative, benefit. Readers would have been better served with a more concrete approach to addressing usefulness.

There are currently two options on the market for men—vasectomy or a condom.\n\nThe research pipeline is full of possibilities, though. Scientists at Columbia University Medical Center have halted sperm production and started it again in mice with no apparent side effects, using a drug that blocks receptors for vitamin A. An injectable synthetic substance, in Phase 3 clinical trials in India, sabotages sperm as they leave the testes and lasts for years.\n\nHormone gels and implants that can make men temporarily infertile are already on the market in the U.S. for other purposes. Nonhormonal methods—removing vital proteins from sperm, thwarting their ability to penetrate eggs or zapping them with ultrasound waves—are being investigated, as well.\n\n""This is the male method moment,"" says Elaine Lissner, director of the nonprofit Male Contraception Information Project, a San Francisco advocacy group. ""The future looks different from the past.""\n\nFinding a safe and effective contraceptive for men has been difficult in part for biological reasons. It would have to be strong enough to halt production of tens of millions of sperm a day, yet not harm libido or sexual function. To improve on vasectomy, it would need to be reversible and have minimal side effects, since men themselves don\'t face the possibility of pregnancy. For example, some female birth-control pills raise the risk of blood clots, but pregnancy carries 10 times that risk, says John Amory, a professor of medicine and specialist in male reproduction at the University of Washington. For a male method, he says, ""the bar is very, very high.""\n\nFunding is an obstacle too. Several drug companies, after initial interest, have pulled back from the area amid concerns about safety and marketability. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the World Health Organization fund much basic research.\n\nYet in surveys, more than 50% of men say they would be willing to use a hormonal contraceptive to relieve female partners of the burden and to exert more control. ""It\'s scary to get that phone call. Or that text message. The one every guy on earth fears,"" says Ezekiel Setne, 20, a University of Southern Indiana premed student who says he\'s had close calls with condoms. ""I would love any effective male birth-control method.""\n\nMale Contraceptives on the Horizon Of a dozen methods being studied, here are three of the most promising. Availability in the U.S. is at least several years away. RISUG (Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance) How it works: A nontoxic polymer is injected in the vas deferens, killing sperm as they pass through. Pros: Nonsurgical; works immediately; lasts 10 years or more; is said to be reversible with another injection. Cons: Requires injection in scrotum; temporary swelling may occur. Status: Undergoing Phase 3 trials in India Hormone combination How it works: Progestin blocks testosterone needed to create sperm; testosterone-replacement restores enough to maintain muscle mass and other benefits. Pros: Uses implants, injections and gels already on U.S. market; noninvasive; reversible Cons: Takes months to work; ineffective in about 10% of men; not available in pill form; may require adjustment to avoid diminished libido, hot flashes or other side effects. Status: Shown effective in many human studies; researchers are testing best delivery modes. Vitamin A How it works: Various approaches interfere with body\'s use of vitamin A, needed to make sperm. Pros: Available in pill form; reversible; nonhormonal; no side effects seen in mice Cons: Early version caused nausea in men drinking alcohol. Status: One version not tested in humans; another seeking to reduce side effects\n\nAdvocates say condoms are, of course, still critical to preventing sexually transmitted disease. ""We hear from women who say, \'I wouldn\'t trust a guy in a bar who says he\'s had that injection\',"" says Ms. Lissner. ""If he\'s a guy in a bar, he should be wearing a condom. This is for your husband or your fiancé, and you should go with him to have it done.""\n\nBig hurdles remain. Ms. Lissner formed the nonprofit Parsemus Foundation to purchase the rights outside India to RISUG (for Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance). It involves injecting a polymer, under local anesthesia, into the vas deferens, the same vessel cut in a vasectomy; the polymer stays in place for years and kills sperm as they pass by. In India, the first men to test it have had it for 20 years, with no pregnancies, except for those who have had it reversed. Reversal is possible with another injection, Ms. Lissner says.\n\nThe Indian clinical trials don\'t meet current Food and Drug Administration standards and need to be redone for the U.S. market. Ms. Lissner hopes to begin U.S. trials next year with possible approval by 2015. The Parsemus Foundation can supply initial funding, but more will be needed, probably from other nonprofits. Drug companies probably couldn\'t profit from RISUG, she says, since it is so long-lasting and would compete with female birth-control pills.\n\nSome experts are more optimistic about methods that block the vitamin A needed to produce sperm in the testes. The Columbia researchers say they need to test their drug—known as BMS-189453—for longer periods in animals before moving to human trials. Meanwhile, Dr. Amory\'s group is studying a vitamin A-blocking drug that was shown to make human males infertile nearly 50 years ago. It also makes men violently ill if they take it and then drink alcohol. University of Washington researchers are searching for another molecule targeting the same sperm-producing enzyme without the nasty side effect.\n\nScientists have repeatedly shown that giving men a combination of testosterone and progestin—the same hormone used in birth control for women—will reduce sperm count and make some 90% of men temporarily infertile. The issue has been finding ways to deliver them conveniently.\n\nMost studies have used injections every few weeks with progestin implants, usually in the upper arm. Researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California-Los Angeles are studying testosterone and progestin gels, used daily.\n\nA new drug that mimics progestin and testosterone in a single daily pill has worked in rabbits. Many experts think nonhormonal options stand a better chance with men—and with drug companies.\n\nMeanwhile, some nonprofits are expressing interest. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has family planning as one of its priorities, is hosting a conference on new contraceptive options with the NICHD in October. Diana Blithe, program coordinator at the NICHD, says given that roughly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned, ""we need to have more options for couples to be able to plan their lives.""\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story delivers a very clear summary of the challenges to finding a safe and effective approach to a male contraceptive, and a clear-eyed summary of some of the leading research candidates.</span>","We are curious about a couple of things.

Clinical trials will need to be conducted to see if the effect researchers have observed is actually due to the meningococcal B vaccine. But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea.\n\nThe last remaining drugs to cure this sexually transmitted infection are showing signs they may only have a few more years of usefulness left.\n\n“While it is still very early days, these findings represent a positive step in the search for a vaccine against this common and distressing disease that is increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment,” said Robin Gaitens, a spokeswoman for GSK, which owns the product that contains this meningitis component.\n\nWhy would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? Some biology is useful here.\n\nMeningitis is a condition — inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord — that can be triggered by some viruses and several types of bacteria.\n\nOne of the latter is Neisseria meningitidis, sometimes known as meningococcal disease. It is the only form of bacterial meningitis that triggers epidemics.\n\nDespite the fact that gonorrhea and meningitis are quite different from one another, the bacteria that cause Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are actually related.\n\nMeningococcal disease is rare but very dangerous. It can kill, and quickly. People who survive the infection can suffer permanent brain damage or may lose one or several limbs.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for The Readout Your daily guide to what’s happening in biotech. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nBecause of the severity of the consequences, health officials often mount emergency vaccination campaigns in response to outbreaks of Neisseria meningitidis.\n\nThere are vaccines for several Neisseria meningitidis strains, but designing a vaccine to protect against the B strain was a particularly difficult nut to crack. As a consequence, the vaccine component that was made to protect against B targets a different part of the bacterium, Petousis-Harris said.\n\nThat may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. Meningococcal vaccines that protect against the other strains do not seem to have the same effect.\n\n“A lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,” Petousis-Harris said. “And what’s happened with gonorrhea? Nothing. Gonorrhea carries on its merry little way.”\n\nNew Zealand had a very bad meningococcal outbreak in the early 2000s caused by the B strain. A special vaccine that only protected against that strain was made; it was used between 2004 and 2008.\n\nPetousis-Harris and her colleagues looked later to see if gonorrhea rates had changed after that meningococcal vaccination campaign. They found people who were vaccinated were 31 percent less likely to be infected with gonorrhea than those who hadn’t received the meningococcal B vaccine.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the Lancet, was funded by GSK and Auckland Uniservices, the commercialization arm of the University of Auckland.\n\nThe single-component vaccine used by New Zealand is no longer made. But the same component is one of several in the Bexsero vaccine, which was used in Quebec when the government decided to vaccinate against meningococcal B disease in a part of the province with a high relative rate of cases a few years ago.\n\nDr. Jean Longtin, head of the province’s public health laboratory, said he and some colleagues decided to look at whether the vaccination campaign was having an impact on gonorrhea rates in that area after reading about an early observation from Norway.\n\n“In Quebec we saw the exact same effect as New Zealand,” said Longtin, who said his group is still analyzing its findings. “Gonorrhea rates have been going down in the vaccine group whereas in the non-vaccine group it’s following the rest of the province.”\n\nIt is not clear how long the protection — if it’s real — will actually last. But even a few years of protection could help significantly reduce the spread of gonorrhea, experts argue.\n\n“Mathematical modeling has shown that even a vaccine of moderate efficacy and duration could have a substantial effect on the transmission and prevalence of gonorrhea, if coverage in the population is high and protection lasts during the highest risk period,” Kate Seib, of Australia’s Institute for Glycomics, wrote in a commentary that accompanied the study.""]","This industry-sponsored study received broad coverage, much of which downplayed the lack of safety and efficacy data while raising an alarm about antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea and neglecting other strategies to combat the disease.","This story reports on a New Zealand study that suggests a vaccine that protects against a strain of meningitis may also offer some protection against gonorrhea. The research, published in the Lancet, estimated that a meningitis B vaccine administered to teens and young adults during an outbreak in the early 2000s was 31 percent effective in protecting against gonorrhea.
The story does a good job of covering the science behind this surprising finding, but its optimistic assertion that the “world might be catching a break when it comes to drug-resistant gonorrhea” seems premature. Also, the potential costs and side effects were not discussed. Excluding the drawbacks plays into the marketing strategy of GlaxoSmithKline, which is pushing to increase sales of its vaccine, Bexsero.

Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can’t pick up every case.

Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.\n\nThey collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people’s symptoms.\n\nMORE: Concussion Expert: Over 90% of NFL Players Have Brain Disease\n\nIn all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries.

If men had menstrual cramps, I think we\'d have more treatment options than Midol by now. OK, enough complaining. A British company is attempting to develop a medication designed to target the specific cause of menstrual cramps. The researchers presented data from a Phase 2 clinical trial Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco.\n\nMenstrual cramps are caused by contractions of the uterus and an increase in the hormone vasopressin. The goal of the experimental medication, called VA111913, is to block this hormone. The other remedies women use for relief -- painkillers and birth control pills -- only address the symptoms of menstrual cramps, not the cause.\n\n""This is a different approach,"" said Andy Crockett, vice president of business development for Vantia Ltd., the company developing the drug. ""Right now, the current therapies for menstrual cramps are poorly tailored.""\n\nWhile half of all women experience some menstrual cramps, about 10% to 20% have a severe condition, called dysmenorrhea.

This story reports on a very experimental new drug (so experimental it doesn’t have a name yet) that is designed to block the hormone vasopressin, a hormone that causes contractions of the uterine muscles (which causes cramps and bleeding).

She used the television\'s closed-captioning feature. She read lips and paid attention to body language. Often, it meant only being able to do one thing at a time, explained the mother of three young children.\n\n\n\nNow, thanks to an implant called Esteem, Merlo can multitask. ""I can make dinner and supervise homework at the same time,"" she said. ""I don\'t have to stop and look directly at the children. I can hear what they\'re saying behind my back.""\n\n\n\nUnlike a hearing aid, which amplifies sounds, Esteem is a prosthetic inner-ear stimulator. ""When I wore a hearing aid, I turned it off when I got home because all the background noise was so agitating,"" said Merlo, 40. ""But I keep (the Esteem) on."" A controller the size of a cellphone enables her to set her Esteem to different environments, such as ""home,"" ""restaurant"" or ""school.""\n\n\n\nMerlo\'s doctor, ear surgeon Sam Marzo of Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, has performed 40 Esteem implants since he was trained by its manufacturer, Envoy Medical Corp. in St. Paul, Minn., in 2010.

(For surgeons outside Chicago, visit envoymedical.com.)\n\n\n\n""This really fills a need for adults with moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss,"" Marzo said. The condition is caused by damage to the inner ear or to nerves from the inner ear to the brain. For patients with profound hearing loss, a cochlear implant is a better option, he said.\n\n\n\n""Esteem is great for people who have used hearing aids but are not happy with them,"" Marzo said. ""Aids require a lot of upkeep and need frequent battery changes. And they amplify all the noise so it\'s hard to filter out background noise.""\n\n\n\nImplanting the Esteem is a three-hour outpatient procedure done under general anesthesia. About two months post-surgery, when internal swelling has subsided, the doctor turns on the device.\n\n\n\n""It is surgery, so there is pain at first,"" Merlo said. ""But within a few days I was comfortable. I had an incision behind my ear, but my hair covers it. Cosmetically, you can\'t see anything now.""\n\n\n\nThe implant is permanent. It contains a battery that must be replaced in about seven years.\n\n\n\nMerlo had Esteem implanted in her left ear in September.

""There are little things that I probably heard when I was younger, before my hearing loss, but I don\'t remember them,"" she said. ""Since I got the implant, they\'re new to me. Branches tapping the windows, the breathing of the horses when I ride, different instruments in my favorite songs.

Rather than prepping patients with iodine-alcohol — a common antiseptic combination in C-sections — the research indicates that chlorhexidine-alcohol is significantly more effective. The researchers argue that the evidence is strong enough to change standard skin-prep practices for C-sections.\n\nThe study appears online Feb. 4 in The New England Journal of Medicine and coincides with a presentation at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s Annual Meeting in Atlanta.\n\n“One of the biggest complications of surgery, and of C-sections in particular, is infection,” said first author Methodius G. Tuuli, MD, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology. “For a new mother who needs to care for her baby — which is stressful even when all things are equal — having an infection can really impair her ability to do that. We are very interested in clarifying the best ways to prevent these infections, reducing the burden on the patients, on their infants and on the health-care system as a whole.”\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million women in the U.S. delivered their babies by C-section in 2013, with surgical-site infections complicating 5 to 12 percent of those deliveries. The average cost of treating those cesarean-related infections in the hospital is $3,500 and may be much higher for severe infections.\n\nThe research shows that patients in the chlorhexidine-alcohol group developed significantly fewer infections than patients in the iodine-alcohol group. Those who received the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination had a 4 percent infection rate, which is nearly half that of the patients who received the iodine-alcohol combination — 7.3 percent.\n\nThe clinical trial included 1,147 patients who underwent cesarean sections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Of 572 patients randomly assigned to receive the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination, 23 developed an infection at the site of the surgery within 30 days of the procedure. Of 575 patients who randomly received the iodine-alcohol combination, 42 developed a surgical-site infection.\n\nThe investigators pointed out that all other standard procedures for reducing the risk of infection after surgery, including giving preventive antibiotics beforehand, were the same in both groups.\n\nStudies of other types of surgeries also have suggested the superiority of chlorhexidine over iodine in preventing infection. But according to Tuuli, the unique circumstances of a C-section — that bacteria come from both skin and vagina and that a woman’s immune system is altered during pregnancy — mean the results of these studies may not apply.\n\nIn addition, past trials comparing antiseptics before surgery included relatively few participants and often compared a chlorhexidine-alcohol combination with iodine alone. These studies could not determine whether the worse performance of iodine alone was due to the chlorhexidine, the alcohol or the combination.\n\nAlthough the new study was conducted at only one hospital, the researchers said the patient population was racially diverse and that more than 60 percent received public insurance. Tuuli and his colleagues also pointed out that the superiority of the chlorhexidine-alcohol combination was consistent whether the C-section was scheduled or unscheduled, whether or not the patient was obese, whether staples or sutures were used to close the wound and whether the patient had chronic medical conditions, including diabetes.\n\nHighlighting the significance of the findings, the study’s senior author, George A. Macones, MD, the Mitchell and Elaine Yanow Professor and head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said, “This study is a tremendous addition to the literature on preventing surgical-site infections after cesarean. There are few circumstances when a single study should change our practice. But based on the biological plausibility and the striking reduction in surgical-site infections with chlorhexidine, this is one of those circumstances.”\n\n###\n\nThis work was supported by a Women’s Reproductive Health Research Career Development grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant number 1K12HD063086-01; and by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.\n\nTuuli MG, Liu J, Stout MJ, Martin S, Cahill AG, Odibo AO, Colditz GA, Macones GA.

Through its affiliations with Barnes-Jewish and St. Louis Children’s hospitals, the School of Medicine is linked to BJC HealthCare.']",This news release comparing antiseptics to prevent post-cesarean section infection covers nearly all the bases. Well done.,"Women who deliver babies via cesarean section (C-section) surgery may develop infections of the incision, and this news release describes research that shows an alternative combination of skin-cleaning agents prior to surgery may prevent those infections more effectively. The randomized study, which took place at a single hospital, included more than 1,000 patients. It showed that patients prepped for surgery with chlorhexidine-alcohol had a 4% infection rate compared with 7.3% for patients prepped with iodine-alcohol.
This well-written news release meets almost all of our criteria for accuracy and includes helpful context about the price of infection care. One area of concern is the recommendation to change the standard of care based on just one study in a single hospital. While it’s a strong study, perhaps it should be replicated in an unrelated setting and be blinded as well as randomized before recommending a change in practice.
Like another release we recently reviewed on chocolate for preventing preeclampsia, this one focused on a study presented at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s annual meeting. This quality of this well-crafted release is a nice contrast to the previous one that was graded 0 stars.

The study appears in Scientific Reports.\n\nGestational diabetes occurs only in pregnancy and results when the level of blood sugar, or glucose, rises too high. Gestational diabetes increases the mother’s chances for high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy and the need for cesarean delivery, and the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes later in life. For infants, gestational diabetes increases the risk for large birth size. Unless they have a known risk factor, such as obesity, women typically are screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test approximates the average blood glucose levels over the previous 2 or 3 months, based on the amount of glucose that has accumulated on the surface of red blood cells. According to the authors, comparatively few studies have examined whether the HbA1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes, and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers analyzed records from the NICHD Fetal Growth Study, a large observational study that recruited more than 2,000 low-risk pregnant women from 12 U.S. clinical sites between 2009 and 2013. The researchers compared HbA1c test results from 107 women who later developed gestational diabetes to test results from 214 women who did not develop the condition. Most of the women had tests at four intervals during pregnancy: early (weeks 8-13), middle (weeks 16-22 and 24-29) and late (weeks 34-37).\n\nWomen who went on to develop gestational diabetes had higher HbA1c levels (an average of 5.3 percent), compared to those without gestational diabetes (an average HbA1c level of 5.1 percent). Each .1 percent increase in HbA1c above 5.1 percent in early pregnancy was associated with a 22-percent higher risk for gestational diabetes.\n\nIn middle pregnancy, HbA1c levels declined for both groups. However, HbA1c levels increased in the final third of pregnancy, which is consistent with the decrease in sensitivity to insulin that often occurs during this time period.\n\n“Our results suggest that the HbA1C test potentially could help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes early in pregnancy, when lifestyle changes may be more effective in reducing their risk,” said the study’s senior author, Cuilin Zhang, Ph.D., of the Epidemiology Branch at NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nExercise and a healthy diet may lower blood glucose levels during pregnancy. If these measures are not successful, physicians may prescribe insulin to bring blood glucose under control.\n\nThe authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.\n\nAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD): NICHD conducts and supports research in the United States and throughout the world on fetal, infant and child development; maternal, child and family health; reproductive biology and population issues; and medical rehabilitation.

For more information about NIH and its programs, visit www.nih.gov.\n\nNIH…Turning Discovery Into Health®""]",Some discussion on the cost considerations of widespread screening for gestational diabetes would have made the release stronger.,"This release accurately describes an observational study using second-hand data from another study  which found that a relatively inexpensive blood test (HbA1c or A1C for short), commonly used to monitor diabetes, might help identify women at risk for getting gestational diabetes as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. The release does a good job of explaining that the disorder carries risks — including the development of adult type 2 diabetes long after birth — for both pregnant women and their newborns.
The release notes that the study does not scientifically demonstrate that measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy can in fact determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. On the down side, the release doesn’t mention what it would cost in dollars or potential over treatment to screen every women in the early weeks of pregnancy;  offers no information about the overall prevalence and incidence of gestational diabetes or any details about the women whose records were studied; and waits until the last sentence to note that there also is no firm evidence that lowering HbA1c levels with diet and exercise before or in early pregnancy will actually reduce risk for gestational diabetes.

But after treatment, the group exposed to the bright light was scoring sexual satisfaction scores of around 6.3. In contrast, the control group only showed an average score of around 2.7 after treatment.”']",Reuters joined the media frenzy and reported on a small study that was bound to trigger an avalanche of coverage.,"This story reports on a pilot study that used light boxes, similar to those for treating seasonal affective disorder, to increase flagging sex drive in men.

Overall, the story was too brief to be helpful and as many stories of “new findings” do, shared only positive conclusions.

If the results can be confirmed, the approach could provide another tool to fight what can be a severely debilitating disorder.\n\n\n\nMigraines, which are characterized by severe pain accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light, affect an estimated 28 million Americans. Many drugs are used prophylactically to ward off the attacks, and a relatively new family of drugs called triptans has proved very successful in curing headaches once they begin. Nevertheless, about 14% of those with migraines are unable to control the problem with existing drugs and are desperately seeking other alternatives.\n\n\n\nOne such approach is an electrostimulation device developed by Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis. Thin leads are placed under the skin near the occipital nerves, which originate in the spinal cord and branch out across the back of the brain. The leads are connected to an implanted neurostimulator that delivers controlled electrical pulses to the nerves.\n\n\n\nDr. Joel R. Saper of the Michigan Head-Pain and Neurological Institute in Ann Arbor and his colleagues enrolled 67 patients in a study funded by Medtronic. All suffered from 15 or more days of headaches per month and received no relief from conventional drugs. Thirty-three of them received the Medtronic device, 17 received a sham device and the rest received conventional medical care.\n\n\n\nSaper and his colleagues reported in the headache journal Cephalalgia that 39% of patients who received the real device had at least a 50% decrease in the number of headache days per month or a significant decrease in pain intensity during the three months of the study. The most common side effect was migration of the leads, which did not cause any long-term complications.\n\n\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the report, Dr. Todd J. Schwedt of the Washington University Headache Center in St. Louis called the results ""promising,"" but noted that the success rate of only 39% indicates that more treatments are needed. Because many people suffer migraines primarily in the front of their heads, he added, treatment might be more successful if nerves there were also stimulated.\n\n\n\n-- Thomas H.

There were 228 such hospitalizations for Januvia and 229 in the placebo group, according to data also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n“We can be reassured we can use this drug for glucose lowering without affecting the already high cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes,” said Professor Rury Holman, the study’s lead investigator, who presented the data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Boston.\n\n“For the heart failure concern raised by other agents in the class there is no difference (with placebo),” he added.\n\nThere was also no significant difference between Januvia and placebo in infections, cancer, kidney failure or severe hypoglycemia, which is dangerously low blood sugar, researchers reported.\n\nAcute pancreatitis, a concern with some diabetes drugs, was uncommon but higher with Januvia, 23 versus 12. That was not statistically significant.\n\n“Numerically this is hardly a major risk, just something we need to keep an eye on,” Holman said.\n\nPancreatic cancers, also uncommon, were numerically fewer with Januvia, 9 versus 14.\n\nDeath from any cause occurred in 7.5 percent of Januvia patients versus 7.3 percent for placebo.\n\nThe Tecos heart safety study was conducted by an independent academic research collaboration between the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit and the Duke University Clinical Research Institute. It was undertaken after heart safety concerns were raised over other diabetes medicines.']","This story missed the mark on explaining the benefits, the costs, and the conflicts of interest when covering a study about a diabetes drug.","While this story is in some respects exemplary in its coverage of a study on Januvia, a blockbuster diabetes drug, we think it missed the big picture. A full explanation of this research would have required a little more space and a lot more context than this story provided. To know whether Januvia is worth the potential risks associated with taking it, the story would have had to provide more information on the relative benefits of the drug versus other therapies, the costs of the drug in comparison to other therapies, and a more thorough analysis of the quality of the evidence in the study and perhaps other studies related to the drug. The story provides none of this information. It does provide a fairly good discussion of the risks associated with the drug — at least according to this study — but without that additional information, those risk comparisons are at best of little use and at worst highly misleading.

In 2013 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 230,000 were given that diagnosis. Each one very likely came as a devastating blow, both to the patient and to her family.\n\nBut what if some of these cases are preventable? What if there was a medication that could at least reduce a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer?\n\nSuch drugs already exist.\n\nThe Breast Cancer Prevention Trial published results in 1998 indicating that women who took one of those drugs, tamoxifen, were half as likely to develop breast cancer as similar women who did not take the drug.\n\nOther medications, including raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatese inhibitors, do much the same thing, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved aromatese inhibitors for this use. Studies estimate that more than 2 million American women at high risk for breast cancer could benefit from taking a preventive drug.\n\nA carton and individual 20 mg tablets of Tamoxifen, manufactured by Pharmaceutical company Wockhardt UK Ltd. (iStock)\n\nBut few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. A 2010 study found “exceptionally low” rates of usage.\n\nIn part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. A small 2014 study in the Journal of Women’s Health found that only 13 percent of internal medicine, family medicine and gynecology physicians reported having recommended or prescribed these medications to women who might benefit from them.\n\nThe “low uptake of these medications is a missed opportunity,” says Heidi Nelson, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. “Many high-risk women . . . could reduce their risks for invasive cancer by approximately 30 to 50 percent.” On the other hand, these drugs don’t suit everyone, and they are not without risks of their own. Because some of the side effects are serious — such as blood clots in the legs and in the lungs, and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer — only women who are deemed to be at high risk for the disease should consider them. But there are conflicting views on who meets that “high risk” definition\n\nA bit about the drugs\n\nChemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. Although both involve taking drugs, chemoprevention medications are taken with the goal of avoiding breast cancer altogether and the subsequent need for chemotherapy later.\n\nAnd they work on the body differently. Chemotherapy kills off cells, healthy ones as well as cancercous ones. The chemoprevention drugs, by contrast, work by blocking estrogen, a hormone known to promote the growth of cancer cells in breast tissue. Chemoprevention drugs are called SERMs, or selective estrogen receptor modulators, and two have been approved specifically for breast cancer prevention: tamoxifen, which was developed to treat breast cancer after its onset and only later was found to have a preventive benefit, and raloxifene, which was designed to treat osteoporosis.\n\nA 2013 study in the Lancet analyzed data for more than 80,000 women taking tamoxifen or other SERM drugs. The researchers found an overall 38 percent reduction in new cases of breast cancer 10 years after women took these drugs compared with women who took a placebo. The effect was even larger during the first five years of the study.\n\nInvestigators working for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of scientists and clinicians funded by the government, echoed these results. After looking at multiple trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene, the task force noted that these drugs reduced new cases of breast cancer significantly: from 23 cases per 1,000 women in the control groups to 16 cases per 1,000 women in the treatment groups.\n\nNelson, one of the lead authors of the analysis, is “confident” that these results show a true benefit. Others are more cautious.\n\nKenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University who worked on developing the task force’s SERM guidelines, notes that while SERMs may have reduced new cases, they “have not been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in any study or meta-analysis.” One possible explanation, he says, is that “these drugs are effective at preventing nonlethal cancers rather than the more serious ones.”\n\nNot used enough?\n\nGiven that these drugs seem to offer some protection, why are they not in widespread use? Serious side effects is one reason. Beyond blood clots and uterine cancer, other known reactions to the drugs include strokes, cataracts, bone pain, hot flashes, nausea and vaginal dryness.\n\nFor some women, the risk of such side effects may be worth taking, depending on their particular odds of developing breast cancer. Those odds can be figured by using a commonly used calculator, often called the Gail model, that estimates a woman’s chances of having breast cancer in a five-year period and over a lifetime.\n\nBut this is where it gets more complicated. While many experts agree that women at high risk should consider the medications, they do not agree on what Gail score should trigger that consideration.\n\nThe studies that served as the basis for the FDA approval of the drugs, along with recently released guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), set the threshold at a five-year Gail score of 1.67 percent.\n\nThe Preventive Services Task Force, however, recommended a threshold of 3 percent. At that point, the panel said, women “are likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene.”\n\nASCO’s lower cutoff worries some experts. “At the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,” Georgetown’s Lin says, “every woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.” That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects.\n\nStarting a conversation\n\nKala Visvanathan, the lead author of the ASCO recommendations and a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the cutoffs provide only a rough estimate of risk.\n\nIt is important to realize, she adds, that “as the risk increases, the benefits tend to be greater. This is an evolving field, and our goal is to better discern who is at high and low risk of breast cancer and develop a greater range of prevention strategies.”\n\nAn individual risk analysis should prompt conversation between doctor and patient about the potential benefits and the risk of the therapy.\n\nBoth the ASCO and the task force guidelines recommend such a conversation. “The discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent,” according to ASCO.\n\nThe task force similarly recommends that “clinicians engage in a shared, informed decision making” with women and said that clinicians “should offer to prescribe” these drugs. Many risk factors increase a woman’s chances of having side effects. These factors include older age, obesity, having a history of a blood clot, history of any cancer, immobility, history of certain autoimmune conditions, history of using estrogen or oral contraceptives and history of some form of heart disease.\n\nInsured women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs, because this treatment was included in the Affordable Care Act as mandated, no-charge preventive care.\n\nSo what should a woman do?\n\nMost important, become familiar with your family history, know your risk factors and discuss them with your primary-care physician. Age and family history cannot be controlled, but lifestyle changes — including eating a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and not overconsuming alcohol — are eminently doable and can reduce your risk. These basic tenets of leading a healthy lifestyle have been shown to be important factors in breast cancer prevention.\n\nVisvanathan and her colleagues are hopeful that more women will be aware of this option.\n\n“A discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,” she says. “We should begin to implement preventive strategies based on what we already know.”\n\nMishori is an associate professor of family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and director of the Health & Media fellowship. Seliby is a family physician and the Health & Media fellow at Georgetown University School of Medicine.']",This is a thorough look at the pros and cons of taking certain drugs that have been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer. The five stars are well deserved.,"Drugs exist to lower the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women, but they aren’t getting used as often as one might expect. This story does an excellent job of exploring the disparity between research showing the drugs’ effectiveness and the lack of real-world use. We especially like that the story includes the perspective of an independent family physician, who raises some concerns about the drugs and their supporting evidence that cancer specialists might be less likely to emphasize.
The story does have some problems that would have been fairly easy to address. Inflated relative risk figures are presented high up in the story, while more useful absolute figures are buried further down. Costs aren’t fully explored. And since the story emphasizes the need for careful patient decision-making about this treatment, we also thought it would have been valuable to interview some actual patients. With existing groups of women who “meet” on social media to discuss breast cancer, it wouldn’t have been much additional work to include the patient perspective.

""This is a very exciting advance.""\n\nThe test, from Genomic Health, aims to help the more than 45,000 American women a year diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. While some doctors consider the tumors to be very early breast cancers, other experts regard them as precancers. Although these tumors are confined to the milk ducts, they have the potential to invade the rest of the breast.\n\nUntil now, however, doctors haven\'t had a good way to tell which cases of DCIS are the most likely to spread, Solin says. Women with the condition often are treated as if they have a more advanced cancer, with lumpectomy and radiation, and sometimes years of hormonal therapies. In the case of DCIS, radiation reduces the risk of developing another tumor in the same breast, but doesn\'t improve survival, says Steve Shak, Genomic Health\'s chief medical officer.\n\nAnd while radiation is generally safe, it can burn the skin and damage the underlying heart and lung tissue, Shak says. Going to radiation treatments also is time-consuming, requiring daily visits for five to seven weeks, Solin says.\n\nThe study shows that about 75% of women fall into the ""low-risk"" category, according to their gene profiles. After 10 years, only 5% of these women developed an invasive cancer — a more serious type that had advanced beyond the milk ducts — in the same breast.\n\nYet 11% of women fell into the ""high-risk"" group. About 19% of these women developed an invasive breast cancer within 10 years.\n\nWomen and their doctors may want to use this information to guide their treatment, Shak says. A similar test for women with early-stage invasive breast cancer has been available since 2004. That test, Oncotype DX, helps predict which patients may be able to skip chemotherapy, contributing to a 20% drop in chemo use, Shak says. Genomic Health plans to make the DCIS test available by the end of the year. Although the gene test isn\'t cheap — its current cost is $4,175 — it could still save money, he says. Radiation therapy can cost more than $21,000.\n\n""For women who really don\'t want radiation therapy or a mastectomy, this might well be a way to determine whether they \'should take the risk,\' "" says surgeon Susan Love, president of the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation. ""It is the first step to being able to figure out which DCIS is important and which is not.""\n\nSome cancer specialists aren\'t ready to change their practice, however. Eric Winer of Boston\'s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who wasn\'t involved in the new study, says he\'d like to see additional studies before using the test to advise patients.\n\n""It makes everyone more comfortable to sit with the data for a little while to understand it, rather than rush out and start using it,"" Winer says. ""People will need to think it through.""\n\nJackie Fox, who was diagnosed with DCIS three years ago, says she welcomes tests that can help women make difficult decisions. Fox, 55, of Omaha, initially hoped to have a lumpectomy and radiation. After the smaller surgeries were unable to completely remove her cancer, however, she agreed to a mastectomy. ""It just seemed so drastic to me, for something that I was told was not life-threatening,"" Fox says. ""If we could reach the point where women didn\'t have to wonder anymore, where they didn\'t have to second-guess, that would be wonderful.""']","This story on a new version of a gene test meant to help women with small breast tumors make treatment decisions provides good context, but it may have obscured a key limitation of the study.","Women diagnosed with small breast tumors known as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) often have to make treatment decisions (including whether to add radiation therapy after surgery) without being certain about how much risk of a recurrence they really face. This story reports the results of a study that compared the genetic profile of tumors to the long-term cancer recurrence rate in a group of women. The story provides multiple views and useful context. However, most readers would likely assume that treatment decisions that incorporate these test results would offer better health outcomes. This story should have clearly stated that this study was not designed to answer that important question and that follow-up trials will be need to document the health effects of using this test.

The United States recommends that men and women over age 31 eat 420 and 320 milligrams of magnesium daily, respectively.\n\nMost of the studies allowed the researchers to rule out other factors, such as family history.\n\nBut Larsson told Reuters Health in an email that she could not say whether other aspects of what the people ate partially or entirely explained the finding.\n\nMore in-depth studies are needed before researchers can say that the magnesium was what actually reduced the stroke risk, she added.\n\nOther experts said the results were consistent with dietary recommendations.\n\n“It’s a diet that’s rich in fruits, vegetables and grains. Those are things that have low sodium, high potassium and high magnesium,” said Larry Goldstein, director of the stroke center at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n""It\'s again the diet per se, not any one individual component of the diet.""

Someday, they will not be able to walk. They will not be able to stand. Eventually, they will not be able to live. The brothers, ages 6 through 11, suffer from a debilitating and deadly genetic condition called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\n\nYet on September 28, Max, Rowan and Charlie Vertin got dressed up. In dark suits and blue shirts, with serious expressions on their round faces, they walked to stand next to their mother in a very beige room outside Washington, D.C. The people in that room, they believed, could change the course of their lives.\n\nFor years, the Vertin brothers have been participating in a clinical trial for a new medication called ataluren, intended to keep the progression of their disease at bay. By October 24, they’ll know if they will be able to keep taking that drug. That is the deadline for the Food and Drug Administration to make a choice. The agency could approve the drug, allowing the brothers and others like them to continue to take it. Or it could reject the drug for the third time and throw them into an uncertain future.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nAn FDA committee has already voted that data about the drug’s effectiveness was inconclusive. The agency’s final decision almost always echos the decisions of its committees. So, if this were any other kind of drug at any other time in FDA history, the FDA’s final answer would be a very predictable no.\n\nIf they do say no, the Vertins could lose access to the drug that has stabilized their condition. But there’s still a chance the FDA could approve the drug. Input from people affected by DMD may have convinced the agency once before to approve a drug for the condition despite iffy data. That is what the Vertins—and the company that produces the drug—are hoping will happen again.\n\nCourtesy of Betty Vertin\n\nFalling Behind\n\n“It started out so innocent,” his mother, Betty Vertin, told Newsweek. Max was a big infant, born 10 lbs, 3 oz and nearly two feet long. “When he was missing milestones, I just thought it was because it was a big baby.” Even doctors assumed that he would eventually catch up. But when he started preschool, the difference between Max and other children became more obvious. “When other kids were running and jumping and climbing, Max wasn’t doing those things. He was just behind, physically.”\n\nWhen Max was 4, in 2010, a genetic test confirmed that he had DMD. Betty had never heard of it. “Before we started living this life, I was clueless,” she said.\n\nDMD is one of a class of similar genetic disorders. About 15 boys out of every 100,000 in the United States under 24 years old have DMD or a milder form, called Becker muscular dystrophy. (Most of the children affected are boys.) The illness affects the way their legs, heart, and lungs work.\n\nMax’s diagnosis was devastating for Betty. “I feel like I walked into the room with a healthy four-year-old boy and I walked out with a child that was dying,” she said.\n\nBut the family’s struggles with DMD were just beginning. At the time, Rowan was 2, and Betty suspected that he also had the disease; she’d seen how her son struggled to stand up onto a stepstool in the bathroom to brush his teeth. She was also ten weeks pregnant with Charlie.\n\nGenetic tests eventually confirmed both Rowan and Charlie also had DMD. Betty’s two daughters, Lexi, 16, and Mary, 2, as well as a fourth son, Chance, 10, do not.\n\n“I felt like we had a year and a half of the same horrible diagnosis over and over and over again,” she said. “It was the hardest 18 months I’ve ever had and I hope I ever had.”\n\nCourtesy of Betty Vertin via Facebook\n\nStill Walking\n\nDMD always results in muscle weakness due to a lack of a protein called dystrophin. Some of the newest treatments for the condition try to fix that. One drug, which the FDA approved in 2016, works for people whose illness springs from a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin.\n\nThe drug, called Exondys 51 or eteplirsen, allows the genetic machinery that produces the protein to skip over the mutated part to make something that will work better. About 13 percent of people with DMD have this particular mutation, according to the FDA.\n\nThe Vertin brothers are not among them; the drug shouldn’t help them at all. So they tried ataluren. (The drug’s brand name is Translarna.) The company that produces ataluren, PTC Therapeutics, says that its drug forces cells to make the proteins in spite of a different kind of mutation called a nonsense mutation. Instead of having an error in the protein, the protein is accidentally cut short. This is the kind of mutation that three of Betty Vertin’s children have.\n\nThe Vertins have received the drug free through the clinical trial, and expenses for their trip from Nebraska to Washington, D.C. were paid by PTC Therapeutics.\n\nAtaluren works by ordering a cell to use a slightly different piece to build the protein—as if someone spray-painted the word “don’t” on the molecular version of a stop sign. Exactly how it does that is still mysterious. A paper published by the company’s scientists in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science said it probably affected the ribosome, a key part of how proteins are put together in a cell. (Researchers not affiliated with the company did not find the same kind of activity.)\n\nRegardless of what mutation causes the illness, most people with DMD die in their 20s. Betty was told to expect her oldest son, Max, to be in a wheelchair full-time by the time he was 9 or 12.\n\nMax is 11 now. His 12th birthday is in early November. He uses an electric mobility scooter for long distances, but he can still walk. He rides a bike without training wheels and without any modifications. He has a part in a school play and goes up and down stairs to get to the stage. He even plays a trumpet in his school’s band. “He’s got the lung capacity to blow that thing, very loudly,” Betty said.\n\nFor that, Betty credits ataluren, which Max started three years ago.\n\n“His life is—it’s not like his peers, but he’s getting a lot of the experiences that his peers are having,” she said. “He’s living a sort of a typical sixth-grade life and that diagnosis—I didn’t know what it would look like for him. I didn’t expect it to look like this.”\n\nCourtesy of Betty Vertin\n\nBut not everyone considers ataluren to be a miracle drug—with good reason. The clinical trial results haven\'t been great. Most of the company’s studies tested how fast a child could go about 30 feet or walk up and down stairs, or how far they could walk in six minutes. They did see some slight positive results, many of which came from a study done with the specific kind of patient the company discovered benefited most in a previous trial.\n\nThe FDA needs good data to make their decision, because when the agency approves a drug is sends a signal to the world. An approval is the FDA saying, “this drug is safe and effective. You could use it for your child, too.”\n\nPTC Therapeutics has tried to get FDA approval for the drug twice before. Both times the agency refused to even consider the application. This time, the application for approval was filed over the FDA’s protest. (The drug has been conditionally approved in Europe.)\n\nA Million Dollar Issue\n\nPart of the reason that the drug has struggled is because of this requirement: if the drug is effective, the data should show it. But that hasn\'t happened consistently with ataluren. Many of the clinical trials failed to satisfy the statistical requirement to prove a drug works—at least not for the main outcome the company was looking at. Other, secondary measurements did seem to have good statistics. Certain groups of children seemed to have better results than others, too.\n\nPTC Therapeutics founder and CEO Stuart Peltz says the statistics aren\'t a reason to reject the drug. Just because a drug doesn’t measure up in that way, he says, “doesn’t mean the drug is not effective.”\n\nBut even if the FDA agrees to overlook some of the negative data about ataluren, insurers may not. That could be a million-dollar issue for the families with affected children.\n\n“If the evidence isn’t good, then insurance companies won’t pay for [drugs],” said National Center for Health Research (NCHR) president Diana Zuckerman. Two recently approved drugs have run into this problem: Spinraza, a drug for spinal muscular atrophy, and Exondys 51. Both drugs cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Pharmaceutical companies traditionally will not discuss prices before drugs are approved; that said, ataluren costs about £220,000 in Britain. During clinical trials, participants like the Vertins normally do not pay for the treatment.\n\nThe NCHR also presented at the FDA meeting in September to discuss ataluren, urging the agency to not approve the drug without more research. The organization’s statement also raised concerns about side effects associated with the drug, specifically about the chance that it raises blood pressure and cholesterol levels in children. The company says these shifts are small and ""not clinically significant.""\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, FDA spokesperson Sandy Walsh confirmed that the FDA’s decisions are all “based on an assessment of the available data and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.” That data can include the experience of patients like Max, Rowan and Charlie.\n\nCourtesy of Betty Vertin via Facebook\n\nTo Betty, the benefits are clear, even if they aren’t easily quantified. Rowan’s gait seems better. Max still doesn’t need to use a wheelchair all the time, bucking the prediction she heard when he was first diagnosed.\n\nHowever, financial analysts who track the biotech sector are not optimistic about ataluren’s immediate prospects. Matthew Eckler, a senior biotechnology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that analysts and investors are betting the FDA will not approve the drug.\n\nThe FDA hasn’t said no yet. The agency still has nearly two more weeks to make a decision. Until then, Betty and her sons are living with a lot of uncertainty. “I’m really scared that my boys will have to go off [ataluren],” she said. Will they have access to the drug if it’s rejected? Would their conditions deteriorate if they didn’t? What other options do they have?\n\nBetty has no good answers. She is hoping she won’t need to come up with them.\n\n“DMD is a progressive disease, and my boys are stable,” Vertin said. “If we can just have a few more years with our boys or buy some time until there is a cure out there, that’s huge.”\n\nSaveSave']","Given the vividness of anecdotal accounts, the research details in a story like this must be a dominant and detailed part of the story.","This story focuses on a family tragedy—three young boys in a single family with a fatal genetic disorder called Duchenne muscular dystrophy—and the family’s hope that an experimental drug, which the three boys have been taking as part of a clinical trial, will receive FDA approval later this month.
The story is filled with emotional freight, pitting anecdotal evidence (the mother’s reflection on her sons’ vigor, which she attributes to the drug) against systematic evidence that that finds little in the way of robust benefits. While such a story offers readers a compelling look at the sometimes anguished process of clinical research in the face of a lethal disease, it gives too short shrift to the clinical research evidence available here.

The subjects in both groups took weekly 75-minute classes and practiced yoga or deep stretching at home for about 20 minutes at a time at least three days a week.\n\nThe study is the largest and most thorough to date to look at whether yoga has an effect on chronic low back pain, a problem that affects millions and has no surefire long-term remedy. A number of earlier studies suggested that regular yoga classes might benefit back pain sufferers, though most were limited by small sample sizes, short study periods and other flaws.\n\nThe latest study, published in The Archives of Internal Medicine, involved more than 200 people who were followed for up to 26 weeks.\n\n“This is good news for yoga,” said Karen J. Sherman, lead author of the study and senior scientific investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. “The smaller studies which hinted that yoga might be helpful all had problems one way or another. This is a much larger study, and the findings are robust.”\n\nAbout four out of five people experience low back pain at some point in their lives, prompting Americans to spend $50 billion a year on medications, physical therapy and related costs. Exercise, and in particular strength-training routines that develop muscles of the trunk and core, can help reduce pain and improve function, though many people avoid them for fear of doing further harm.\n\nTo find out whether the movements and static poses associated with yoga could make a difference, as earlier research had suggested, Dr. Sherman and her colleagues recruited 228 people with chronic low back pain in the Seattle area. Their mean age was in the late 40s to 50, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups. One group took weekly yoga classes over 12 weeks, which typically included breathing exercises, 5 to 11 postures and guided deep relaxation. Another group went to weekly stretching classes built around aerobic exercises, deep stretches and strengthening exercises focused on the trunk and leg muscles. Both groups were given handouts and instructional CDs and DVDs and asked to practice 20 minutes at home on days when there was no class. Those in the third group served as “self-care” controls and received a book containing advice on back exercises and ways to reduce pain.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, those in the yoga group were, over all, significantly less bothered by symptoms than the control group, and they reported better function and less difficulty in mundane daily activities like walking up stairs and bending down to put on socks. The improvements remained when the researchers checked with them 26 weeks after the start of the study. Those in the stretching group saw just as much benefit as the people taking yoga. More than half of the subjects in each group improved on measurements of function by at least 50 percent, compared with less than a quarter of the controls.\n\n“Compared with self-care, yoga and stretching class participants were significantly more likely to rate their back pain as better, much better or completely gone at all follow-up times,” the study noted. “More participants in the yoga and stretching groups were very satisfied with their overall care for back pain.”\n\nDr. Sherman said that like many other therapies for low back pain, yoga probably would not work for everyone. For those who want to try, a weekly class and a few 20-minute sessions at home might be a good starting point, she said.\n\n“Does everybody need to practice at least 20 minutes a day three times a week? It probably depends on your back pain,” she said. “At a certain point in time you learn what your back needs.”\n\nAs an alternative to yoga, stretching may be a viable option. Dr. Sherman recommended taking an intensive stretching class, then establishing a routine at home. But she cautioned that her study looked specifically at deep stretching that is far more involved than the brief, light stretches most people do before or after a workout.\n\n“It’s not like stretching each leg for 30 seconds,” she said. “It’s much more intensive. You might spend two minutes stretching each leg before moving on and stretching other parts of the body, so you’re really getting in there.”']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Journalists tread on risky ground when they summarize the results of a new study and then neglect to provide ANY independent commentary.</span>","An independent expert can point out whether a study is valid and relevant and whether any cautionary notes should accompany its conclusions.




The article provided an accurate, bare-bones description of the study and its main conclusions—that yoga and intensive stretching were similarly effective and were both superior to the self-care intervention.
But it also missed several key points, as detailed in the scoring below. And since the study in the Archives of Internal Medicine was actually accompanied by an independent commentary that could have been cited, these omissions are all the more telling.
So what points might an independent expert have added to the coverage?The most important one is that the subjects in this study were relatively affluent and generally had mild back pain and modest functional limitations. The results of this study may not apply to the large body of patients from less affluent backgrounds with more severe back pain, greater functional impairment, and more complex health problems.
Would a roughneck on an oil rig, an auto mechanic, or a hotel maid gain a similar benefit from yoga or intensive stretching as the subjects in this study? No one really knows.
The availability of these treatments is also an issue. Similarly structured viniyoga programs may not be available in many communities—and it is not clear that most health insurance plans will cover them. The type of intensive stretching program described in this study would appear to be uncommon in the United States. So most patients wouldn’t have access to this intervention.
Lastly, this study did not compare yoga and intensive stretching to “usual care”. So yoga and intensive stretching may be superior to a self-care program, but it is not as clear that they are any better than routine back care as dispensed across the United States.

WOULD YOUR BONES PASS THE BMD TEST? Those initials stand for bone mineral density. The lower your BMD, the more likely you are to break bones, especially in old age. To screen for osteoporosis (low bone mineral density), doctors usually use a DXA, or dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, machine. It scans your hip, spine or forearm with a very low dose of radiation. The tests are recommended for people who have a high risk for bone loss, including women over 65. Routine use in men is under debate, although it is recommended by some groups. For more information, visit nof.org. HEALTH COLUMNIST TWEETS HEALTH COLUMNIST TWEETS HAVE A HEALTH OR MEDICAL QUESTION? HAVE A HEALTH OR MEDICAL QUESTION? E-mail kpainter@usatoday.com. Please include your name, city and daytime phone number. Selected questions will be answered in the paper and online. Asked to name a health problem that affects one in five men, few people might think of osteoporosis. That\'s because the bone-loss disorder strikes many more women, one in two over a lifetime. Women, on average, have smaller skeletons. As they age, they lose bone mass earlier and faster. ""It\'s always been viewed as a disease of women,"" says Amir Qaseem, a physician who directs a research and education program at the American College of Physicians in Philadelphia. ""But it\'s a very important public health issue for men, too. It\'s under-diagnosed and undertreated."" But exactly how to find and help men whose bones are thinning — which increases their risk for broken hips and other fractures — is controversial for one reason: Men\'s bones aren\'t studied much. This month, that lack of research led an influential group to pass up a chance to recommend osteoporosis screening for men. In a draft statement, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said, ""Surrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harm"" of asking millions of men to take bone measurement tests — and asking the health care system to invest in more bone-scanning machines and bone-building drugs for those men. The group did update its recommendations for women, saying all women over 65 and certain younger women should be screened. (The draft recommendations are open to public comment until Aug. 3 at ahrq.gov/clinic/draftix.htm). Help that\'s too little, too late But men should take note: Qaseem\'s group and the National Osteoporosis Foundation have looked at the same sparse research and decided to recommend bone scans for men at high risk, including those older than 65 or 70. The scans do detect bone loss in men. What\'s not known is whether prescribing drugs and other treatments to men with low scores will stop them from breaking bones. But data do point in that direction, says foundation president Robert Recker . Right now, men often get too little help, too late, he says. Recker, a physician at Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, says he sees too many men like the fiftysomething laborer who came to his office recently after many months of severe back pain. He had undiagnosed osteoporosis. Six percent of all men over 50 are destined to break a hip, says the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. And studies show that when they do, they are more likely than women to die or require long-term care. That may be because the men are in worse health to begin with, says Eric Orwoll, a bone-health specialist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. In any case, he says, men should know that if they break any bone after age 50, they are at high risk for breaking another and should be evaluated for osteoporosis. Other risk factors include: • Low body weight. Thin men, just like thin women, are at higher risk. • A family history of osteoporosis. • Smoking, heavy drinking and diets low in calcium and vitamin D. • Certain medications, including glucocorticoids. • Certain conditions, including low testosterone.

news_reviews_00526,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/news-release-review/concussions-kids-detectable-blood-test/,2015-11-29 05:00:00,Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test ,"['Orlando, Fla - Researchers at Orlando Health have developed a blood test that can detect even the most subtle signs of a concussion in children, correctly identifying the presence of traumatic brain injuries 94 percent of the time in a recent study.\n\n""This could ultimately change the way we diagnose concussions, not only in children, but in anyone who sustains a head injury,"" said Linda Papa, MD, MSC, an emergency medicine physician and NIH funded researcher at Orlando Health and lead author of the study. ""We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there\'s never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. We think this test could change that,"" she said.\n\nIn a new study published in the journal Academic Emergency Medicine, Papa and her team recently performed CT scans on 152 children and compared the results of those scans with results from the blood test she developed. As expected, the high definition imagery from the CT scans was able to identify which patients had suffered visible traumatic brain injuries. Moreover, the study showed that the blood test detected symptoms of concussions, even when brain injuries were not visible on the CT scan.\n\nThe team then tested blood serum from the same patients, which was taken less than 6 hours after their injuries. ""With our blood test, we were able to identify the presence of brain injuries 94 percent of the time,"" said Papa. ""This simple blood test was nearly as accurate as a state-of-the-art CT scan.""\n\nEven more impressive, the blood test also gave doctors an indication of how severe the brain injury was. ""We were looking at different types of brain lesions detected by the CT scans, ranging from mild to serious injuries, and found that the biomarker we tested for actually corresponded to the injuries. Levels of the biomarker were lower in mild cases, and were much more elevated in severe case,"" said Papa.\n\nThe biomarker this particular blood test looks for is known as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These proteins are found in glial cells, which surround neurons in the brain.\n\nWhen there\'s an injury to the brain cells, the GFAP are released. What makes them unique is that they pass the blood-brain barrier and enter the bloodstream, which makes them easy to detect with this particular test.\n\nCurrently, almost all concussions in children are diagnosed only by symptoms, which are either observed, like vomiting or balance problems, or symptoms that are reported by the child, like headaches, blurred vision or feeling groggy. Neither scenario gives doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury.\n\nCT scans can provide a more definitive profile of the injury, ""however, they are expensive and are associated with radiation exposure,"" said Papa. ""You really want to minimize the amount of CTs you do to your patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it.""\n\n""If there was a simple diagnostic tool like a blood test that can tell us quickly and accurately if a brain injury has occurred, and how severe it might be, that would be ideal,"" said Papa. ""That\'s what we are striving for with this project.""\n\nIn fact, Papa envisions the development of mobile devices that could diagnose concussions on the spot, much like the devices diabetics use to test their blood with a simple finger prick and a drop of blood.\n\n""The idea is to get a point-of-care test that could be used on the field, to help the coaches, the trainers and the athletic directors, make a decision then and there about whether the child should go back to play,"" said Papa.\n\nIt\'s estimated nearly a quarter of a million children a year are treated in hospitals for traumatic brain injuries like concussions, that occur while playing sports. That\'s an average of nearly 700 children a every day.\n\n""If we could find a simple test that takes the guess work out of diagnosing these kids, that would completely change the way we approach concussions and would certainly give parents greater peace of mind,"" said Papa.\n\nResearchers plan to do more studies with the blood test, but they hope it will be commercially available within the next 5 years.\n\n###']",Whenever you hear about a ‘simple blood test’ run for the hills cuz there ain’t no such thing.,"This news release describes a recently published journal article on a study that evaluated a blood test that was designed to detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children. The study reports that head injury causes the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from the brain into the bloodstream, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood correspond to the severity of the head injury. According to the release, the blood test correctly identified the presence of concussion or traumatic brain injury in 94 percent of the cases. But the release fails to mention that many positive results from the test would be false-positives, which would result in additional testing and may pose additional health risks. The release notes that concussion and traumatic brain injury are usually diagnosed based on symptoms — such as perceived balance problems or reports of headaches or grogginess — and that the blood test provides an objective test that can be used for diagnosis. However, the release fails to speak to a more important aspect of the marker, that is it’s potential negative predictive value. As noted in the study the biomarker has a 98% negative predictive value. That means that a negative result, if the biomarker holds up to additional testing, would rule out concussion.

But people looking to lose a few pounds may not want to go running to the produce aisle just yet. Scientists say there are no major human studies to support the idea that a berry holds the secret to weight loss.\n\nSome new weight-loss supplements, such as one from Swanson Health Products, center, use the Razberi-K brand of raspberry ketones, while others mix the ketones with substances, such as Reserveage Organics\'s Green Coffee Bean Extract, second from left.\n\nRaspberry ketones, the organic compounds that give raspberries their aroma, raised hopes as a weight-loss aid after a 2005 study by Japanese researchers found the ketones boosted fat-burning processes in rat cells in a laboratory as long as those cells were also exposed to a hormone known to help break up fat. The study, funded by a Japanese company developing a diet product no longer on the market, found that mice fed a high-fat diet plus raspberry ketones gained less weight than mice fed the high fat diet alone.\n\nSince you\'d have to eat a lot of raspberries to consume even a small amount of ketones, the compounds are being sold in a number of new weight-loss supplements. Some of the products use ketones extracted from real raspberries. Often they are synthetically manufactured in a laboratory, as is Razberi-K, a branded form of raspberry ketones sold by FHG Corp., in Spring Hill, Tenn., and used in about 30 companies\' products.\n\n""Razberi-K is perfect for those seeking stimulant-free support for a healthy weight-management program,"" says the website of Swanson Health Products Inc. in Fargo, N.D., which uses FHG\'s ingredient in its raspberry-ketone dietary supplement. The capsules, which went on sale last year, cost $3.79 for a month\'s supply of 100-milligram capsules taken twice daily, the company says.\n\nThe growing popularity of raspberry ketones comes despite no major human published studies. ""There is inadequate human data to support the idea that [raspberry ketones] actually cause weight loss,"" say Louis J. Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight-Control Program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York. Substances that cause weight loss in mice rarely end up working in humans, he adds.\n\nNatural Standard Research Collaboration is a scientist-owned group that evaluates natural therapies. In a recently-updated review, it gave raspberry ketones for weight loss a grade of ""C,"" which means the scientific evidence is unclear. ""It has not been well studied or well proven in the data we\'ve uncovered to this point,"" says Catherine Ulbricht, co-founder of the Cambridge, Mass., group.\n\nA study published by a Korean researcher in 2010 found adding raspberry ketones to fat cells in a laboratory stimulated production of adiponectin—touted by some companies as a fat burner. It is true that adiponectin is a beneficial protein, says University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center scientist Philipp E. Scherer, but its main known benefits are reducing the risk of diabetes and helping to redistribute fat away from unhealthy areas, such as the liver and belly.\n\nSo far adiponectin doesn\'t seem helpful in weight loss, he adds, and in fact studies of mice genetically altered to make more adiponectin showed the animals actually gained weight. That doesn\'t mean humans will gain weight if they make more adiponectin. ""The idea that it would actually cause weight loss is probably incorrect,"" says Dr. Scherer.\n\nThe Japanese study states that the chemical structure of raspberry ketones is similar to synephrine, a stimulant. For this reason people with cardiac issues or high blood pressure should avoid them, says Dr. Aronne.\n\nTim Ziegenfuss, who conducted a 10-person monthlong human safety study of Razberi-K, says there were no side effects and none of the subjects reported feeling jittery. Dr. Ziegenfuss declined to provide a copy of the study\'s results for this column. FHG, which funded the study and does business as Integrity Nutraceuticals, also declined to provide a copy. The company says adiponectin is only ""one part of the complex puzzle"" and shouldn\'t be used to determine if the product is effective. FHG said it has had no customer complaints of stimulant-like side effects.\n\nThe Japanese study used synthetic ketones, according to study lead author Chie Morimoto, an associate professor at Matsuyama Shinonome Junior College in Japan. But several companies use natural ketones as a selling point. Simply Raspberry Ketones, a product from JJSmith Group Inc.\'s aProvenProduct.com unit, contains the ""purest natural"" ketones and sells for a suggested retail price of $68 for a month\'s supply of 500 milligram capsules, according to the company\'s website.\n\nSeveral companies mix raspberry ketones with other natural weight-loss remedies that have been studied more. ""We\'re encouraged"" by the raspberry ketone research, says Rob Maru, president of innovation and brand development at Reserveage Organics LLC, in Gainesville, Fla., but ""as a stand-alone it doesn\'t comply with our standards"" for sufficient human research. The company\'s Advanced Solutions Green Coffee Bean Extract with raspberry ketones, costs $34.99 for a month\'s supply.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com']","Maintaining an objective tone, this WSJ piece managed to communicate the silliness of claims being made about raspberry ketone supplements.","Turning to three different experts in the areas of weight loss counseling, natural remedies, and obesity research, this story brought home the point that there is virtually no evidence to support the use of raspberry ketones for weight loss.

(Nasdaq: GHDX) today announced that the Journal of Surgical Oncology published results from a multi-center study of the Oncotype DX® DCIS Score™, demonstrating the test has significant impact on the treatment recommendations for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), also referred to as stage 0 or pre-invasive breast cancer. These study results underscore the practice-changing clinical utility of the test for many of the 50,000 women diagnosed with DCIS each year in the United States alone.\n\n""Most patients with DCIS are treated with surgery followed by radiation, yet only about 20 percent of them are likely to experience a recurrence or develop an invasive form of the disease,"" said Michael Alvarado, M.D., associate professor of surgery, the University of California, San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""These results highlight the need to optimize treatment of this non-invasive, indolent form of breast disease, and the importance of Oncotype DX in helping physicians reduce over- and under-treatment of DCIS.""\n\nDCIS affects one out of every five women diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States, and is often treated with surgery followed by radiation therapy and/or hormonal therapy. The Oncotype DX DCIS Score result provides patients with an individualized estimate of local (in the same breast) recurrence, which could be either invasive breast cancer or DCIS. This information helps physicians and patients personalize treatment decisions to potentially spare women with low risk of recurrence additional treatment they may not need, while identifying women with a higher risk of recurrence who may need additional treatment after surgery.\n\nConducted in collaboration with Partnership for Health Analytic Research, this prospective study analyzed 115 patients from 10 cancer centers in the United States. The results showed that physician treatment recommendations changed for 31 percent of patients after receiving the DCIS Score result, reducing the number of patients receiving a radiotherapy recommendation by approximately one-third. Importantly, of the patients initially recommended not to receive radiotherapy, 32 percent were identified as having a high risk of recurrence and recommended to have radiotherapy. Physicians in this study rated the DCIS Score as the most important factor in planning treatment compared with pathologic features, patient preference, patient age, comorbidities or consultation with other physicians.\n\n""The Oncotype DX DCIS Score result was validated in two studies including nearly 900 patients and is the only genomic test for patients with pre-invasive breast cancer,"" said Phil Febbo, M.D., chief medical officer, Genomic Health. ""The publication of this clinical utility study clearly demonstrates that the Oncotype DX DCIS Score can play a key role in enhancing cancer care for patients with DCIS, and we believe that these results will support expanded adoption of and access to the DCIS Score.""\n\nAbout Oncotype DX®\n\nThe Oncotype DX® portfolio of breast, colon and prostate cancer tests applies advanced genomic science to reveal the unique biology of a tumor in order to optimize cancer treatment decisions. The company\'s flagship product, the Oncotype DX breast cancer test, has been shown to predict the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit as well as recurrence in invasive breast cancer. Additionally, the test predicts the likelihood of recurrence in a pre-invasive form of breast cancer called DCIS. With half a million patients tested in more than 80 countries, the Oncotype DX tests have redefined personalized medicine by making genomics a critical part of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

The terminology employed by this news release is likely to be confusing to many readers.

But the headline refers unambiguously to “DCIS Breast Cancer.” We think the release could have done a better job of capturing the controversy over the very name for this condition, what it means, and the confusion it causes women. There are also some important gaps in the information provided about the study and the test. The news release doesn’t mention the costs of this new test or acknowledge that the study did not assess clinical outcomes among patients (only changes in treatment recommendations that may or may not be appropriate).

It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and results were to be presented Wednesday at a meeting of American Heart Association in Chicago.\n\nThe so-called DEFINE trial involved 1,623 patients with coronary heart disease or at high risk for it. All were taking statins to lower LDL cholesterol. Roughly half also received ancetrapib, while half got a placebo. On average, within 24 weeks patients getting ancetrapib saw LDL levels drop by nearly 40 percent compared with the placebo group, while their HDL levels rose by 138 percent. There were no significant side effects.\n\nIf the same benefit were seen in all patients at risk of heart disease – far from a sure thing – it would translate to hundreds of thousands of fewer deaths and heart attacks over a five-year period, according to Dr. Christopher Cannon, the lead study author and a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\n“It’s an amazing result,” said Dr. Robert Eckel of the University of Colorado, a past president of the American Heart Association. “It’s like a rocket that landed on Jupiter, rather than the moon.” Still, Eckel warned it’s too soon to say whether ancetrapib would actually prevent disease over the long run.\n\nThere’s ample reason for caution. A similar medication, torcetrapib, was considered promising four years ago, but was shelved by Pfizer after studies found it actually raised blood pressure and the risk of heart problems and death.\n\nDr. PK Shah, cardiologist at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, said that he’s encouraged by DEFINE but that some of the details give him pause. “It appears to be safe and to not raise blood pressure,” Shah told CNN, “but it’s not a slam-dunk.” For one thing, despite improved cholesterol levels, patients did not see less inflammation in their blood vessels. Inflammation is a sign of damage from cholesterol.\n\nTo try to provide final answers, Merck is launching a study – called REVEAL – to follow 30,000 people, in several countries, over four years. The first patients will be enrolled in April, according to Dr. Rory Collins of Oxford University, where the research will be overseen.\n\nLee Davies, a Merck spokesman, said the company is not likely to seek FDA approval until those results are in, most likely in 2015. By then, results will also be in on a large study of a similar drug, dalcetrapib, made by Merck’s competitor, Roche.']","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">The most glaring flaw in the story is that it sings in harmony with drug company marketing campaigns that equate elevated cholesterol with heart attacks and death. There is a relationship, but it’s far more complex and subtle than most people realize. Journalists have a responsibility to seize opportunities to counter popular myths. This story misses a chance to question the cholesterol dogma.</span>","



If things go well with future experiments and clinical use, we may someday look back on this trial as a turning point for this new class of drugs that affect how our bodies manage cholesterol, but this story takes the corner too fast. The results of the trial of anacetrapib give researchers confidence that they can safely proceed to the next round of testing without exposing patients to the life-threatening side effects caused by a similar drug, torcetrapib. However, this story (which misspells the drug’s name throughout the online version) emphasizes potential, but uNPRoven, health effects. There is good material in the story, including several cautionary statements (deep in the story) about how anacetrapib has yet to demonstrate it can save lives or reduce disease. It also reports that the trial was sponsored by the company developing the drug, though it fails to point out the financial ties of the researcher that is quoted.

The preoperative “evaluation” is a fishing expedition of sorts, in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur, to see whether it’s operable. Many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas, and the wait can take weeks in the hospital. Cognitive scientists use this opportunity, with patients’ consent, to present memory tests and take recordings.\n\nThis approach — called direct neural recording, and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes — has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory. This study used data from 150 patients, and had 20 collaborators from institutions around the country, including Emory University, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn a series of experiments, the researchers had patients memorize lists of words and later, after a distraction, asked them to freely recall as many of the words as they could. All the while, the scientists monitored a handful of “hot spots” in the brain which, previous work had shown, were strongly related to memory encoding. Before the stimulation tests, the team determined the precise settings for each patient’s high- and low-functioning states.\n\nEach participant carried out the word-memorization tests repeatedly, with different words every time; some lists were memorized with brain stimulation, and other lists with no stimulation, which served as a control. The authors then examined memory performance based on whether stimulation arrived during low- compared with high-functioning brain states.\n\nThe team then statistically analyzed the results and found that people scored slightly higher than usual on words when stimulation arrived during a low or foggy state — and worse, when the pulse arrived in a high state. “The average enhancement effect was about 12 to 13 percent,” Dr. Kahana said. “And when stimulation arrived in a good state, the average was about 15 to 20 percent worse than usual.”\n\nDr. Doris Greenblatt, a psychiatrist who participated in the trial at Emory, said she sought the surgery because her epilepsy had long caused memory problems. “Each seizure I had tore at the fabric of memory, and it was as if my memories weren’t attached to anything,” Dr. Greenblatt said.']","This research is a step forward in the field, but it’s a long way from what doctors call “clinical applicability”–meaning that it has been proven safe and effective.","This New York Times story describes research that may, in the future, lead to technologies that may help people with memory problems, such as those who have had a traumatic brain injury. Although the technique of brain stimulation has been used before to try to enhance memory function, sometimes it has been found to help and other times to hinder remembering. The current study shows that timing of the stimulation is possibly important, and tends to help memory when “people are in a low or foggy state,” while hindering it otherwise.
The story’s headline misrepresents the findings–at this point, we’re far from knowing if this “pacemaker for the brain” can indeed help memory among people with traumatic brain injury, dementia or other diseases. It also needed more on the cost of brain implant surgery, and the risks associated with the devices and their installation.

Most Americans don\'t get the 25 to 38 grams a day that\'s recommended, depending on age and gender.\n\nBut if you\'re skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you\'re a teenage girl.\n\nA study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics concludes that eating lots of fiber-rich foods during high school years may significantly reduce a woman\'s risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nThe findings are based on a long-term study of 44,000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school. The women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years.\n\nThe researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber (28 grams per day, on average) had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate low levels of fiber (14 grams per day, on average). For the women on the high-fiber diet, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by 16 percent.\n\nOf course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. It\'s well-known that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water. Prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease. There\'s also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management.\n\nThis new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit.\n\n""This is a really important study ... [suggesting] that the more fiber you eat during your high school years, the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer,"" says Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at the Duke Cancer Center.\n\nIn a commentary accompanying the study in Pediatrics, Blackwell writes, ""There is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels."" And this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe authors point to other possible explanations, too. For instance, high-fiber diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity, since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable.\n\nMaryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. Adolescence is ""a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,"" she says.\n\nOne limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be ""recall bias"" — the women\'s memories may be foggy.\n\n""The recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned,"" writes Blackwell. On the other hand, she says, ""people\'s dietary habits don\'t really change a lot. ... In general, what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life.""\n\nSo, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers?\n\nThis is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children\'s Hospital, has thought about a lot.\n\nShe says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating. ""Unfortunately for teenagers, they\'re [into] instant gratification,"" and they\'re not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health, she says.\n\nBut, she says, explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention. ""Most teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer,"" says King. ""So I feel like that touches a nerve with them.""\n\nGiven the known benefits of high-fiber diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease, the government\'s Dietary Guidelines for Americans also say most people need to consume more.\n\nWomen are advised to consume 25 grams a day. Men are advised to consume 38 grams a day.\n\nSo, how best to reach these targets? ""Add fiber at each meal,"" says King, in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts or seeds. Pears are a great bet with 7 grams of fiber apiece.\n\nAnd check out fiber-rich snacks, like popcorn and edamame.']","Despite some strong reporting, this story leaves readers with a misleading impression of the size of the benefit seen in the study.","This story focuses on a recent study from the journal Pediatrics, which found that women who ate more dietary fiber during adolescence and young adulthood had a lower risk of developing breast cancer. The story does a nice job of addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the study — as does a competing story we reviewed from CBS. However, the story would have been even better if it had used more appropriate language in the headline. This type of study can’t prove cause and effect, and so it can’t really tell us whether fiber “may help protect against breast cancer.” The story also should’ve tried to give readers a sense of the absolute risk reduction seen in those who ate more fiber. While the story reports a 16% lower lifetime risk in the high fiber consumers, this is a relative risk reduction that we believe is misleading. Our calculations suggest that the absolute rate of breast cancer was 3.3% for the lowest fiber consumers vs. 3.1% for the highest fiber consumers, a mere 0.2 percentage point difference.

Results were published November 2 in the Obesity Journal.\n\nWhile the Weight Management Center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes, many people with the condition don\'t live near a specialized program and need help that\'s readily available. O\'Neil said because Weight Watchers has centers all over the country, including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities, its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetes-specific counseling.\n\nThat\'s why he said it was important for MUSC to be involved in the study, which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program, Weight Watchers. Promoting healthy communities is part of MUSC\'s mission.\n\nThe multi-site study\'s results were statistically and clinically significant, O\'Neil said.\n\n""The Weight Watchers people were significantly better off than people who received standard care."" They achieved better control of their blood sugar and lost more weight, he said. They still had diabetes, but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking.\n\nThe study\'s 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctor\'s care for uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. Half got standard care: a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials. The other half went to Weight Watchers meetings, had access to Weight Watchers\' online materials and had two phone consultations and follow-up email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the Weight Watchers plan to help with their diabetes.\n\nParticipants had four follow-up visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes.\n\nAfter a year, people in the Weight Watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight, compared to 2 percent for the standard care group. The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes. Left uncontrolled, the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves, putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It can also cause eye problems, kidney damage and even lead to amputations.\n\nRisk factors for Type 2 diabetes include:\n\nBeing overweight\n\nNot getting enough exercise\n\nBeing 45 or older\n\nHaving a family member with Type 2 diabetes\n\nCertain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk, including African-Americans and Hispanics. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, which is caused by an immune reaction, Type 2 diabetes develops over the course of years. So incremental improvements such as the ones seen in the MUSC-led study are important.\n\n""It wasn\'t a huge, overwhelming difference,"" O\'Neil said. ""But it was scalable, meaning it could be applied to the whole population.""\n\nThe whole population of people with Type 2 diabetes includes more than 20 million Americans. It\'s by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about $85,000 in medical costs.\n\nDiabetes is a growing problem. O\'Neil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012. Weight loss is seen as a good way to slow its progression.\n\nThe MUSC Health Weight Management Center takes a scientific approach to weight loss, focusing on changes in activity levels, behavior, thinking, diet and support systems. O\'Neil said it\'s important to help people, not blame them.\n\nThe Weight Watchers study is new evidence of what that help might include when it comes to a side effect of weight gain: Type 2 diabetes. ""You do have some power and control,"" he said. ""You can lose some weight and lower your blood sugar - and may even be able to change your medications. That\'s no small feat in treating diabetes.""\n\n###']","When weighing benefits and evidence of any intervention, it’s useful to know if there are vested interests behind the claims.","This news release issued by the Medical University of South Carolina describes results of a multi-center study funded by the Weight Watchers corporation to assess the value of its dietary and communal approach to weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes.
Over a year’s time, half of the 563 patients with diabetes and obesity or were overweight in this randomized, partially blinded study received standard care including nutrition counseling and written educational materials. The other half were assigned to attend community-based Weight Watchers meetings, had access to the company’s online educational materials, and also had phone consultations and email contact with special diabetes educators who advised them about how to adapt the Weight Watchers meal plans to their diabetes medications and other factors. The results were statistically significant but very modest: both groups lost modest amounts of weight: 4 percent of body weight in the Weight Watchers group and 2 percent of body weight in the standard-of-care group and similarly small increases in the overall rates of long-term blood sugar control. The release would have been improved had it  disclosed the numerous ties the lead researchers have with the Weight Watchers corporation and some hard numbers to describe the study’s outcomes and the overall small impact of the Weight Watchers program.

Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture and cause a blood clot to form on the plaque’s surface. If the blockage isn’t treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. This heart damage may go unrecognized and lead to severe or long-lasting problems.\n\nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a surgical procedure that improves blood flow to the heart by bypassing clogged arteries. CABG was once thought to be too risky for patients with the long-term effects of coronary artery disease: left ventricular dysfunction (when the left side of the heart is unable to pump normally) and heart failure (when the heart can’t pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs). Early studies of the safety and effectiveness of CABG excluded most patients with these conditions. The procedure was typically used to relieve disabling angina, or chest pain.\n\nA team led by Dr. Eric J. Velazquez of Duke University Medical Center conducted a 5-year randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of CABG on patients with coronary artery disease that shows sign of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. More than 1,200 patients were included in the clinical trial. They were randomly assigned to receive either CABG plus medical treatment or medical treatment alone. The medical treatment included guideline-directed medications and devices. Patients had follow-up evaluations every 4 months for the first year and then every subsequent 6 months.\n\nAn extension study evaluated the 10-year outcomes of the surgical intervention. Almost all the participants were included in the 10-year follow-up results. The research was funded by NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Results were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine on April 3, 2016.\n\nDeath from any cause occurred in 359 patients (59%) in the CABG group and in 398 patients (66%) receiving medical treatment alone. A total of 247 patients (41%) in the CABG group and 297 patients (49%) in the medical treatment group died from cardiovascular causes. In addition, the bypass surgery was associated with an overall 1.4-year increase in median survival time (7.7 vs. 6.3 years).\n\nThese results show that CABG improves survival for people with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure.\n\n“The current 10-year follow-up provides new important insights about patient subgroups that are more likely to benefit from CABG as compared to medical therapy alone,” explains NHLBI Director Dr. Gary H. Gibbons. “As such, we now have a solid evidence base to inform patient care and the future development of clinical practice recommendations.”']",This news release delivers good info on heart bypass surgery outcomes but harms and costs were absent.,"This news release describes extended outcomes of a large, randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery plus medical treatment with those of medical treatment alone on patients with dysfunction or failure of their heart’s pumping function.

Proponents of screening argued that the study is the largest ever conducted and provides strong support for guidelines of the American Cancer Society and other groups calling for regular screening of women in this age group. But critics charged that the study was poorly designed and potentially vastly misleading. A major criticism of the study was that it made no attempt to weigh the risks of mammography against the benefits.\n\n\n\nLast November, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which was established in 1986 to assess the value of preventive medical techniques, concluded that mammography for women in their 40s was probably not a good idea. The panel concluded that screening could reduce the risk of dying by about 15% among women in their 40s. But the risks of false positives and invasive procedures associated with them largely outweighed the potential benefits of the procedure. The costs are also high, the panel concluded. About 1,900 women in their 40s would have to be screened to save one life, the panel concluded, and that is a poor return on investment. In contrast, for women over 50, about 1,300 need to be screened to save one life.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, a study from Norway concluded that the routine mammography may not even be all that beneficial for women older than 50. Those researchers found that improvements in breast cancer awareness and new treatments for the disease were the prime drivers in reducing the death rate from breast cancer and that routine mammography may contribute as little as 2% to the reduction.\n\n\n\nThe new study was released at a news conference and published online in the journal Cancer on Wednesday and is to be presented Friday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology\'s Breast Cancer Symposium in Alexandria, Va. Epidemiologist Hakan Jonsson of Umea University in Sweden and his colleagues took advantage of the fact that, since 1986, about half of Sweden\'s counties have offered routine mammography to women in their 40s and half have not. Using a cancer registry, the team examined records for more than a million women in the two groups of counties. They found 619 breast cancer deaths among women in the counties that offered screening, compared with 1,205 deaths in a similar group that were not screened. Overall follow-up was about 16 years. That amounted to a 26% reduction in deaths among women who were offered screening and a 29% reduction among those who actually received mammograms. The authors said that 1,250 women needed to be screened to prevent one death.\n\n\n\nCritics, however, noted that the researchers did not provide mortality rates, which made it difficult to compare the results in the two groups of counties. Moreover, they counted only the women who received a diagnosis of breast cancer and died of it but did not compare the broader cancer death rates in the two groups. Some studies have previously shown, for example, that breast cancer rates were significantly lower in the counties where screening is now performed even before the start of the screening program, suggesting that women in those counties may be intrinsically healthier. And the researchers did not look at false positives or other adverse outcomes from the screenings.\n\n\n\nThe controversy over mammograms seems unlikely to be settled anytime soon. Until it is, perhaps the best advice for a woman comes from Dr. Jennifer C. Obel of the NorthShore University HealthSystem in Chicago, who serves as a spokeswoman for the oncology society: ""The critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best"" for them.\n\n\n\n-- Thomas H. Maugh II / Los Angeles Times\n\n\n\n']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">In the first paragraph the story included the perspective of critics who ""charged that the study was poorly designed and potentially vastly misleading"" and that it ""made no attempt to weigh the risks of mammography against the benefits.""  Essential emphasis and placement. But why weren’t the critics named? </span>","


 
This story about a study of mammography in Swedish women in their 40s puts the findings in the context of other recent reports and highlights the critiques of independent experts, thus helping readers to see that this is just one more piece of the puzzle. By including the number of women that needed to be screened in order to prevent one breast cancer death, the story gives readers a more realistic perspective on the percentage difference in death rates the researchers saw between areas that screened younger women and those that did not.

""Human donor corneas work very well,"" Griffith said. ""However, there is a shortage of good quality corneas that can be used for transplantation.""\n\nThe shortage means trouble for many of those whose corneas -- the clear surface at the front of the eye -- have been injured or damaged by illness. An estimated 5 million people in the world have an eye disease called trachoma that affects the cornea, and another 1.5 million to 2 million are thought to have developed cornea-related blindness through other diseases or trauma.\n\nFor more than a century, doctors have considered transplantation of corneal tissue from deceased donors to be the best treatment, the study authors wrote. Artificial corneas are another option, but they\'re difficult to implant into the eye and can cause side effects, the researchers said.\n\nIn the new study, researchers tested corneal implants that are ""biosynthetic,"" meaning they\'re created with the help of living tissues. In this case, the corneas are produced with the help of human collagen -- a kind of protein -- that\'s grown in yeast. The mock corneas were then placed into the eyes of 10 patients after the diseased corneas were removed.\n\n""We were pleasantly surprised that in six patients, vision improved from about 20/400 to 20/100, meaning that these patients could see objects four times farther away than before the operation,"" said Griffith, director of the Integrative Regenerative Medicine Center at Linkoping University in Sweden.\n\nThe researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients. With the lenses in place, they all had improved vision, Griffith said.\n\nWhy didn\'t they all get better vision immediately without the contact lenses? ""We believe that sutures used in this study resulted in roughness on the surface,"" Griffith said. ""The contact lenses compensated for the surface roughness, resulting in improved vision. We will use less disruptive sutures in our next clinical study, and this should correct this problem.""\n\nAs for side effects, Griffith said the patients didn\'t report any pain or discomfort, and there were no signs that their bodies tried to reject the corneas, a risk that people face when they get transplanted organs.\n\nAs for cost, Griffith said the biosynthetic corneas ""in theory"" should be cheaper than donated corneas. Griffith said a German study recently found that donated corneas cost about $2,500.\n\nThe next step in research, Griffith said, is to create a ""new generation"" of cornea implants and test them on a wider variety of patients.\n\nThe study appears in the Aug. 25 issue of Science Translational Medicine.\n\nDr. Mark J.

She works at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in New York City.\n\nFloaters become more common with age, and although some people simply get used to them, others are bothered by them or their vision is impaired.\n\nThe new research was led by Dr. Chirag Shah and Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston. They explained that, currently, there are three management options for floaters: patient education and observation; surgery; and a laser procedure known as YAG vitreolysis.\n\nHowever, Shah and Heier said there are few published studies on the laser treatment\'s effectiveness in treating floaters.\n\nThe new study involved 52 patients with floaters who received one session of either the YAG laser treatment or a ""sham"" placebo laser treatment.\n\nSix months after treatment, 54 percent of patients in the YAG group reported significantly greater improvement in floater-related visual disturbances, compared with only 9 percent of those in the placebo group.\n\nNineteen patients (53 percent) in the YAG group reported significantly or completely improved symptoms, compared with none of the patients in the placebo group, the researchers added.\n\nThe patients in the YAG group also had improvements in several other measures, including general vision and independence, compared with those in the placebo group, the findings showed.\n\nThere were no differences between the two groups in harmful side effects, according to the study, which was published July 20 in JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\nA limitation of the study was its small size and short follow-up period, the researchers said. ""Greater confidence in these outcomes may result from larger confirmatory studies of longer duration,"" the study authors wrote.\n\nFor her part, Goldberg said that although ""there was significant improvement in patients\' symptoms following treatment, and no significant complication was seen,"" these findings are early and ""it is difficult to predict the long-term safety of this laser procedure.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Eye Institute has more on eye floaters.']",The risks and expense of the treatment must be taken into account when deciding to treat a benign disorder.,"This HealthDay story does a good job discussing this study for laser treatment of “eye floaters,” taking care to mention important limitations of the research.

Using this threshold in routine practice could potentially double the number of patients suitable for immediate discharge directly from the emergency department, say the authors.\n\n""Until now there were no quick ways to rule out a heart attack within the emergency department,"" explains lead author Dr Anoop Shah from the University of Edinburgh in the UK. ""We have identified a cardiac troponin concentration (less than 5 nanograms per deciliter; <5 ng/L) below which patients are at very low risk of heart attack either during the admission or in the ensuing 30 days. These patients are therefore potentially suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department. These findings could dramatically reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and provide substantial cost savings for healthcare providers.""[2]\n\nOne of the most common causes of hospitalisation worldwide is acute chest pain. In the UK alone, chest pain is responsible for around 1 million visits to the emergency department every year. International guidelines recommend that individuals presenting with chest pain are admitted to hospital for testing for very high levels of troponin (above the 99th percentile)--a sign that a heart attack has occurred. Current approaches for assessing patients with suspected heart attacks either require admission into hospital or lengthy stays in the emergency department for repeat testing. Until now, whether new high-sensitivity cardiac troponin tests could identify very low-risk patients who may be suitable for immediate and safe discharge from the emergency department was unknown.\n\nThe test used in this study is more sensitive than the standard version and can detect far lower levels of troponin in the blood. Using this test, troponin levels were measured in over 6000 patients with chest pain admitted to four hospitals in Scotland and the USA. Dr Shah and colleagues prospectively evaluated the negative predictive value (the probability that patients were not at risk) of heart attack or subsequent death from a heart condition after 30 days for a range of troponin concentrations.\n\nThe researchers found that a troponin threshold of <5 ng/L at presentation identified around two-thirds (61%) of patients at very low risk of heart attack and may have been eligible for early, safe discharge--with a high negative predictive value of 99.6%. This high negative predictive value persisted irrespective of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, or prior cardiovascular disease. At one year, these patients had a three times lower risk of heart attack and cardiac death than those who had troponin levels 5 ng/L or higher.\n\nAccording to Dr Shah, ""Over the last two decades the number of hospital admissions due to chest pain has tripled. The overwhelming majority of these patients do not have a heart attack. This study shows that low plasma cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation identify up to two-thirds of patients who are at very low risk of heart attack and could be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. Use of this approach is likely to have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers.""[2]\n\nWriting in a linked Comment, Louise Cullen and William Parsonage from the Royal Brisbane and Women\'s Hospital, Queensland, Australia, and Martin Than from Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand, say, ""The ultimate validation for the safety and efficacy of discharging patients with cardiac troponin concentrations less than 5 ng/L will be the report of clinical outcomes after this threshold is implemented in routine clinical practice...Finally, what further assessment, if any, is needed for those patients identified as low risk and suitable for early discharge? Trials are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of clinical pathways that involve no further testing for such patients.""\n\n###\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\nThis study was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Chief Scientists Office (Scotland).\n\n[1] A troponin test measures the level of troponin proteins in the blood. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, like during a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin there will be in the blood. Even a slight increase in the troponin level will often mean there has been some damage to the heart. Very high levels of troponin are a sign that a heart attack has occurred.\n\n[2] Quotes direct from author and cannot be found in text of Article.']","A pretty good breakdown on the basics of this study and its implications, but there was room for more context.","This news release describes the results of a study designed to significantly advance the search for a rapid blood test that can rule out evidence of heart muscle damage in people who come to emergency rooms with chest pain and other symptoms of heart attack. The study, reported in the journal The Lancet, specifically offers compelling evidence that a version of a commonly used blood test may indeed further that quest.
For the study, investigators used a highly sensitive version of an existing blood test that detects the protein troponin on more than 6,300 consecutive people presenting to hospital emergency rooms (mostly in Scotland) with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The researchers were able to determine the probability that patients were NOT at risk of heart attack or death from heart attack after 30 days for a range of troponin levels.
The release does a generally adequate job of describing how the high-sensitivity test appears to identify very low levels of troponin, in contrast to current troponin tests, thus making it theoretically possible to accurately, relatively quickly, and safely rule out a heart attack in more than 60 percent of such people, at least over the short term. It covers the fact that conventional troponin testing detects only higher levels of the protein, and must be done on serial blood samples over a longer period of time. And the news release puts appropriate emphasis on the potential the new test has for decreasing unnecessary hospitalizations and reducing health care costs.
All that said, the release could have done a much better job of making clear earlier in the text that substantially more research will be needed to determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of relying heavily on high-sensitivity troponin testing. Although the release uses qualifiers such as “may have been eligible for early safe discharge,” we think more needed to be said about potential risks, about the potential costs of the more sensitive test; and most of all about the limitations of the study and over-reliance on any single test when people experience heart attack symptoms.

But an updated look at the study indicates that heart disease patients who follow this advice may actually increase their risk for death.\n\nThe original ""Sydney Diet Heart Study,"" was initially conducted between 1966 and 1973, at a time when the cholesterol-lowering benefits of all polyunsaturated vegetable acids (PUFAs) were touted with a broad brush.\n\nBut in the ensuing years, researchers have come to understand that not all PUFAs are alike, with key biochemical differences -- and perhaps varying cardiovascular impacts -- observed among multiple types of omega-3s (found in fish oils) and omega-6 linoleic acids.\n\n""There is more than one type of polyunsaturated fatty acid,"" explained Dr. Christopher Ramsden, who headed the re-analysis and is a clinical investigator with the laboratory of membrane biophysics and biochemistry at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\n""And so, we were interested in trying to evaluate just one of these compounds, linoleic acid, by looking at this old trial using modern statistical methods, and also by re-including some original data that had gone missing from the first analysis,"" Ramsden explained.\n\nThe findings appeared online Feb. 5 in the BMJ.\n\nThe 458 male participants in the original study had been between the ages of 30 and 59 at enrollment, and all had a history of heart disease, with most having survived a heart attack.\n\nThe men were placed into two groups. The first group was told to consume linoleic acid, in the form of safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine, at levels equal to 15 percent of total calorie intake. This, said Ramsden, is equivalent to roughly twice the amount that Americans currently consume.\n\nWhile omega-3 consumption was not affected, the men were also asked to lower their saturated fat intake so that it made up less than 10 percent of their diets. They did so by substituting safflower oil for animal fats, common margarines and shortening oils, salad dressings, baked goods and other products, according to the study.\n\nThe second group continued their routine nutritional habits, and both groups kept food diaries and underwent regular assessments during the three-year-plus study period.\n\nBy newly crunching all the original data the NIH team found that, compared to the no-dietary-change group, the linoleic acid group faced a higher risk of death, from both heart disease specifically as well as from all causes overall.\n\nIn turn, Ramsden\'s investigators included their Sydney conclusions in a new review of all studies to date exploring the impact of omega-6 consumption.\n\nDespite the fact the American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that 5 percent to 10 percent of all calories come from polyunsaturated fat (principally from omega-6), the NIH team found no evidence to support the notion that linoleic acid confers health benefits. The review highlighted the possibility that boosting omega-6 consumption may actually increase the risk for developing heart disease.\n\nRamsden acknowledged that the Sydney study had been narrowly focused on a specific group of people: middle-aged men with a history of heart disease, who were asked to consume linoleic acid in quantities far exceeding both AHA guidelines and the dietary habits of most Americans.\n\n""So, yes, one of the limitations of this kind of study is always the question of its generalizability to other populations,"" he cautioned.\n\nBut he also suggested that his team\'s rigorous look back offered valuable insights into how nutritional science has evolved.\n\n""What to many people had at one time seemed pretty straightforward in the 1960s has turned out to form a much less black-and-white picture,"" he said. ""Polyunsaturates are not just involved in cholesterol-lowering. They may also be involved in inflammation, oxidation or clotting. So, it\'s a very complex picture. And though our goal is not to come up with diet advice, it may be that our conclusions will have important implications for nutritional guidelines.""\n\nOn that score, American Heart Association spokesperson Penny Kris-Etherton, a registered dietician and professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, suggested that the controversy concerning linoleic acid is not new and will continue.\n\n""But I don\'t think this is going to change AHA recommendations,"" she said. ""Because there\'s very robust evidence showing the cardiovascular benefit of linoleic acid. The AHA science advisory board did not just look at one study or a couple of studies. There are lots of studies that form the basis for their guidelines.""\n\n""So, I don\'t think anybody should get alarmed and change their diet,"" Kris-Etherton said. ""Those who are concerned should wait for more research to come out on this topic before taking any drastic measures to change their eating habits in a way that could be harmful.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on AHA guidelines regarding linoleic acid, visit the American Heart Association.']","This story attempted to address some complicated nutrition science, but didn’t quite measure up. ","The main strength of the story was an independent perspective from an American Heart Association expert who provided valuable context about the problem of reading too much into the results of a single study. The major weakness was the failure to distinguish between vegetable oils that are almost entirely omega-6 linoleic acid (e.g. corn and safflower oil), about which the study raises significant concerns, and those that have a balance of linoleic acid and omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. canola and soybean oil), about which there is less worry. The treatment of the statistics was also unsatisfactory, as was the explanation of why the results are novel and different from previous research.

Because of that, researchers do not yet know the median survival.\n\n“You don’t need to wait for 50 percent of 675 patients to die to conclude that one drug is much better than the other,” said Dr. Antoni Ribas of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was an investigator in the trial and has been a consultant to the developer of the drug.\n\nThe other new drug, ipilimumab (pronounced ip-ee-LIM-yoo-mab), when combined with dacarbazine, extended median survival to 11.2 months compared with 9.1 months for those who received dacarbazine alone. After three years, 20.8 percent of those who got that new drug were alive, compared with 12.2 percent of those in the control group.\n\nThe results of both trials were published online by The New England Journal of Medicine in addition to being presented here.\n\nTo be sure, more than half of patients with metastatic melanoma would not be helped all that much by either drug. Experts say more needs to be done, especially since melanoma affects more young adults than many other types of cancer.\n\nEven if the new drugs allow patients with metastatic melanoma to live two years, “Two years is nothing when you’re 30,” said Dr. Anna C. Pavlick, head of the melanoma program at New York University.\n\nStill, doctors and patient groups welcomed the progress because until now treatment of melanoma that had spread beyond the skin to distant organs “was terrible even by routine cancer standards,” said Dr. Vernon K. Sondak, chairman of cutaneous oncology at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso, the number of melanoma cases has been rising, unlike for many other types of cancer. Doctors say that is because of unprotected sun exposure years ago, the proliferation of tanning salons and perhaps more attention to detecting the disease.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere were about 68,000 new cases of melanoma and about 8,700 deaths last year in the United States, up from 48,000 cases and 7,700 deaths in 2000, according to the American Cancer Society. Particularly fast increases have occurred among people older than 65 and among women 15 to 39 years old.\n\nVemurafenib is the latest so-called targeted therapy, which inhibits the effects of genetic mutations that spur tumor growth and spread. In particular, the drug counters the effect of a mutation in a gene called B-RAF that was discovered in 2002 to be common in melanomas. (The drug’s name comes from V600E mutation in RAF.)\n\nThe drug, which is taken orally twice a day, would be used only by the roughly half of melanoma patients whose tumors have this mutation. The drug significantly shrinks tumors in about half of these patients — or about a quarter of all melanoma patients.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, it was approved in March and is sold under the name Yervoy.\n\nA series of articles in The New York Times last year followed the development of vemurafenib, then known as PLX4032, and recounted how some patients close to death seemed to make miraculous recoveries.\n\nThe effect, however, typically lasts only about seven months before the cancer starts to grow again, though some patients benefit for more than two years.\n\nS. Taylor Chance, a 67-year-old real estate agent in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., has been taking vemurafenib in a clinical trial since March 2010. “If it weren’t for the trial I wouldn’t be here,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt has not been all good. Ms. Chance said the drug caused such extreme pain at one point that “I called in the children and said, ‘I’m done, I can’t do this any more.’ ” But she had her dose reduced and took other medications for the pain.\n\nIn the trial, sponsored by Roche and led by Dr. Paul B. Chapman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, 38 percent of participants had to stop taking the drug or lower the dose because of side effects, including rash and joint pain. Many patients get minor skin cancers that can be removed by dermatologists.\n\nThe trial of ipilimumab, paid for by Bristol-Myers, involved 502 patients with late-stage melanoma.\n\nLast year at this conference, researchers presented results of a trial showing a survival advantage for patients who had undergone a previous treatment. The new trial of this drug, by contrast, involved patients who were getting treated for the first time.\n\nWhile the extension of median survival of two months, from about 9 months to about 11 months, was less than some experts expected, researchers said the real benefit was that a small number of patients, perhaps 10 to 20 percent, could live a long time.\n\nBecause it unleashes the immune system, ipilimumab can have serious side effects. In the latest trial, a big one was liver damage.\n\nA course of treatment of ipilimumab costs $120,000.

The findings appear in an upcoming issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (CJASN).\n\nPatients with chronic kidney disease are advised to follow dietary recommendations that restrict individual nutrients such as phosphorus, potassium, protein, and sodium; however, empirical evidence suggests that these restrictions—which can be difficult to abide by—have limited effects on reducing patients’ risk of premature death.\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that overall eating patterns may have greater effects on patients’ health and longevity. To investigate, a tem led by Giovanni Strippoli, MD, PhD (University of Bari, in Italy and Diaverum, in Sweden), and Jaimon Kelly (Bond University, in Australia) analyzed the medical literature, finding 7 relevant studies that included a total of 15,285 participants.\n\nHealthy dietary patterns were generally higher in fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, whole grains, and fiber, and they were lower in red meat, salt, and refined sugars. In 6 studies, healthy dietary patterns were consistently associated with a 20% to 30% lower rate of mortality, with 46 fewer deaths per 1000 people over 5 years. There was no significant association between healthy dietary patterns and risk of kidney failure.\n\n“Chronic kidney disease now affects about 10% to 13% of the adult population and substantially increases risks of cardiovascular complications and early death,” said Prof. Strippoli. “In the absence of randomized trials and large individual cohort studies, this study is the best available evidence to drive clinical decision-making by patients and doctors on whole dietary approaches in chronic kidney disease.”\n\nStudy co-authors include Suetonia Palmer, PhD, Shu Ning Wai, MSc, Marinella Ruospo, MSc, Juan-Jesus Carrero, PhD,and Katrina Campbell, PhD.\n\nDisclosures: The authors reported no financial disclosures.\n\nThe article, entitled “Healthy Dietary Patterns, Mortality and End-Stage Kidney Disease in CKD: A Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies,” will appear online at http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/ on December 8, 2016, doi: 10.2215/CJN. 06190616.\n\nThe content of this article does not reflect the views or opinions of The American Society of Nephrology (ASN).

Collaboration with Ping Wang, associate professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania\'s Perelman School of Medicine, enabled the design and implementation of the key clinical validation study.\n\nSymptoms, judgment, waiting\n\nIn rural or underserved areas, doctors sometimes must rely on a patient\'s symptoms or use their own judgement in looking at test sample color results to determine whether a patient has an infection. As expected, this process is often inaccurate. If they send results off to a lab in a distant city, the doctors sometimes must wait for days -- by which time the infection may have become widespread. Most existing mobile health diagnostic devices, meanwhile, can only analyze one sample at a time.\n\nSmartphone vs. lab tests\n\nThe WSU researchers found that their portable smartphone reader worked nearly as well as standard lab testing in detecting 12 common viral and bacterial infectious diseases, such as mumps, measles, herpes, and Lyme Disease. The researchers tested the device, which is about the size of a hand, with 771 patient samples at Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and found that it provided false positives only about one percent of the time (was 97. to 99.9 percent accurate).\n\nThe smartphone reader, which includes a portable device, takes a photo of 96 sample wells at once and uses a computer program to carefully analyze color to determine positive or negative results.\n\n""This smartphone reader has the potential to improve access and speed up healthcare delivery,"" said Li. ""If we find out about infections, we can treat them more quickly, which makes a difference especially in low-resource, remote areas.""\n\nLow-cost components\n\nBuying the components themselves, the research team was able to build the device for about $50, but the manufacturing cost would probably be lower than that, he said. They have filed a patent and hope to move forward with clinical trials that could lead to commercialization.\n\n###\n\nThe work was supported by a WSU fund to support entrepreneurial endeavors.']",It’s a huge leap from the lab to field use in the real world. This release ignores the many steps and considerations that must be dealt with in between.,"This news release about a smartphone-based infectious disease testing device confuses speed and device cost with benefits to patients and public health. It oversimplifies infectious disease detection and response. In their published study, the researchers reported an important achievement: comparable accuracy (under ideal conditions) with existing lab devices. However, the release doesn’t point out vital distinctions between performance in the lab and in real-world field use, or between the cost of a device and the total cost of a public health program that uses such a device.
The release does not put the status of this device into context with other similar devices being developed by universities and companies around the world. We note that the release does report the funding source and the commercial intentions of the researchers.

This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. The blood test called, Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ is commercially available in the U.S. through Epic Science\'s partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX). The research was published online today in JAMA Oncology.\n\n""This liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient\'s life,"" said Howard Scher, M.D., who led the study and is the co-chair, Center for Mechanism Based Therapy and Head of the Biomarker Development Initiative at MSK. ""During the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, physicians will now be able to use AR-V7 status to determine when a patient\'s cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy, enabling the patient to live longer.""\n\nThis blinded four-year study followed 142 mCRPC patients who were treated at MSK, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with ARSi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells. The results were that patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had superior overall survival (OS) relative to those treated with ARSI therapy (median OS, 14.3 vs. 7.3 months). Importantly, patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARSi therapy had superior OS relative to those treated with taxanes (media OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months). Additionally, the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group, to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables.\n\n""We developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer: which treatment should be pursued next? This question weighs heavily on doctors and patients, but now, with the Oncotype DX AR-V7 test, we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes,"" said Ryan Dittamore, chief of medical innovation at Epic Sciences and a co-author on the study. ""In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient\'s outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug.""\n\nThis is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. Earlier this month, Dr. Andrew Armstrong of Duke Cancer Institute presented data validating the test in the PROPHECY clinical trial at the ASCO 2018 Annual Meeting. The PROPHECY study investigated the AR-V7 test in patients receiving ARSi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from ARSi therapy.\n\nIn March of this year, based upon earlier studies utilizing the test, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test.\n\nThe paper is entitled, ""Assessment of the Validity of Nuclear-Localized Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.""\n\nAbout the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ Test\n\nDesigned by Epic Sciences and based on results from multiple studies led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test is the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind that can potentially prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by helping their physician identify the most effective treatment. Through a blood draw, the test detects AR-V7 protein in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells utilizing Epic Sciences\' No Cell Left Behind® platform to accurately identify patients who are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies and who should instead switch to chemotherapy.

As many as three balloons were placed over three months, and all of the balloons were removed after six months. The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained.\n\nIn addition to the balloons, patients followed a moderate diet and behavior modification program. Whether the weight loss will last over the long term isn\'t known, said lead researcher Dr. Aurora Pryor, director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center at Stony Brook University in New York.\n\nThe study lasted a year, but ""we don\'t know what happens after that,"" Pryor said.\n\n""If they are able to stick to their newfound lifestyle with their diet and exercise program, they could maintain their weight loss,"" she said. ""The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs.""\n\nThe balloon treatment will be available starting in January, but the cost hasn\'t been announced, Pryor said. The device, called the Obalon Balloon System, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAn advantage of the balloons is that patients have no downtime and can go back to work the same day, the researchers said.\n\n""There is no sedation or recovery time when the balloons are placed, but there is sedation when the balloons are removed, so you wouldn\'t want to go back to work after that,"" Pryor added.\n\nPryor believes balloons are a better option for patients who are candidates for weight loss surgery but don\'t want surgery. ""For people who want to lose some weight but don\'t feel they are heavy enough for surgery or they\'re afraid of surgery, this is a really good next step to help them jump start their weight loss,"" she suggested.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and the Obesity Society in New Orleans. Research presented at meeting is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nOne weight-loss expert expressed some doubts about the findings.\n\n""I still question the efficacy of balloons,"" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""While there is potentially easier insertion that does not require sedation, I still doubt after removal there will be weight loss,"" he said.\n\nRoslin said patients who have other treatments that restrict their ability to eat -- such as bands and bypass operations that reduce the size of the stomach -- often regain lost weight over time. ""As time goes on, weight loss will be about lifestyle changes,"" he said.\n\nThe only argument for the balloon is that it starts the lifestyle changes, Roslin said. ""It may make it easier to become motivated,"" he said. ""But I believe that few will maintain weight loss two years after any balloon.""\n\nFor the study, Pryor and her colleagues randomly assigned nearly 400 obese patients to receive a real or sham device. All patients also had 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy every three weeks. After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed.\n\nDuring the time patients had the balloons, and for six months after, the researchers monitored their weight loss. The investigators also followed those who had not received the balloon therapy.\n\nPeople treated with the balloons lost an average of 7 percent of their weight, compared to less than 4 percent for those who received the sham device, the researchers found. Six months after the balloons were removed, nearly 90 percent maintained the weight loss they achieved during treatment, Pryor said.\n\nAs for side effects, one patient had a bleeding stomach ulcer while taking high doses of pain pills after a knee replacement. Most patients (91 percent) suffered from stomach cramps and nausea, which nearly 100 percent said were mild or moderate.\n\nThe results were also presented at a medical meeting in May.\n\nOne health and nutrition expert noted that a balloon does not equal a lifestyle change.\n\n""A gastric balloon may help with weight loss, but will do nothing to improve diet quality and overall health,"" said Dr. David Katz. He is director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center in Derby, Conn., and president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine.\n\nThe role for such technology-based approaches to weight control should be a small one, he said.\n\n""Such devices may be alternatives to bariatric surgery in some cases. But they should not distract us from the far better solution at the population level: practices, programs and policies that make eating well and being active a cultural norm,"" Katz said.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more on obesity.']",It also alerted readers that this sort of medical conference presentation does not go through the peer review process that major journals use.,"Credit: FDA safety materials on Obalon
This story about a balloon swallowed by people with obesity to help them diet and lose weight is more informative than the associated conference news release we also reviewed.
The overall tone of the story balances the positive spin from a researcher with skeptical comments from independent sources. It alerts readers that this sort of medical conference presentation does not go through the peer review process that major journals use.
However, the story should have noted that the research was sponsored by the company that makes the device. It could have done a better job pointing out that the main difference between this device and other intragastric balloons already on the market is that this one doesn’t require patients to be sedated during placement. The story also didn’t point out that this type of device could cause life-threatening complications, and that the fact none were reported in this trial could be because fewer than 200 participants received the balloons.

Valley was the first hospital in northern New Jersey where an innovative technique – called pre-pectoral placement of a tissue expander -- was utilized during breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy. The procedure results in diminished post-operative pain, quicker recovery time, improved mobility, and an excellent aesthetic outcome for patients.\n\nThe technique has the potential to be a “game-changer,” says Tzvi Small, M.D., Director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at The Valley Hospital, who performed the breast reconstruction procedure on Hasbrouck Heights resident Vanessa Burt, 43.\n\n“This variation of a standard technique used during breast reconstruction will revolutionize the post-operative recovery in patients who meet certain criteria for the procedure,” notes Dr. Small. “Here at Valley, we are proud to offer this option for our patients and are excited about its potential for vastly improving patient care for women with breast cancer.” The technique involves placing tissue expanders (interim implants) under the skin on top of a woman’s pectoralis muscles after her breast tissue has been removed. After a recovery period of approximately two months — during which the woman’s chest skin heals, blood supply replenishes, and the expanders are gradually inflated to stretch the skin — the patient returns for an outpatient surgical procedure to replace the tissue expanders with permanent breast implants. In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period.\n\n“Over the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in breast reconstruction that utilize various types of surgical innovations, implants, and biologic tissue,” notes Dr. Small. “It is very rewarding as a reconstructive surgeon to continuously refine these procedures for our patients.”\n\nMs. Burt chose the Valley breast surgery team after carefully researching her treatment options for DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), a diagnosis that is often debated among clinicians as to whether it should be classified as breast cancer at all. In DCIS, abnormal cells have not spread beyond the milk ducts into adjacent breast tissue or lymph nodes. After consulting with several breast surgeons and reconstructive surgeons, Ms. Burt opted for a nipple-sparing mastectomy performed by breast surgeon Tihesha Wilson, M.D., Assistant Medical Director of Valley’s Breast Center. Immediately following in the operating room, Dr. Small performed the breast reconstruction. “This was a long journey,” says Ms. Burt, a publicist for the San Francisco-based Fat Wreck Chords music company. “Dr. Wilson was more than patient with me as I first chose active surveillance for one year and then decided to undergo a double mastectomy when another area of DCIS was identified in November 2015. I am also grateful for Dr. Small’s willingness to ‘look outside the box’ and for his determination to perform my reconstruction in a way that would give me the best results with the least amount of recovery time. I want to also commend the pathologists at Valley, who were exceptional in their diagnostic results.” Dr. Wilson and Laura Klein, M.D., Medical Director of the Breast Center, have extensive experience in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, a technically demanding surgery that is performed within aesthetically appealing minimally invasive incisions. With expertise in minimally invasive oncoplastic breast surgery, Dr. Wilson has also studied complementary medicine and provides her patients with a holistic, integrative approach to breast care. “It’s important to listen to each woman’s needs and then to decide together what is the best approach to treatment, so that in the end the cancer will be gone and the woman can move on with her life,” says Dr. Wilson.\n\nThe Valley Breast Center provides comprehensive diagnostic, surgical, and support services using a multidisciplinary approach. The Breast Center is designated by the National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers, a program of the American Cancer Society. Valley’s Breast Imaging Center has been named a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence by the American College of Radiology.']","Except in extraordinary circumstances, the result of one procedure on one patient isn’t enough to justify a news release.","It’s hard to ignore a news release that claims a reconstructive breast surgery technique is “innovative” and “has the potential to be a ‘game-changer,'” as does this one from The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey.
The release focuses on the outcome of one 43-year-old woman who received the hospital system’s first attempt at the surgery and is quoted extensively in the release. The procedure in question is available to some women who get a mastectomy following diagnosis, yet want an implant to recreate the appearance of their breast or breasts. After the breast tissue is removed, a balloon-like sac is temporarily placed in the void left behind and gradually filled with fluid. This prepares the skin and muscles nearby for a permanent implant, which is typically inserted a couple of months later for “an excellent aesthetic outcome.”
This all sounds wonderful, but our review team (which includes a breast surgeon) thought the release was nearly devoid of crucial context. It doesn’t adequately discuss costs, risks, evidence, or alternatives, and it doesn’t make clear how this procedure differs from similar, more common implant techniques. It also trumpets the outcome of one woman, whose experience with the procedure — while extremely positive — may not hold true for many women who elect to have mastectomies.
At best, this release is an incomplete advertisement.

story_reviews_00883,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/treating-sleep-apnea-without-the-mask/,2012-04-09 04:00:00,Treating Sleep Apnea Without the Mask,"['About 28 million Americans have sleep apnea, which causes repeated awakenings and pauses in breathing during the night, sometimes resulting in loud snoring and gasps for air. For decades, the standard treatment has been “continuous positive airway pressure.” A mask worn at night pushes air into the nasal passages, enabling easier breathing. C.P.A.P. reduces and in some cases completely prevents episodes of apnea.\n\nJoseph A. Golish M.D.\n\nBut the mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie: big, bulky and obtrusive. Many patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep. Studies show that about half of all people prescribed C.P.A.P. machines stop using them in one to three weeks.\n\n“For a lot of people out there, the C.P.A.P. machine turns into a doorstop,” said Dr. Joseph Golish, the former chief of sleep medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and now a professor with the MetroHealth System in Cleveland. “C.P.A.P. is very effective in the sleep lab. But when people go home, there’s a good chance they won’t use it, and the success rate of an unused C.P.A.P. machine is absolutely zero.”\n\nNow an alternative form of C.P.A.P. is gaining popularity: a patch that fits over the nostrils. Called Provent, the patch holds two small plugs, one for each nostril, that create just enough air pressure to keep the airways open at night. It is far less intrusive than the traditional C.P.A.P. machine. It is also more expensive, and it doesn’t work for every patient.\n\nApproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008, Provent has spread mostly by word of mouth. But it has caught on fast. Its manufacturer, Ventus Medical, says it has shipped one million of the devices in the past 12 months, up from a half million total in the two years prior. Doctors say it has given them a new weapon in the battle against sleep apnea, and many patients who struggled with C.P.A.P. call it a godsend.\n\nBob Bleck, who owns a computer networking firm in Ohio, struggled with poor sleep and chronic fatigue for decades. But it was only a year and a half ago that he finally went to a sleep clinic, prodded by his wife, who worried about his heavy snoring.\n\nThe diagnosis was severe sleep apnea. Tests showed that in a typical night, Mr. Bleck, 47, awoke or stopped breathing 42 times an hour.\n\nHis doctor prescribed a C.P.A.P. machine, and Mr. Bleck hated it.\n\n“I had this constricted feeling,” he said. “It would be incorporated into these dreams where I was tied up, like in the movie ‘Alien.’ It was more difficult to sleep with that thing on than to just get through the night with the apnea.”\n\nMr. Bleck got rid of the machine after he discovered Provent. “After I started using it, I noticed a difference right away,” he said. “My symptoms subsided dramatically.”\n\nProvent works like a traditional C.P.A.P. machine but is only a fraction of the size. When people with apnea fall asleep, their throat muscles collapse, constricting the airway and causing the body to fight for air. C.P.A.P. machines use mild air pressure to keep the airway from constricting.\n\nProvent does too, but in a different way. The device contains two pinhole-size valves, one over each nostril. The valves let air in easily — most people breathe through their nostrils while asleep — but there is resistance as the user exhales. That resistance creates a backpressure in the airways, dilating the muscles that would otherwise collapse in the middle of the night. In the morning, the patch is removed; a new one is used every night.\n\nLast year, in a large study of 250 apnea sufferers published in the medical journal Sleep and subsidized by Ventus, researchers found that those who used Provent devices over a three-month period saw their apnea episodes fall sharply, compared with people who were given a sham, or placebo, device. A follow-up study tracked people over the course of a year and had similar results.\n\nBut not everyone finds that Provent alleviates their apnea. In interviews, sleep specialists said that a third or more of patients do not end up using it.\n\n“It works like a champ in some people and doesn’t work on other people,” said Dr. Nancy Appelblatt, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in Sacramento who has prescribed it to about 100 patients. “All sleep apnea is not created equal.”\n\nSome people, for example, breathe through the mouth at night, not the nostrils. In those people, Provent typically doesn’t work. Nor will it work very well in someone who has severe nasal allergies and has a blocked nose at night, said one of the leaders of the Provent studies, Dr. Meir H. Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School and founder of the National Sleep Foundation.\n\nUnlike C.P.A.P., Provent is not covered by Medicare and most major insurers, though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future. In the meantime, a 30-day supply of the patches costs $65 to $80.\n\nDr. Lee A. Surkin, a cardiologist and sleep medicine specialist in Greenville, N.C., said patients typically start with a 10-day trial pack that costs $27.50. He has prescribed Provent to about 300 of his patients.\n\n“The No. 1 reason people don’t continue it is the out-of-pocket expense,” he said.\n\nFor now, Dr. Kryger and others say that C.P.A.P. will continue to be the gold standard, and certainly the first option for patients with severe apnea. But for the roughly 50 percent of patients in whom C.P.A.P. fails, Provent may be a reliable alternative.\n\nDr. Surkin said some patients use C.P.A.P. at home, but take their pocket-size Provent patches with them when they travel to avoid the hassle of lugging a machine through airports.\n\n“To me, it’s a miracle,” said Joyce Nemoga, 64. Ms. Nemoga, who lives in Baldwin Harbor, N.Y., has moderate apnea that caused her to snore and gasp in her sleep. She tried C.P.A.P. but could not sleep comfortably with the device.\n\n“Every time you turn over, you have to take the hose with you,” she said. “I tried it for six months, and I don’t think I had one full night of sleep the whole time.”\n\nA doctor suggested Provent, and Ms. Nemoga saw quick results.\n\n“I’m just so happy that I found it,” she said.']",We don’t doubt that some of the sleep apnea sufferers cited in this story are truly excited about being able to sleep without having a bulky device on their faces. But stories like this owe it to readers to separate individual enthusiasm from clinical evidence.,"This story missed half of our marks, despite including some very good information about costs and despite talking to a range of independent sources. If the story had spent a little less time echoing the device makers’ enthusiastic descriptions of the product and the breathless — no pun intended — descriptions by sleep apnea sufferers and more time drilling down into the evidence behind this device, it could have been a very well rounded piece.

Then, they isolated the white blood cells from each donor and studied inflammatory cell levels and the effect marijuana had on the cells.\n\n“The patients who didn’t smoke marijuana had a very high level of inflammatory cells compared to those who did use,” Kaminski said. “In fact, those who used marijuana had levels pretty close to a healthy person not infected with HIV.”\n\nKaminski, director of MSU’s Institute for Integrative Toxicology, has studied the effects of marijuana on the immune system since 1990. His lab was the first to identify the proteins that can bind marijuana compounds on the surface of immune cells. Up until then, it was unclear how these compounds, also known as cannabinoids, affected the immune system.\n\nHIV, which stands for human immunodeficiency virus, infects and can destroy or change the functions of immune cells that defend the body. With antiretroviral therapy – a standard form of treatment that includes a cocktail of drugs to ward off the virus – these cells have a better chance of staying intact.\n\nYet, even with this therapy, certain white blood cells can still be overly stimulated and eventually become inflammatory.\n\n“We’ll continue investigating these cells and how they interact and cause inflammation specifically in the brain,” Rizzo said. “What we learn from this could also have implications to other brain-related diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s since the same inflammatory cells have been found to be involved.”\n\nKnowing more about this interaction could ultimately lead to new therapeutic agents that could help HIV patients specifically maintain their mental function.\n\n“It might not be people smoking marijuana,” Kaminski said. “It might be people taking a pill that has some of the key compounds found in the marijuana plant that could help.”\n\n###\n\nMichigan State University has been working to advance the common good in uncommon ways for more than 150 years. One of the top research universities in the world, MSU focuses its vast resources on creating solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges, while providing life-changing opportunities to a diverse and inclusive academic community through more than 200 programs of study in 17 degree-granting colleges.']",Pot for thought?

There is no true quantification of the benefits of marijuana as a therapy for preserving cognitive function in AIDS patients, no context about the risks associated with smoking marijuana, no comparison to alternatives, no mention of costs, and not much in the way of explaining the strength of the study in question. This is especially problematic when it comes to marijuana. Like chocolate, marijuana is something that is often heralded for its health benefits, often with questionable findings underpinning the claims.

This approach saves many more lives than screening started at a later age or with less frequent exams. To mark National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, women are encouraged to ask their health care providers about scheduling an annual mammogram.\n\n""All women age 40 and over can benefit from annual mammography. Risk-based screening is a poor approach. Seventy-five percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history or other factors that place them at high risk for the disease. I encourage women to speak with their providers about mammography benefits and limitations and create a schedule to get their annual mammograms,"" said Debra Monticciolo, MD, FACR, chair of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Commission.\n\nBreast cancer remains the second leading cause of deaths among women in the United States. In 2015, according to the National Cancer Institute, 231,840 women will be diagnosed with the disease and 40,290 will die from it. Deaths are highest among women who are not screened regularly and have their cancers found at later stage.\n\n""Mammography screening is not perfect but has been shown to markedly reduce the number of women each year who die from breast cancer,"" said Elizabeth Morris, MD, FACR, president of the Society of Breast Imaging. ""The decision whether or not to get a mammogram remains with women. We want them to know that mammography can detect cancer early — when it\'s most treatable and can be treated less invasively — which not only saves lives but helps preserve quality of life.""\n\nThe ACR and SBI believe women 40 and older should have access to mammograms and that Medicare and private insurers should be required to cover them for these exams.\n\nFor information on mammography visit Mammography Saves Lives or the Society of Breast Imaging website.\n\nContact Shawn Farley at 703-648-8936 or PR@acr.org to arrange an interview with an ACR spokesperson.\n\nContact Joy Burwell at 202-263-2971 or jburwell@amplifypublicaffairs.net to arrange an interview with an SBI spokesperson.\n\nAbout the American College of Radiology\n\nThe American College of Radiology (ACR), founded in 1924, is a professional medical society dedicated to serving patients and society by empowering radiology professionals to advance the practice, science, and professions of radiological care.\n\nAbout the Society of Breast Imaging\n\nThe Society of Breast Imaging (SBI), established in 1985, is a professional medical organization dedicated to improving the practice of breast imaging and the quality of medical education in breast imaging.

Chan School of Public Health suggest that long-term, high intake of vegetable protein from such foods as whole grains, soy and tofu, may protect women from early menopause and could prolong reproductive function.\n\nConsuming enriched pasta, dark bread and cold cereal were especially associated with lower risk, while they observed no similar relation to eating animal sources of protein.\n\n""A better understanding of how dietary vegetable protein intake is associated with ovarian aging may identify ways for women to modify their risk of early onset menopause and associated health conditions,"" write first author and then-graduate student Maegan Boutot, with her advisor, professor Elizabeth Bertone-Johnson. Details appear in the current early online edition of the American Journal of Epidemiology.\n\nEarly menopause, the cessation of ovarian function before age 45, affects about 10 percent of women and is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and early cognitive decline, the authors note. Few studies have evaluated how protein intake is associated with menopause timing, they add, and to their knowledge this is the first to look specifically at early menopause.\n\nBoutot, Bertone-Johnson and colleagues in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at UMass Amherst, with others, evaluated the relationship between diet and risk of early menopause among members of the Nurses\' Health Study II (NHS2), an ongoing prospective study of 116,000 women aged 25-42 when they entered it in 1989.\n\nParticipants were asked to report how often they ate a single serving of 131 foods, beverages and supplements over the previous year, from ""never or less than once a month"" to ""6+ per day."" They observed that women consuming approximately 6.5 percent of their daily calories as vegetable protein had a significant 16 percent lower risk of early menopause compared to women whose intake was approximately 4 percent of calories.\n\nFor a woman with a 2,000 calorie per day diet, the authors explain, this is equal to three to four servings of such foods as enriched pasta, breakfast cereal, tofu and nuts, or about 32.5 grams a day. They adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index and other possible confounding factors.\n\nBoutot and Bertone-Johnson add, ""Though relatively few women in our study consumed very high levels of vegetable protein and our power for analyses of more extreme intake levels was limited, women consuming 9 or more percent of their calories from vegetable protein had a hazard ratio of 0.41 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.19-0.88)"" compared to those eating less than 4 percent.\n\nOthers on the study team were from Brigham and Women\'s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The study was supported by a grant from NIH\'s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nFor the NHS2, follow-up questionnaires have assessed nurses\' lifestyle behaviors and medical conditions every two years. Nearly 90 percent have continued to participate in followup. Diet was assessed five times over the 20-year study, allowing the researchers to capture within-person variation in changes in food and nutrient intake over times, Boutot explains. Participants in the study contributed more than 1 million person-years of follow-up, during which 2,041 women experienced early menopause.\n\nBoutot and Bertone-Johnson suggest that more prospective studies of their findings are warranted, including studies that compare soy-based and non-soy vegetable proteins.\n\n###']",We wish news releases based on observational studies were more upfront about limitations when describing the research. Adding a descriptor such as “these are useful findings that need further study” in a prominent place would help.," This news release reports on a study showing an association between eating plant protein and lower risk of early menopause. Researchers evaluated data from the Nurses’ Health Study II, a large-scale effort to identify risk factors of disease in women. The study appeared in the Journal of American Epidemiology. A sub-headline allows that the effect is “modest” but the news release headline implies a cause-and-effect relationship that can’t be proven with one study based on observing a sample group of people, particularly when the group is self-reporting and subject to errors in recall.
We have some tips on ways to write headlines for diet and observational studies in general that avoid the suggestion of cause and effect.

Currently, people with the disease can choose from a range of drugs that are administered by injection.\n\nPhysicians say many people are reluctant to stick themselves with a needle and would be more comfortable taking a pill once or twice a day. This could encourage a greater number of MS patients to take medication as needed and could spur earlier treatment, which is important since disability from MS is cumulative.\n\nCost of the new drugs is expected to be high. Novartis AG \'s Gilenya, so far the only oral MS drug on the market, is priced at about $48,000 a year; the drugs still being developed are expected to cost about the same. That\'s higher than injectable drugs currently in use, which cost roughly $40,000 a year. Health insurers often pick up most of the expense of MS drugs.\n\nThere is a ""tremendous desire"" among MS patients to begin using oral treatments because of their ease of use, says Joseph Herbert, director of the MS Care Center at NYU Langone Medical Center. Still, he says, many physicians are being cautious about prescribing the oral drugs because their side effects can\'t be fully assessed until they are used widely for an extended period of time.\n\nAmong its side effects, Gilenya can increase a person\'s risk of infection and potentially lead to toxicity of the liver and an eye disease called macular edema, clinical trials have shown. Some of the oral drugs still in development are expected to have somewhat milder side effects.\n\nThe current injectable drugs have generally less severe side effects, including injection-site irritation and flu-like symptoms, although some patients incur more serious problems such as liver damage.\n\nElizabeth Fuchs, an MS patient on Staten Island, N.Y., began taking Gilenya about two months ago. The 49-year-old was diagnosed with MS about 12 years ago and had tried several injectable medications. Avonex, made by Biogen Idec Inc., required weekly intramuscular injections. She later switched to Copaxone, from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which is administered with a daily subcutaneous injection.\n\n""It is just much easier to put a pill in your mouth and take a glass of water,"" Ms. Fuchs says. Not having to inject herself has made her feel more positive about having MS and even allows her to forget she has the disease, she says.\n\nThere is no cure for MS, a chronic, inflammatory condition that occurs when the body\'s immune system attacks its own central nervous system.\n\nMS, which affects about 400,000 people in the U.S., is marked by symptoms such as vision problems, limb numbness and paralysis. Women are more likely to get the disease than men, and genetic factors may make certain individuals more susceptible, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nGilenya, which received Food and Drug Administration approval last fall, is thought to work by reducing the quantity of circulating immune cells that can cause damage in an MS attack. More than 6,500 patients are taking the drug, according to the most recent Novartis data.\n\nRecent data from large clinical trials of other drugs being developed, including Biogen Idec\'s BG-12, Teva Pharmaceutical\'s laquinimod, and teriflunomide, from Sanofi-Aventis SA, show they are also effective at controlling MS flare-ups and slowing the progression of disability from the disease. More data on the drugs are expected later this year and, assuming FDA approval, they could all be on the market in late 2012.\n\nThe success of any of these drugs isn\'t guaranteed. Another oral MS drug, Merck KGaA\'s cladribine, was rejected by U.S. and European regulators earlier this year amid long-term safety-related questions, including an increased cancer rate in patients taking the drug. The company says it remains committed to gaining approval.\n\nAnother drug, Biogen\'s Tysabri, was approved in 2004 but was later temporarily pulled from the market after it was linked to a rare brain infection. Tysabri, administered by intravenous infusion, became available again in 2006 but is limited mainly to patients who don\'t respond to other treatments.\n\nA recent analysis by Novartis showed that Gilenya reduced relapses among MS patients by 54%. Disability progression was reduced by 30%, using a standard measurement of this process.\n\nBiogen\'s BG-12 drug reduced MS flare-ups by a similar amount as Gilenya, but with fewer side effects. Smaller reductions in flare-ups were seen in trials with patients using laquinimod (23%) and teriflunomide (31%).\n\nBy comparison, Avonex, one of the leading injectable drugs, has been shown to reduce MS flare-ups by 32% and disability progression by 37% over two years.\n\nPhysicians say MS cases vary greatly and some drugs won\'t work for certain patients. Also, it is difficult to directly compare two different clinical trials.\n\nNYU\'s Dr. Herbert says it is a challenge to get patients to use prescribed injectable therapies. Oral medications\' ease of use should increase the number of patients who use the drug as required, he says. This also is expected to encourage some patients, especially those in the initial stages of MS, to begin therapy before the disease advances significantly.\n\n""The data certainly suggest that starting therapy earlier does slow down the progression of the disease,"" says Timothy Coetzee, chief research officer for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nDoctors say they aren\'t likely to recommend a patient switch to one of the new oral drugs if an injectable drug currently in use is working. Although the ease of taking a pill, rather than an injection, is important, effectiveness of a given drug takes precedence. Patients who switch treatments run the risk of the new drug not being the right fit for them, says Mayo Clinic neurologist Mark Keegan.\n\nWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@dowjones.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Good job giving perspective on new pills that could replace shots for some patients with multiple sclerosis. </span>","While the headline makes it sound easy, the story gives useful context on just how different patients respond to different medications – both oral and injected. Managing multiple sclerosis is a complex balance in which each patient has to find the drugs that are the right “fit” for them. This story explains that balancing act.

The study, led by Tonya Orchard, an assistant professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, appears in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.\n\nWomen with the least-inflammatory diets (based on a scoring system called the Dietary Inflammatory Index) lost less bone density during the six-year follow-up period than their peers with the most-inflammatory diets. This was despite the fact that they started off with lower bone density overall.\n\nFurthermore, diets with low inflammatory potential appeared to correspond to lower risk of hip fracture among one subgroup of the study -- post-menopausal white women younger than 63.\n\nThe findings suggest that women\'s bone health could benefit when they choose a diet higher in beneficial fats, plants and whole grains, said Orchard, who is part of Ohio State\'s Food Innovation Center.\n\n""This suggests that as women age, healthy diets are impacting their bones,"" Orchard said. ""I think this gives us yet another reason to support the recommendations for a healthy diet in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.""\n\nBecause the study was observational, it\'s not possible to definitively link dietary patterns and bone health and fracture outcomes.\n\nRebecca Jackson, the study\'s senior author and director of Ohio State\'s Center for Clinical and Translational Science, said the new findings support a growing body of evidence that factors that increase inflammation can increase osteoporosis risk.\n\n""By looking at the full diet rather than individual nutrients, these data provide a foundation for studying how components of the diet might interact to provide benefit and better inform women\'s health and lifestyle choices,"" said Jackson, who is national chair of the Women\'s Health Initiative steering committee.\n\nPrevious studies have connected high levels of inflammatory markers in the blood to bone loss and to fractures in older women and men, which prompted Orchard and her colleagues to wonder what they\'d find if they took one more step back - to the dietary choices that contribute to inflammation in the body.\n\nThe Dietary Inflammatory Index - developed to assess the quality of diet from maximally to minimally inflammatory based on nutrients consumed - helped them accomplish that. Dietary information as well as data on bone density and fracture were collected from a large group of the participants in the Women\'s Health Initiative, the largest study of postmenopausal women\'s health undertaken in U.S. history.\n\nParticipants in the WHI were 50 to 79 when they enrolled in the study of prevention and control of common diseases impacting older women. Enrollment ran from 1993 to 1998.\n\nFor the new analysis - the first of its kind - the research team looked at dietary data from 160,191 women and assigned inflammation scores based on 32 food components that the women reported consuming in the three months prior to their enrollment.\n\nThe researchers used bone-mineral-density data from a subset of 10,290 women. Fracture data was collected for the entire study group.\n\nOrchard and her colleagues found a correlation only between high-inflammatory diets and fracture in younger white women in the study. Higher scores were associated with an almost 50 percent larger risk of hip fracture in Caucasian women younger than 63, compared with the risk for women in the group with the lowest inflammatory scores.\n\n""This suggests that a high-quality, less-inflammatory diet may be especially important in reducing hip fracture risk in younger women,"" the researchers wrote.\n\nBut in the study group overall, more-inflammatory diets were not linked to fracture and - in fact - the researchers found a modestly lower risk of lower-arm and total fracture in women with the highest dietary inflammation scores. One possible explanation included in the study: The women with lower inflammation scores were more physically active as a group and therefore were at a slightly greater risk of falls.\n\nWomen with the least-inflammatory diets had lower bone mineral density overall at the start of the study, but lost less bone than their high-inflammation peers, the researchers found. The lower bone density to start could be because women with healthier diets are more likely to be of a smaller build, Orchard said. Larger people have higher bone density to support their larger frames.\n\n""These women with healthier diets didn\'t lose bone as quickly as those with high-inflammation diets, and this is important because after menopause women see a drastic loss in bone density that contributes to fractures,"" Orchard said.\n\n###\n\nVedat Yildiz of Ohio State\'s Center for Biostatistics also worked on the study, which was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nCONTACT: Tonya Orchard, 614-292-7241; Orchard.6@osu.edu']",A mention of specific diets or foods and numbers illustrating the actual benefits would have made the release even better.,"This news release describes the results of an observational study that looked at the association of a scoring system called the dietary inflammatory index (DII), which aims to measure the inflammatory potential of certain foods, with risk of bone fractures in postmenopausal women. Researchers also looked at changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and compared them with DII scores. Over 160,000 women completed food frequency questionnaires at baseline and then again 3 years later, and information on bone fractures was reported at least every year. A smaller group of women (about 10,000) also had a procedure that measured their bone mineral density (BMD), which is an important factor in risk for osteoporosis and fractures.
Overall, the study did not find an association between a diet higher in inflammatory foods (based on the DII) and fracture risk. However, a higher DII score was associated with increased risk for hip fracture — but only in White women younger than 63 years. Women with the least inflammatory DII scores had less loss of hip BMD despite having a lower BMD at the start of the study, when compared with women that had the most inflammatory DII scores.
This release places the research into context for readers and provides important cautions about the observational and retrospective nature of the study design. Its language is measured, and it takes care not to hype the findings. We also liked how the release references a positive finding from a subgroup of the study without presenting the finding as if it were the main result. The release would have been improved with the addition of some measurement of benefits and some mention of the costs associated with a diet that would potentially lead to fewer bone density problems in older age.

Now, new research reported in the journal Pediatrics finds, the combination of camphor, menthol and eucalyptus oils actually does ease cold symptoms and help children suffering from upper-respiratory infections sleep.\n\nIn the study, funded by an unrestricted research grant from Procter & Gamble, makers of Vicks, researchers took 138 children between the ages of 2 and 11, with symptoms like cough, congestion, runny nose and restless sleep that lasted seven days or more. Only children with moderate cough and severe stuffy nose were eligible, and those were divided into three groups.\n\nSome were treated with Vicks, some with a placebo consisting of petroleum jelly and others got no treatment at all. Parents were surveyed the day before treatment about the severity of their child\'s symptoms. That night, 30 minutes before bedtime, Vicks or petroleum jelly was rubbed onto the child\'s chest and neck. The next day parents were questioned about their child\'s symptoms overnight.\n\nChildren in all three groups got better, but those treated with the VapoRub saw the greatest improvement, and parents in this group also had improved sleep, the study found.\n\n""The American Academy of Pediatrics says the currently available oral cough and cold medications are not effective for children and have the potential for side effects, "" said Dr. Ian Paul, principal investigator and associate professor of pediatrics and public health sciences, Penn State College of Medicine. ""This was based in part on some of the studies that we have conducted at Penn State.

""I have found that when used properly it can be a good option for parents who want to relieve some cold symptoms in their children.

Vicks is used topically on the skin, it\'s not ingested and is not included in these FDA guidelines.""\n\nShu says when used properly, Vicks appears to be safe. But as with any product, parents need to read the instructions carefully and keep medicines out of the reach of children. Vicks VapoRub is not recommend for children under the age of 2.']","This story packed in a lot of great information, but it also fell a little short when characterizing the strength of the results. Reporters should always take a hard look at the statistics being used to tout a study’s findings, especially when the research was company-sponsored.","



This story of a clinical trial of a generations-old cough and congestion remedy hits almost all the key points that we would expect of a report on even the most aggressive intervention for a life-threatening condition. Where it falls short is in describing the differences in symptom improvement reported by the groups given VapoRub, petroleum jelly or no treatment. Parents were asked to check boxes on a seven-point scale that went from 1=“not at all” through 4=”moderate” to 7=”very much or very severe.” By using a seven-point scale, instead of a three-point or five-point scale, the trial increased the chances of finding a statistically significant difference, while also increasing the likelihood that the difference would be so slight as to be meaningless. Moreover, in an industry-sponsored trial of which the lead author is a paid consultant skepticism is warranted. When the symptom scale used might detect clinically insignificant differences, and when several key aspects of study design are weak, the consumer should take VapoRub with a grain of salt.

A major government study found the screening scans saved the life of one person for every 300 current or former smokers who were scanned.\n\nBut now cancer and screening experts are worried that the limited findings will be used by private screening centers to promote the test to a broader group than was studied. That, in turn, could lead to thousands of unnecessary lung scans, causing excess radiation exposure and unnecessary biopsies and surgery.\n\nDr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said he was stunned to hear a radio advertisement for an Atlanta screening center cite the study just a few days after the government had announced the results. The wording of the ad seemed to be aimed at a broad group, ranging from heavy smokers to women who had never smoked, Dr. Brawley said.\n\n“We really need to weigh the harms associated with screening,” he said. “The scientific community still needs to digest this. To take a trial that involves people at high risk for lung cancer and to extrapolate it and say it’s good for people with intermediate or low risk is not appropriate.”\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, focused on a specific high-risk group: 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, who had smoked for at least 30 pack-years. That means someone who smoked one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years or three packs a day for at least 10 years would qualify for the study.\n\nFormer smokers who had accumulated 30 pack-years were included only if they had stopped smoking within the previous 15 years.\n\nThe smokers and former smokers were given either annual CT lung scans or chest X-rays. Compared with conventional X-rays, the CT, or computed tomography, scans create a detailed three-dimensional image of the lungs. The study was stopped when it was found that the scanning group had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than those being screened with X-rays.\n\nBut the early results also showed a downside of scanning: one of every four lung scans showed an abnormality, which often led to additional worry, radiation exposure from follow-up scans and, sometimes, lung biopsies and even risky surgery. But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away.\n\nReading the scans is tricky because harmless nodules can be misinterpreted as suspect lesions. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world.\n\n“There is a learning curve to reading spiral CTs,” Dr. Brawley said. “I’m concerned that some radiologists might be early in that learning curve and some patients may be harmed because of it.”\n\nWhile the study found a benefit to scanning a specific group of high-risk smokers, that doesn’t mean other groups will get the same benefit, says Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. In lower-risk groups, for instance, it’s likely that thousands of people would need to be exposed to the risks of screening before a single life was saved. And it’s possible that many of those scanned unnecessarily could be seriously harmed.\n\n“The aggregate harms to all the people’s lives who are not saved have to be taken into account,” Dr. Bach said. “Even in these highly controlled settings, about 1 percent of the people had surgery or a part of their lung removed for something they thought was cancer and it wasn’t.”\n\nLow-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms.\n\nFor now, most consumers who want a scan will have to pay for it themselves, although it is expected that insurance companies eventually will approve scanning for those in high-risk groups. (Medicare officials have indicated that they will soon reconsider paying for the screening tests.) The government has estimated the cost at about $300 a scan, but some centers may charge $1,000 or more.\n\nThe day the government announced the study results, Westside Medical Imaging of Beverly Hills, Calif., issued a press release saying that the study “should once and for all settle the controversy” about whether CT lung scans save lives.\n\nIn the release, Dr. Norman E. Lepor said the scans were an “indispensable” part of annual exams for patients who have smoked for 10 years.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Lepor said that he only offers lung scans to those at high risk, and that he turns people away who are at low risk but want the scan anyway because “they just want to know.”\n\nDr. Lepor said it would be “imprudent” not to incorporate the latest study data into his practice right away.\n\n“There are people who, with good conscience and their take of the data, say it’s not ready for prime time, and there are people who look at the same data and they come to other conclusions,” Dr. Lepor said. “This is not the first study that has supported screening. We know from our own anecdotes that we have saved a lot of lives.”\n\nDr. Lepor said that he had just met a woman who had smoked for 50 years and was concerned about her risk. “She’s the poster person for this test,” he said.\n\nDr. Brawley said he’s worried that the few early press releases and radio advertisements are just the beginning of widespread promotion of screening lung scans.\n\n“It was sort of ominous to be working Sunday evening in my home office and this thing comes on the radio,” he said. “A lot of people run out when there is a new announcement and get the new test. We’re very frightened some people are going to be harmed because of this.”\n\nA version of this article appeared in print on Nov. 16, 2010, on page D5 of the New York edition of The Times.']",One of the best such columns to appear in the ,"These were some of the special elements of this column:

""It\'s an indirect indicator the patient could be harboring polyps [precancerous growths in the colon],"" says Dr. Sreeram Maddipatla, medical oncologist/hematologist for the Liver Center and Pancreas Center at UF Health Cancer Center – Orlando Health. Although blood in the stool can mean there\'s a tumor or polyps, it can also be a sign of something much less serious, like hemorrhoids.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved two types of fecal occult blood tests and one stool DNA test:\n\nGuaiac FOBT. This was the first stool test for colorectal screening, says Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Mendelsohn says the concept for the guaiac FOBT originated from the idea that colon cancer bled into the colon and then into the stool. Guaiac FOBT detects heme – an iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen – in the stool. The guaiac FOBT is not specific to human heme, Mendelsohn says, so if you consume meat before the test, it could affect the results.\n\nTo do a guaiac FOBT, you\'ll use a kit to collect stool from three different bowel movements and send the samples to a lab for analysis. ""[The need for three samples] is due to the intermittent nature of bleeding from a tumor,"" Mendelsohn says. If you choose this method of colorectal screening, you\'ll need to repeat the test yearly.\n\nWhen a guaiac FOBT is performed every one to two years in adults 50 to 80 years old, it can reduce deaths from colorectal cancer by 15 to 33 percent, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nFecal immunochemical test, or FIT. The FIT detects human hemoglobin, Maddipatla says. It doesn\'t react to non-human blood, so there are no dietary restrictions prior to the test. Maddipatla says this test is easier than the guaiac FOBT, as it only requires one stool sample (which must be mailed back to the lab right away for an accurate result). Although other conditions, such as a lower gastrointestinal bleed, can produce a positive result, the FIT produces fewer false positives than the guaiac FOBT, Maddipatla says, and is almost equal to colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. The FIT is approximately 80 percent sensitive for detecting cancer and 20 to 30 percent sensitive for detecting advanced polyps. ""The colonoscopy is still the gold standard,"" Maddipatla says.\n\nUnlike a colonoscopy – a visual examination of the full length of the colon and rectum – the guiaic FOBT and FIT only detect cancers or polyps. A colonoscopy can help prevent cancer by removing polyps before they have a chance to develop into a tumor.\n\nMany patients prefer the simplicity of stool testing to undergoing a colonoscopy. However, if you have a positive result with either a guaiac FOBT or FIT, you may have polyps or colon cancer, and you\'ll need to proceed with a diagnostic colonoscopy, Mendelsohn says. ""There\'s no point in doing [stool tests] if you\'re not willing to do a colonoscopy afterwards.""\n\nFIT-DNA. You may have seen advertisements for the Cologuard FIT-DNA test. According to the NCI, Cologuard detects both tiny amounts of blood in the stool (the FIT portion) as well as nine biomarkers in three genes that have been found in colorectal cancer and advanced polyps. The NCI says for average-risk adults who didn\'t have symptoms, the FIT-DNA test detected more cancers and adenomas (advanced polyps) than the FIT, but had more false positives.\n\nMendelsohn says there are no long-term studies on FIT-DNA, so doctors aren\'t sure how frequently patients should undergo it. Medicare reimburses for the test every three years, she says, and depending on the manufacturer, the guidelines recommend repeating the test every one to three years. Mendelsohn says she is uncomfortable with the rate of false positives, which is about 10 to 13 percent. As with the guiaic FOBT and the FIT, a positive result means you still need to undergo a colonoscopy.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAdults at average risk for colorectal cancer should begin colorectal screening at age 50. Talk to your doctor about which test is right for you.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act and Medicare cover screening for colorectal cancer. Check with your insurer about which tests are covered and what your out-of-pocket costs might be.']","Fecal stool tests can be a reasonable screening test for some people, as long as folks are made aware of the constraints that accompany these tests.","In this brief story, the reporter describes three available fecal occult stool tests used to detect colorectal cancer.  The story compares the three on such dimensions as false positives and reductions in cancer deaths.
Since the story is largely descriptive, it is unfortuante that one of the important variables missing from the text is cost; the story only notes that these procedures are covered by Medicare.

Most of those trials were funded and run by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture Prozac and Effexor — Eli Lilly and Wyeth, respectively.\n\nThey included 12 studies of Prozac in adults and four each in elderly patients and youth, as well as 21 trials of immediate- or extended-release Effexor in adults. About 9,000 participants were included.\n\nMore adults and kids taking Prozac, known generically as fluoxetine, had at least a 50 percent improvement in scores on depression tests after six weeks compared to those assigned to take a placebo pill.\n\nFifty-five percent of adults on Prozac responded to treatment, compared to 34 percent in the placebo group. In youth, 30 percent on Prozac had significant symptom improvement, compared to just six percent of the comparisons.\n\nThe benefits were seen regardless of how severe patients’ symptoms were before starting treatment.\n\nHowever, in the elderly the differences between the treatment and placebo groups were much smaller, and the researchers calculated that 17 older patients would have to be treated with Prozac for one to gain from it.\n\n“Clearly the efficacy of antidepressants is age-dependent, (and) largest, most interestingly, in youth, which I don’t think would be the mainstream view in psychiatry,” Gibbons told Reuters Health.\n\nThe findings, he added, “raise other questions that need to be followed up (including), what’s going on in the elderly?”\n\nBoth types of Effexor, or venlafaxine, also seemed to help adults with mild to severe depression, with slightly more patients responding to the immediate-release dose.\n\nSome of the study’s authors have testified for or received funding from drug companies, though the report itself was funded by national health agencies.\n\nThe researchers said they couldn’t be sure there would be similar improvements with other types of antidepressants — especially given the more limited data in kids and the elderly — or that the longer-term benefits would be as clear.\n\nOne recent study suggested that up to a fifth of patients on the antidepressant Cymbalta (duloxetine) might actually benefit more from placebo pills (see Reuters Health story of December 9, 2011.)\n\nIrving Kirsch, who studies antidepressants and placebos at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the new report didn’t make him more optimistic about the drugs.\n\nIf five or more patients need to be treated with an antidepressant for one to substantially improve, most don’t get much out of it, he pointed out.\n\n“More than 80 percent of the patients are not getting a significant benefit from the drug — either they’re not getting better or they would get the same benefit with placebo,” he told Reuters Health.\n\n“There are alternative treatments for depression that also produce about the same symptom reduction as the drugs do, but without the risk of side effects,” Kirsch added, including psychotherapy and exercise.\n\nStill, Gibbons said that the improvement in symptoms for the average patient wasn’t insignificant.\n\n“Definitely it doesn’t look like antidepressants are placebos,” he concluded.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/AaNJqw Archives of General Psychiatry, online March 5, 2012.']",We applaud the concise and detailed explanation of the study’s results and offer just a few suggestions for improvement.,"Reporters usually don’t write the headlines, but we wish someone would have changed the headline on this story.  The body of the story conveyed important questions – about the number needed to treat – and about differences in treating the elderly – that perhaps were worthy of headline attention.

But working out the unique mutations of each person’s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them.\n\nIn two studies published in the journal Nature, researchers have shown promising results from Phase I clinical trials. While they are very small scale—one was on six participants, the other 13—the findings mean researchers can move ahead with the vaccines, which could potentially lead to new, more effective cancer treatments.\n\nTech & Science Emails and Alerts- Get the best of Newsweek Tech & Science delivered to your inbox\n\nIn the first study, scientists led by Catherine Wu developed a vaccine for people who had been treated for melanoma with surgery, but who had received no other treatment. They sequenced the DNA from the tumors then created a personalized vaccine that contained neoantigens (targets for the immune response) for predicted mutations.\n\nCreative Commons\n\nSix patients were given a full series of vaccinations, including five priming injections and two booster vaccinations. Four of the six had no recurrence of the disease after 25 months.\n\nIn the other study, by Ugur Sahin and colleagues, tested a personalized vaccine based on RNA (an essential link in the production of proteins encoded by DNA). They used a similar approach to Wu and her team to identify the mutations, then tested the vaccine on 13 people who were being treated for melanoma. All participants were found to have a boosted immunity against the antigens specific to their tumors. Eight were still tumor free after 23 months.\n\nBoth vaccines were deemed safe and are expected to be taken forward for further research.\n\nThese vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. Cornelius Melief, from the Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands, said in an accompanying News & Views article that controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trials will be needed to work out if the vaccines are effective. He added, however, that the studies confirm the potential of cancer vaccines.\n\nElizabeth Williams, from the School of Biomedical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology, tells Newsweek the two studies “describe tantalizing complementary and consistent results in Phase 1 trials in melanoma patients using vaccines.""\n\niT@c/Flickr\n\n""The vaccines are personalized for each individual’s tumours by harnessing technologies that enable the comprehensive analysis of the molecular fingerprint of the tumour,” she says. “The data shows that it is a safe and well tolerated strategy that stimulates relevant anti-tumor immune responses.”\n\nHowever, the treatment has its downsides: “As the vaccine therapies are designed and generated specifically for each individual there is a lag time from enrollment to commencement of treatment—approximately four months—which may be too long from some patients with advanced cancer. As technologies and processes continue improve this is likely to be reduced,"" she continues.\n\n“It is still unknown whether these vaccines will extend the survival of cancer patients, or whether they are more effective than other recently developed immunotherapies. Additional clinical trials will be required to determine the utility of these individualised neoepitope vaccines.”\n\nCatherine Pickworth, science communication officer at Cancer Research UK said: “The promising results from these two small, early-stage studies show that personalized cancer vaccines designed to treat skin cancer are safe to use, and that for some patients, they can successfully harness the power of the body’s own immune system to kill cancer cells. The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.”']","Although the two trials profiled in the Newsweek article are phase 1 safety trials, the article barely mentions safety and calls it a breakthrough — quite prematurely.","Ungrounded speculation or reasonable caution? Both are present in this Newsweek story on two very early trials of immunotherapy drugs being developed to protect against melanoma. While the headline calls the research “a cancer breakthrough,” quotes from researchers bring some much-need focus on the studies’ limitations.
These are — after all — phase 1 safety trials with just six volunteers in one and 13 in the other. Far too small a group to make any claims about successful results. The article does tell readers what questions remain about the vaccines (such as do they extend life and how effective are they compared with other treatments), and the type of research studies that are needed to answer these questions. However, noticeably absent from the story is a discussion about the exorbitant price tag associated with immunotherapy.

That makes it much safer than, say, systemic stimulants that also rev up the heart and other parts of the body and cause strong side effects, according to the research. Anyone remember fen-phen?\n\nFor now, the new approach has been demonstrated only in mice, according to the research, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.

""The drug or the pill is taken orally, and it tricks the body into thinking you’ve eaten a meal."" Yet the mice showed no reduction in appetite and continued to eat the same amount of food, the study showed.\n\nThe paper suggests that the drug may one day offer a nonsurgical alternative to ""vertical sleeve gastrectomies"" that have become popular in the battle against morbid obesity. More than a third of the U.S. population is considered obese.\n\nNearly 20 years ago, Evans\'s lab worked to identify the molecular switch that turns on a whole series of bodily responses to eating, including digestion, absorption, the transfer of nutrients by the bloodstream and increased blood circulation, to name a few. In mice at least, fexaramine turns on that switch and sets off the same cascade of reactions without any side effects, Evans said.

The drug contributed to development of brown fat, which helps burn calories, and relieves inflammation of cells in various tissues, which is the result of chronic obesity. It also reduced resistance to insulin, the hormone that helps cells absorb the glucose they use for energy. Many Type 2 diabetics become resistant to insulin and have to inject additional amounts.\n\nBut don\'t expect to be popping fexaramine any time soon.

Overall, this story says too much about things that have yet to be tested, and not enough about the hurdles that stand between this experimental drug and clinical approval.

During the study, more than 26,000 of the 440,000 participants, all with atrial fibrillation, were diagnosed with dementia.\n\nAt the time they joined the study, about half of the participants were taking oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, Eliquis (apixaban), Pradaxa (dabigatran), Savaysa (edoxaban) or Xarelto (rivaroxaban).\n\nThe researchers found that people taking anticoagulants were 29 percent less likely to develop dementia than were those who were not taking the blood thinners.\n\nWhen the researchers focused on people who continued to take the drugs, they found an even larger reduction (48 percent) in the risk for dementia. They also found that the sooner people started taking blood thinners after their diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, the lower their risk for dementia.\n\nAlong with not taking blood thinners, the strongest predictors for dementia were age, Parkinson\'s disease and alcohol abuse, according to the study, published Oct. 25 in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings strongly suggest that blood thinners reduce the risk for dementia in people with atrial fibrillation, but proving that would not be possible, the Swedish researchers said.\n\n""In order to prove this assumption, randomized placebo-controlled trials would be needed, but such studies cannot be done because of ethical reasons,"" researchers Leif Friberg and Marten Rosenqvist, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said in a journal news release. ""It is not possible to give placebo to [atrial fibrillation] patients and then wait for dementia or stroke to occur.""\n\nHowever, the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs, Friberg noted.\n\n""Patients start on oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention but they stop after a few years at an alarmingly high rate,"" he said. ""In the first year, approximately 15 percent stop taking the drugs, then approximately 10 percent each year.""\n\n""If you know that [atrial fibrillation] eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment, I think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on atrial fibrillation.']",Stories based entirely on news releases are likely to present an unbalanced and incomplete portrait of the research.,"A Swedish study of people who take anticoagulants suggests that these drugs are associated with lower rates of dementia.

Nor did the story acknowledge the researchers’ ties to numerous drug companies that make anticoagulants.
Many of the shortcomings of this story can be traced back to the news release that apparently sparked it.

TWO SERVINGS OF FISH TWO SERVINGS OF FISH The American Heart Association recommends at least two servings of fish each week for heart health. Types rich in omega-3 fatty acids are best. These are essential fatty acids that humans get through foods, including fish, nuts and some oils such as canola and flaxseed.\n\n\n\nScientists say the fatty acids are linked to heart health and brain function and may reduce inflammation. Research has shown omega-3 fatty acids decrease the risk of arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats), which can lead to sudden death, and triglyceride levels.\n\n\n\nWHICH FISH SHOULD YOU CHOOSE?\n\n\n\nMost omega-3 rich:\n\n• Salmon\n\n• Mackerel\n\n• Herring\n\n• Lake trout\n\n• Sardines\n\n• Albacore tuna\n\n\n\nLess omega-3 rich:\n\n• Cod\n\n• Haddock\n\n• Catfish\n\n• Sole\n\n\n\nSource: Fadi Nahab, M.D.,\n\nEmory University Hospital The steep rate of death from stroke in a swath of Southern states often referred to as America\'s ""stroke belt"" may be linked to a higher consumption of fried fish in that region, new research suggests. A study published in today\'s Neurology shows people living in the stroke belt — which comprises North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas and Louisiana — eat more fried fish and less non-fried fish than people living in the rest of the country, and African-Americans eat more fried fish than Caucasians. ""Differences in dietary fish consumption, specifically in cooking methods, may be contributing to higher rates of stroke in the stroke belt and also among African Americans,"" says study author Fadi Nahab, medical director for the Stroke Program at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The research, part of a large government-funded study, Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), involved 21,675 participants from across the country; the average age was 65. Of the participants, 21% were from the ""stroke buckle,"" the coastal plain region of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia where stroke mortality rates are even higher than they are in the rest of the stroke belt. Another 34% were from the rest of the stroke belt and 44% were from the other states. Participants were interviewed by phone and then given an in-home physical exam. The questionnaire asked how often they ate oysters, shellfish, tuna, fried fish and non-fried fish. The American Heart Association recommends people eat fish high in omega-3 fatty acids—essential fatty acids humans get through their diet—at least twice a week, baked or grilled but not fried. Fewer than one in four overall ate two or more servings of non-fried fish a week. Stroke belt residents were 32% more likely to eat two or more servings of fried fish each week than those in the rest of the country. African-Americans were more than 3.5 times more likely to eat two or more servings of fried fish each week than Caucasians, with an overall average of about one serving per week of fried fish compared with about half a serving for Caucasians. When it came to eating non-fried fish meals, stroke belt residents ate an average of 1.45 servings per week, compared with 1.63 servings eaten by people elsewhere. ""This is good stuff. It\'s a well-done study, but I think one thing to bear in mind is that it\'s not specifically a study of stroke risk. You\'re looking at a community and seeing how it\'s behaving on the whole,"" says Daniel Labovitz, a stroke neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. ""This study can\'t tell you causation. It can\'t tell you there\'s a direct link between one thing and another, it just tells you they\'re associated,"" says stroke neurologist Victor Urrutia, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. How might eating fried fish impact stroke? It could be that frying the fish leaches out the omega-3s, says Jeremy Lanford, stroke director at Scott & White Healthcare in Roundrock, Texas. Or the increased fat calorie content from the frying oil may contribute to stroke, says author Nahab. He also notes that fish used for frying, such as cod and haddock, tend to be the types lower in healthy fats. More research is needed to tease out whether cooking methods affect stroke risk, Labovitz says. ""In other words, is fried fish a problem, or is it another red herring?"" he says.

An already approved drug could be quickly available and would then be the first breast cancer prevention drug.\n\nAbout one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Causes can be the use of synthetic sex hormones and other environmental factors, but also gene mutations like in the BRCA1 gene (BReast CAncer). US actress Angelina Jolie who underwent a preventive double mastectomy is the most famous carrier of a „faulty“ BRCA1 gene. On average, women with this mutation have an up to 87% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Tumors usually develop early in life. Until now, prophylactic surgery is the only procedure which significantly reduces the breast cancer risk, but which is also often associated with postoperative complications.\n\nIn 2010, Josef Penninger, the scientific director of IMBA in Vienna and his team have shown that sex hormones can trigger breast cancer (Schramek et al., Nature) through proteins called RANKL and its receptor RANK, which are key factors in bone metabolism. RANKL and RANK also link sex hormones to breast cells by providing signals telling the breast cells to grow. This occurs normally in every woman during pregnancy and the menstruation cycle. However, if deregulated, mammary cells start to divide and multiply and fail to die when they should, ultimately resulting in breast cancer.\n\nA multinational research effort now made the discovery that RANKL is also the main driver of BRCA1 mutation-driven breast cancer. In the current study, Verena Sigl, graduate student from Penninger\'s research group, showed that blocking the RANKL/RANK system in BRCA1 mutant mice led to largely normal mammary glands whereas invasive carcinomas could be found in the control group. To determine the relevance of their results for humans, scientists in Vienna and Toronto isolated breast tissue cells from women who had undergone preventive mastectomy because of their BRCA1 mutation. In the human cell culture, too, RANKL inhibition led to a significant reduction of growth and spreading of breast tissue cells. Moreover, the scientists – together with colleagues in Barcelona and from the CIMBA* consortium mapping more than 23,000 women – showed that genetic variants in the RANK gene are associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer in women who carry BRCA1 and also BRCA2 mutations.\n\n""Our finding is so exciting because there is already an approved drug against RANKL called „Denosumab”. It is an antibody with very few side effects, which binds tightly to RANKL, thereby inhibiting its ability to act. Based on our discovery, the already approved drug Denosumab or other future drugs that will block RANKL/RANK, could be used for breast cancer prevention in BRCA mutation carriers,"" explains Verena Sigl.\n\nScientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have already tried the preventive use of a RANKL blocking drug in mice. Animals carrying BRCA1 mutations were divided into two groups. In the control group multiple early breast cancer lesions developed. The second group received RANKL blockade treatment for prevention with the result that virtually no malignant changes in breast tissue could be observed even over a longer period of observation.\n\nCareful phase III clinical trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy in humans. Thereafter, any woman who has been tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation could take RANKL blockade as prevention measure to reduce her dramatically increased breast cancer risk. Josef Penninger adds: “This work is a great example of an international collaboration of many scientists with one grand vision: Prevention of breast cancer. Cancer prevention is one of the key issues we face in medicine today, a world where much fewer women will get breast cancer in the first place. We have also shown that RANKL/RANK are critically involved in sex hormone-driven breast cancer. If the uncovered mechanism indeed works in the prevention of breast cancer in high risk patients, this could possibly be used to prevent breast cancer in general. One door for breast cancer prevention has now been opened and this can be tested very fast.”\n\nThe present work is the result of international collaboration. Scientists from Austria (IMBA, AKH Wien) participated as well as researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, Baltimore, USA; Toronto, Canada and Barcelona, Spain. See original publication for details.\n\n*CIMBA: http://www.apps.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/consortia/cimba/\n\nJosef Penninger’s studies at IMBA are largely supported by the 7.4 million US $ ""Innovator Award"" through the ""US Department of Defense”.']","Everyone is interested in cancer prevention discoveries, but alarm bells go off when we see findings from studies in mice and Petri dishes applied to humans.","This news release covers new published research around the use of a drug — denosumab — as a preventative treatment for those women who might have a genetic disposition to a certain type of breast cancer, those who carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. While this multinational research news release presents the discovery as hopeful and exciting, the leap from rodent studies to humans is likely long, tenuous and far from certain. The news release treats the benefits and evidence found in the research somewhat vaguely, but over-reaches in describing the potential application of denosumab in preventing breast cancer.

He wasn\'t doing his homework. He was being very difficult with his little brother. And he was just melting down day after day,"" Ellison says. ""So I decided to devote a year to trying out different approaches to see if we could make it any better.""\n\nIn recent years, more people have been trying an alternative approach called neurofeedback, a type of therapy intended to teach the brain to stay calm and focused. Neurofeedback is expensive, time consuming and still scientifically unproved. But, there\'s growing evidence that it can help.\n\nEllison says the idea appealed to her immediately.\n\n""Because I was always wary about using meds as a single approach or for very long, it seemed to be an interesting alternative. It\'s really like meditation on steroids,"" says Ellison, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting -- and who has ADHD herself.\n\nEllison has written a book about living with ADHD called Buzz: A Year of Paying Attention. And one chapter of the book is devoted to neurofeedback.\n\nTraining The Brain\n\n\n\nEllison says she tried meditation, but her mind kept wandering. Neurofeedback is better for people with ADHD, she says, because it provides constant feedback during a session, which is usually done in a therapist\'s office.\n\nPeople usually sit in a chair facing a laptop screen. The laptop is connected to electrodes applied to the scalp. Special software monitors the electrical activity in your brain. In particular, it measures rhythmic patterns known as theta and beta waves.\n\nProponents of neurofeedback say these patterns reveal when the brain is in a focused and attentive state. So the computer software looks for desirable brain wave patterns and changes the image on screen to let people know how they are doing.\n\ntoggle caption Catherine Avalone/The Middletown Press\n\nThe image that worked best for Ellison showed a field.\n\n""When my brain responded the way that it was supposed to, the field would burst into color. I\'d hear bird song and beautiful flowers would bloom,"" she says. ""But when I got distracted or when I got a little bit more sped up, the flowers would wilt. It would turn gray, and I\'d know that I needed to work a little bit harder.""\n\nAt first, people can\'t control their brain wave patterns, at least not consciously. But over time, their brains become conditioned to associate certain patterns with pleasant images or sounds -- a reward for good behavior. And our brains like rewards.\n\nThis sort of brain training can take 40 sessions or more, and typically costs thousands of dollars.\n\nPromising But Unproved\n\nEven though there are studies now showing that neurofeedback works for ADHD, all of these studies have serious limitations, researchers say. So the approach remains promising but unproved, says David Rabiner, a researcher at Duke University who writes a newsletter about treatments for ADHD.\n\nConsidering Neurofeedback For ADHD? A growing number of parents see neurofeedback as an appealing alternative to medication to treat their child\'s ADHD. The treatment is relatively simple and painless. First, a practitioner attaches three to 10 electrodes to the child\'s head. Each electrode sprouts a lead, or wire, connecting it to a computer. The child sits in front of a screen displaying images that respond to the child\'s brain activity. When the child has the right kind of brain activity — the images are rewarding or positive, for example — puzzle pieces might fall into place. Proponents say this helps encourage better behavior over time. Cynthia Kerson, executive director of the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, says her sessions with children last about 30 minutes and include breaks. Her own patients might have anywhere from 20 to 40 sessions, but some kids with ADHD struggle to sit still for even one session in the beginning. ""It can be quite frustrating for them,"" she says. Katherine Ellison writes that a course of treatment can cost $3,000 or more. Many highly trained doctors like Kerson offer the treatment, but the field has also attracted people with more dubious backgrounds. ""That\'s a big problem in our field because people can acquire equipment quite easily,"" Kerson says. Kerson said there are a few things parents should look for to ensure their neurofeedback practitioner is a professional. 1. Look for a clinician board certified by the Biofeedback Certification International Alliance who is either a licensed professional specializing in psychological or medical disorders, or working with someone who is. 2. Determine whether the practitioner is a good fit by having your child meet with him or her before agreeing to a treatment plan. 3. Verify that the practitioner is using up-to-date methods and equipment, since the field is changing rapidly. Ask what research backs up practitioner\'s methodology and what kind of training he or she has had. — Whitney Blair Wyckoff\n\n""Parents do need to know that relative to treatments like medication treatment, to behavior therapy, at this point, the research base is not as extensive,"" Rabiner says.\n\nOn the other hand, Rabiner says, neurofeedback may offer something other treatments can\'t.\n\n""The hope for neurofeedback is that after training ends, the benefits that resulted from training will persist -- that in some sense there\'s been more enduring change in the child\'s ability to focus and attend and to regulate their behavior,"" he says.\n\nBut it will take better research to figure out whether neurofeedback can live up to that promise, Rabiner says.\n\n""There has been a need for some time to have the kind of carefully controlled study that would provide more definitive answers for parents and for the field,"" he says.\n\nResearch In Progress\n\nAnd that research appears to be on the way.\n\nA team at The Ohio State University has nearly completed a pilot study of neurofeedback for ADHD that was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nThe team had hoped to announce results last week at a scientific meeting in New York, but Gene Arnold, one of the scientists in charge of the study, says they had to delay that announcement because ""we weren\'t able to get the results analyzed in time,"" he says.\n\nThe results should be out within a few weeks, Arnold says. In the meantime, he says, the study has shown that it is possible to do neurofeedback research that involves a placebo.\n\nThe study used a video game involving race cars. For kids who got neurofeedback, he says, ""The ability to speed up the car and steer it was contingent on maintaining your brain waves in a more favorable ratio.""\n\nBut other children got a placebo -- a race car that paid no attention to their brain waves.\n\nUntil a large study comes along using this sort of approach, parents and consumers will have to decide for themselves whether neurofeedback is worth the time and effort. Katherine Ellison says that for her and for her son, it was.\n\n""What I noticed in my son was not necessarily that he\'d stop losing things at school or do his homework better,"" she says. ""The improvement I saw was that he was easier to live with.""\n\nBut brain training might not be the only reason, Ellison says. She says it might have been because she and her son spent so much time going to all those sessions together, and had pizza together afterward.']","The story’s premise is that there is “growing evidence” that neurofeedback can help people with ADHD. However, the story never follows up with a description of even a single study which backs up this bold contention. We think a story should always substantiate its primary thesis with at least some detailed reference to the supporting research.","The story did accurately portray the overall state of the evidence on neurofeedback for ADHD and emphasized the lack of well controlled studies supporting its effectiveness. It also provided useful information about how to avoid untrained therapists, and was generally good in its approach to the other criteria that we look at.
In the final analysis, the story applied the healthy skepticism which is a hallmark of good journalism to this topic. But a significant flaw at its core makes this story less useful than it could have been and makes us wonder why it was considered newsworthy, since there is apparently no compelling recent research to discuss. It might have been better to wait for the results of the first placebo-controlled study of neurofeedback for children with ADHD (which the story says will be out in just a few weeks) to be published.

The new treatment pushes powerful magnetic currents into the front of the brain, the part that controls emotions.\n\nThese days, Bruce awakens before her alarm goes off and dives into projects, including monster tasks she once dreaded.\n\n""I have a room in my house in which I had stacked boxes from when we moved 10 years ago that I wanted to get to, but I couldn\'t do it,"" the Centerville woman said. ""But I\'ve been working on that.""\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation, once considered an experimental treatment for depression, is gaining acceptance since it came on the market four years ago. Beginning Saturday, Medicare will cover the treatments when other therapies have failed. This week, specialty insurance administrator Magellan Behavioral Health Inc. issued medical necessity guidelines for TMS treatment and will provide coverage effective Jan. 1.\n\nDoctors who use the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system say treatments are more effective than medications with far fewer side effects. It\'s an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy — shock treatments — for patients who have not responded to drugs or psychotherapy. But TMS is expensive. It can cost as much as $400 for a 37-minute session and require multiple treatments. The total bill can range between $8,000 and $12,000.\n\nThe cost, however, is less than an extended hospital stay.\n\n""We had several patients who were headed toward the hospital, who had this treatment and were able to avoid that,"" said Dr. Scott West, a psychiatrist who pioneered the treatment in Nashville 2 and one-half years ago.\n\nThe NeuroStar system resembles a dentist\'s chair. A patient sits in the chair while a magnetic pulse emitter transmits energy from a levered arm — a process similar to undergoing dental X-rays. The device makes a clicking noise while delivering the magnetic pulses.\n\n""When this large magnet pulses repetitively, it causes an electromagnetic field which then passes through the skull and stimulates the brain tissue itself,"" said West, explaining a cascading effect that results in the interior nerve fibers connecting better.\n\nDr. Michelle Cochran, purchased her TMS system about 18 months ago. The devices cost around $100,000, Cochran said, who has treated 45 patients with the therapy.\n\n""Most people are not scared of it,"" she said. ""It sounds sort of creepy and weird when you think about it, but for the most part, it is safer in general than taking a medicine. You\'ve got less seizure risk than taking a medicine. You\'ve got less side effects than taking a medicine.""\n\nBoth Cochran and West cite high patient response rates. A clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health revealed a ""significant effect of treatment"" when patients received TMS treatment. It compared outcomes of patients who actually received the magnetic pulses against patients in a ""sham"" group, who sat down in the treatment chair for fake sessions.\n\nDepressed patients who received the real TMS treatment had remission rates four times higher than those in the sham group.\n\nHowever, insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, remain reluctant to embrace the treatment. UnitedHealthcare\'s medical policy for TMS says it is unproven for treating depression.\n\n""Generally speaking, just because a device, procedure or medication has been approved or is deemed to be safe by some entities does not mean that it is automatically covered,"" BlueCross BlueShield spokeswoman Kelly Allen said. ""Quality and safety are our first priority in setting our medical policy, but those have to be balanced with affordability.""\n\nCochran does not accept Medicare and has chosen to be an out-of-network provider. West is a Medicare provider.\n\nSaid West: ""Typically, when Medicare starts to cover something the excuse of experimental and investigational is no longer valid.""']","An incomplete and overly optimistic story about a new and potentially useful treatment option.

Three of them found that zinc acetate in daily doses of more than 75 milligrams (mg) shortened colds\' duration by 42 percent, on average.\n\nFive trials using zinc salts other than acetate in daily doses greater than 75 mg shortened colds by an average of 20 percent, while another five using less than 75 mg per day produced no effect.\n\n""Much of the variation in the published study findings can be explained by the daily dose of zinc administered in the zinc lozenges,"" said Hemila, who funded the research himself. ""When focusing on those studies which have used large daily doses of zinc, there is strong evidence that zinc lozenges shorten the duration of colds.""\n\nThe study is published in The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal.\n\nDespite the popularity of zinc supplements, controversy over their effectiveness has continued since a much-publicized 1984 study first suggested a cold-limiting effect. Allowing the lozenge to dissolve instead of swallowing it seemed to provide a therapeutic effect. Since then, more than a dozen studies have been carried out, but data on the trace mineral\'s effectiveness has been mixed.\n\nAll of the trials examined by Hemila compared zinc lozenges to placebos. While surprised to note how strong the correlation was between daily doses of zinc and its effect on colds\' duration, he said he and his colleagues still don\'t know why it seems to work.\n\n""In the evidence-based medicine framework, we are primarily interested in the question whether there is an effect, and how great, whereas the mechanism of the effect is a secondary issue,"" he said.\n\nNo prior studies showed zinc lozenge use -- even up to 150 mg per day -- might cause harm aside from bad taste or constipation, Hemila said, and the most recent trial on zinc acetate indicated no significant differences between zinc and placebo groups in adverse effects even though the daily zinc dose was 92 mg.\n\nDr. Lisa Winston, an epidemiologist at San Francisco General Hospital, praised the study as a ""pretty good synthesis of the data,"" although she noted that the trials Hemila reviewed involved small numbers of participants.\n\n""It\'s an area of controversy and question . . . but I don\'t think the evidence is strong enough, nor do I think the author is suggesting, that we can base clinical practice on it,"" said Winston, also an associate professor in the University of California-San Francisco Department of Medicine. ""I would tell my patients we still don\'t have a cure [for the common cold], and we don\'t know if zinc works.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about the common cold.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Stories about the search for “cures” or even just ways to shorten the span of colds should state that most colds for most people are self-limiting and of short duration.  What is the average duration of this “misery”?

The title and early comments suggest this single retrospective review of existing research gives evidence that larger doses of zinc are effective, but the author of the study says more research is needed. The story’s own independent voice says this is not conclusive at all. Consumers are left without the context to evaluate this latest report.

So a patient who\'s had a prior kidney transplant may be highly sensitized -- meaning they have a large number of the offending antibodies.\n\nIt can also happen to patients who\'ve had blood transfusion or ever been pregnant, Montgomery said.\n\nIt\'s almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. But they might be able to receive a kidney from an incompatible donor if they first undergo an extensive ""desensitization"" process.\n\nThat involves various treatments -- including IV drugs called immune globulin and rituximab -- that try to quash the antibodies that would attack the donor organ.\n\nNow the new research suggests a simple approach -- an infusion of a particular enzyme hours before the transplant -- could offer a better alternative.\n\nResearchers found that the treatment -- dubbed IdeS -- quickly wiped out the dangerous antibodies, allowing all but one of 25 patients to have a successful transplant.\n\nThe findings were published in the Aug. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Funding for the study came from the company developing IdeS -- Hansa Medical.\n\nMontgomery, who was not involved in the study, said he\'s ""never seen anything like it.""\n\n""When you give this, all of the antibodies are gone,"" Montgomery said. ""I\'m hopeful that this will turn out to be a game-changer.""\n\nHowever, he stressed, many questions remain.\n\nCritically, the enzyme does not banish the antibodies forever. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient.\n\nIn the study, 10 patients had an episode of antibody-mediated rejection anywhere from two weeks to five months after their transplant. That means antibodies started to attack the new kidney.\n\nThose patients were all successfully treated with standard anti-rejection drugs, according to the researchers.\n\nStill, it\'s not yet clear how the patients will fare in the long term, said Dr. Julie Ingelfinger, a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nIngelfinger, who wrote an editorial published with the study, echoed Montgomery\'s cautious optimism.\n\nIf larger, longer studies bolster the current findings, she said, ""this could potentially be practice-changing.""\n\n""But,"" Ingelfinger stressed, ""only time will tell.""\n\nLead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary.\n\nBut the findings mark another step forward for patients like these, according to Jordan, who is medical director of the kidney transplant program at Cedars-Sinai, in Los Angeles.\n\nTraditionally, highly sensitized patients in need of a kidney have languished on waiting lists because it\'s so hard to find a compatible donor.\n\nBut in the past 15 years or so, desensitization has emerged as an alternative.\n\nLast year, a landmark study proved that patients who receive transplants after desensitization live significantly longer than those who stay on dialysis.\n\n""The outcomes have been good,"" Jordan said.\n\nBut, he added, there\'s clearly room for improvement.\n\nIngelfinger agreed. ""The desensitization protocols now in use are time-consuming, and they don\'t always work,"" she said, noting that they can leave dangerous antibodies behind.\n\nDesensitization adds about $20,000 to $30,000 to the cost of the transplant, according to the University of Wisconsin\'s transplant center.\n\nThe new approach is quite different, Ingelfinger said.\n\nPatients receive one infusion of an enzyme called IdeS four to six hours before the transplant.\n\nThe enzyme is derived from a strain of Streptococcus bacteria, and it essentially chops up the antibodies that would attack the organ.\n\nJordan acknowledged that the source ""sounds scary,"" but stressed that patients do not receive the bacteria itself -- but an engineered version of the enzyme.\n\nIn all, 25 U.S. and Swedish patients received an infusion of IdeS before their kidney transplant. All but one had a successful transplant, and none had detectable antibodies immediately afterward.\n\nIdeS patients still received additional treatment -- including a week of immune globulin and rituximab infusions.\n\nAnd as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs.\n\nBecause IdeS so readily banishes the offending antibodies, it might make transplants feasible for even the most highly sensitized patients, Montgomery said.\n\nBut the ""$65,000 question"" remains, he said: Can it extend the survival of the donor kidney and, ultimately, patients\' lives?\n\nIdeS is still experimental, and the only way patients could receive it is through a clinical trial. It will be ""a few years"" before it could be more widely available, Montgomery said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Kidney Foundation has more on kidney transplantation.']","The article includes most of the needed cautions, shortcomings and barriers to clinical use of what remains an experimental treatment.","This news article describes a small clinical trial of an enzyme engineered to remove sensitizing antibodies from a patient about to undergo kidney transplantation within a few hours, increasing the chances of transplant success for potentially thousands of patients whose bodies are likely to quickly and forcefully reject a donor organ and for whom it is highly difficult to find a compatible tissue-matched donor. So-called pre-transplant “desensitization” is a strategy that has been around for about 15 years, but the new study involves a one-time, shorter-term, less complex approach than previous efforts.
The article includes most of the needed cautions, shortcomings and barriers to clinical use of what remains an experimental treatment.

Oct. 8, 2018 – The Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC) is now offering deep-tissue external thermal therapy in combination with high-precision proton-beam radiotherapy as a potential way to boost survival chances for certain cancer patients. MPTC is the only center in the world to offer these two treatments at the same facility, an advantage to patients because these therapies are typically given within an hour of each other.\n\nResearch has shown that thermal therapy can be especially useful in difficult-to-reach cancers in the abdomen and pelvic region. Studies have found that adding thermal therapy to standard treatments can significantly shrink tumors and can improve survival for some patients. External thermal therapy, or hyperthermia – in the range of 104° up to 110° F. – sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In addition, heat has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immune response.\n\n“We are very pleased to be able to offer deep-tissue thermal therapy, which can be combined with standard radiation therapy as well as proton-beam therapy to enhance the cancer-killing effects of the radiation,” says Zeljko Vujaskovic, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology and director of the Division of Translational Radiation Sciences (DTRS) in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM).\n\n“Early research suggests that adding thermal therapy to proton-beam therapy may be associated with an even greater benefit than when combined with standard radiation therapy, and we are excited to be at the forefront of making this combination therapy available to cancer patients,” says Dr. Vujaskovic, an internationally recognized expert in hyperthermic oncology.\n\nProton therapy is a precise form of radiation therapy that deposits all of its energy within the tumor and allows for less irradiation of noncancerous tissue. MPTC – which is affiliated with the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC) at the University of Maryland Medical Center – is the only proton treatment center in Maryland.\n\nRadiation oncologists at UMGCCC already use external thermal therapy to treat a range of cancers, but do not currently use it for cancers that are deeper in the body.\n\nAccording to Dr. Vujaskovic, the new deep-tissue thermal therapy equipment, which is made by Pyrexar, will be used to treat cancers of the abdominal and pelvic region, including cancer of the bladder, rectum, cervix, ovaries, pancreas and connective tissue, which are known as sarcomas. Patients would typically receive the thermal therapy two times a week for an hour before or after they receive standard (photon) radiation or proton-beam therapy.\n\nThe system heats the tumor tissue to 108° F. with internal and external probes that enable doctors to continuously monitor the temperature. A water-filled applicator is placed over the area to be treated, and non-invasive radio frequency energy is directed at the tumor. The heat causes the blood vessels in the tumor to dilate, bringing more oxygen into the tumor, which makes cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation therapy.\n\nThe acquisition of the deep-tissue thermal therapy system was made possible by donations from Jack and Emily Howell and the Middendorf Foundation, Inc.\n\n“Within the Department of Radiation Oncology and throughout our cancer center, we strive to make every available tool in the cancer-fighting toolbox available to our patients,” says William F. Regine, MD, FACR, FACRO, the Isadore & Fannie Schneider Foxman Endowed Chair and Professor of radiation oncology at UMSOM and chair of radiation oncology at UMGCCC. “By continuing to develop a comprehensive thermal oncology program, we are giving patients more effective treatment options and therefore another reason to hope for better outcomes.”\n\n“The Maryland Proton Treatment Center has achieved another milestone by becoming the first center to offer both deep-thermal therapy and proton therapy,” says E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs at UM Baltimore and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean at UMSOM. “This achievement is a testament to Dr. Vujaskovic’s considerable expertise in hyperthermic oncology and leadership in developing an outstanding thermal oncology program at the University of Maryland. It’s this type of innovation that sets MPTC apart from other proton treatment centers.”\n\nAbout the University of Maryland School of Medicine\n\nCommemorating its 210th Anniversary, the University of Maryland School of Medicine was chartered in 1807 as the first public medical school in the United States. It continues today as one of the fastest growing, top-tier biomedical research enterprises in the world -- with 43 academic departments, centers, institutes, and programs; and a faculty of more than 3,000 physicians, scientists, and allied health professionals, including members of the National Academy of Sciences, and a distinguished recipient of the Albert E. Lasker Award in Medical Research. With an operating budget of more than $1 billion, the School of Medicine works closely in partnership with the University of Maryland Medical Center and Medical System to provide research-intensive, academic and clinically-based care for more than 1.2 million patients each year. The School has over 2,500 students, residents, and fellows, and nearly $450 million in extramural funding, with more than half of its academic departments ranked in the top 20 among all public medical schools in the nation in research funding. As one of the seven professional schools that make up the University of Maryland, Baltimore campus, the School of Medicine has a total workforce of nearly 7,000 individuals. The combined School and Medical System (“University of Maryland Medicine”) has a total budget of $5 billion and an economic impact of nearly $15 billion on the state and local community. The School of Medicine faculty, which ranks as the 8th-highest public medical school in research productivity, is an innovator in translational medicine with 600 active patents and 24 start-up companies. The School works locally, nationally, and globally, with research and treatment facilities in 36 countries around the world. Visit medschool.umaryland.edu/\n\nAbout the Maryland Proton Treatment Center\n\nThe Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC) offers proton therapy – a highly advanced and precise form of radiation therapy that can increase radiation dose to tumor while decreasing dose to healthy, surrounding tissue – to the Baltimore/Washington region and beyond. It is a highly effective treatment for a wide range of localized tumors such as those found in the brain, base of the skull, head and neck area, eye tumors, tumors of the esophagus, lung, prostate, liver, breast, spinal cord, as well as gastrointestinal malignancies. It is also an important treatment option for children with cancer.\n\nAt MPTC, each treatment room is equipped with the most advanced form of “pencil beam” proton therapy, which essentially paints the radiation onto the tumor while stopping precisely at the site of the tumor. Proton therapy is performed on an outpatient basis and is a well-tolerated, non-invasive treatment that can reduce side effects. It can be used in conjunction with other modalities of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery. MPTC offers a robust clinical trial program to all its patients to further evidence-based medicine.']",The University of Maryland Medical Center is the latest to make an evidence-free claim that its proton beam treatment beats other types of cancer therapies.,"Proton beam therapy has been in vogue for the past few years due to promises to provide more precise radiation therapy, theoretically leading to fewer side effects. A news release from the University of Maryland Medical Center/School of Medicine claims that the center is the only facility in the world to offer both proton beam therapy and thermal therapy, another experimental cancer treatment, in the same facility. 
 As we’ve discussed before, there are few definitive studies proving that proton beam therapy is more effective and safer than conventional cancer treatments. Regardless, hospitals around the country have invested massive amounts of money to be able to provide this treatment, which can lead to large bills for patients. 
The jury is also still out on thermal therapy, also called hyperthermia. The American Cancer Society considers hyperthermia to be an experimental treatment, and notes that it is still being reviewed in clinical trials.

On Thursday, an FDA advisory panel is expected to review Qnexa, made by Vivus, from a combination of phentermine and topiramate. It helped patients in clinical trials lose as much as 13 percent to 15 percent of body weight.\n\nFDA briefing documents posted online Tuesday acknowledged Qnexa\'s effectiveness in helping patients lose weight, but said the review panel should take into account a number of potential nervous system and psychiatric side effects, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe third new drug is Orexigen Therapeutic\'s Contrave, which is a combination of the antidepressant Wellbutrin and the addiction drug naltrexone.\n\nFor the lorcaserin study, Smith\'s team randomly assigned 3,182 obese or overweight people to lorcaserin or placebo. Patients took lorcaserin twice a day for a year and also took part in diet and exercise counseling.\n\nAfter one year, 47.5 percent of those taking lorcaserin had lost 5 percent or more of their body weight. ""That\'s about 20 pounds,"" Smith said.\n\nAmong those taking the placebo, only 20.3 percent had achieved that amount of weight loss, the researchers found.\n\nAfter the first year, people taking lorcaserin were randomized to lorcaserin or placebo for an additional year. Among people who stayed on lorcaserin, 67.9 percent were able to maintain the weight loss they had seen in the first year. Among those who were switched to a placebo, 50.3 percent were able to maintain their weight loss, Smith\'s group reported.\n\nSmith\'s team noted that for those taking lorcaserin, there was no increase in heart valve problems as had been seen with the discredited diet drug Fen-Phen. However, common side effects included headache, dizziness and nausea.\n\nDr. Arne Astrup, from the department of human nutrition at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that ""the trial on lorcaserin provides evidence of a safe weight-loss medication, that seems to provide benefits in terms of reducing risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.""\n\nAlso, it does not have the same problems as the previous weight-loss drugs, Fen-Phen (Phentermine), Acomplia (rimonabant) or Meridia (sibutramine), which had been associated with heart problems, he said.\n\n""If weight-loss drugs are tailor-made to hit only the right receptor, based on physiological knowledge, it seems to be possible to develop weight-loss medications that do not possess any serious adverse effects,"" Astrup added.\n\nHowever, one expert was not sold on this new drug.\n\n""What\'s most impressive about this two-year clinical trial is how unimpressive it is,"" said Dr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nNearly half of the people dropped out in the first year, he pointed out, and by year two, more than half the remainder had also dropped out.\n\n""Among those who remained, lorcaserin produced relatively modest weight loss when combined with diet and exercise counseling, and that weight loss was maintained in over half of the participants only so long as they kept taking the drug. And the paper made no mention of the costs attached to long-term pharmacotherapy,"" Katz added.\n\n""This close look at lorcaserin reaffirms that better daily use of feet and forks holds far greater promise for meaningful, sustainable and affordable weight control than pharmacotherapy,"" Katz said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, lorcaserin will be reviewed by an FDA panel in September, and Contrave will be reviewed in December.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on losing weight, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","This is the best of the three stories reviewed on lorcaserin, but it’s not without flaw.

Yet health-conscious Americans despise them, designing entire diets just to cut them out.\n\nBut out of the pile of cast-off carbs, there are some you should keep. New research around a certain kind of carb, called “resistant starch,” suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight.\n\nWhen we eat refined carbohydrates, like white bread and cookies, our bodies absorb them very quickly, and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells. Eat a lot of them, and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them—which is why we gain weight on high-carb diets.\n\nBut that’s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. These kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine (where most food is digested) and head to the large intestine (also known as the colon) to be metabolized. There, they’re fermented and turned into short-chain fatty acids, which the body burns as energy. Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics—food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThose benefits—getting digested slower, being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria—set resistant starch apart. Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.\n\n“Certain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,” says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. “In my belief, that’s what’s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.”\n\nLuckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.\n\nGetty Images; Illustration by Marisa Gertz for TIME\n\nMost intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. “Cooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,” Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. “The ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,” Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.\n\nIn all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a Nutrition Journal study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant—much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.\n\nGet The Brief.

To Arciero’s surprise, after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein, they experienced an increase in fat burning, compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes. “After you eat a meal that’s principally carbohydrate, the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual,” he says. Adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller, they found—which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight. “If you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg, or whey protein, or pea protein, or chicken or Greek yogurt, that’s a pretty powerful combination,” Arciero says.\n\nIt’s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people lose weight. But the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety. “The potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don’t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,” Arciero says—especially when it’s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.\n\nWrite to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com.""]",This story was a light meal of information that didn’t back up the assertion made in the headline.,"The story describes a single small study of 70 women followed for three hours after a meal containing “resistant starch” and whey protein. We aren’t given any numbers, but the story says that women who received resistant starches and whey protein burned more calories than women fed pancakes without that combination, potentially pointing the way toward future nutrition guidelines or at least more studies.

Alford of the University of Iowa, Iowa City, and colleagues say the results suggest that testing for blood flow disturbances in the lungs may provide an early warning for smokers most likely to develop the disease.\n\nEmphysema is an incurable, progressive lung disease that primarily affects smokers and causes shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Although smoking is by far the most common cause of emphysema, some heavy smokers do not develop the disease for unknown reasons.\n\nRecent research suggests that certain people may be more susceptible to the disease because of differences in how their lung tissue responds to inhaling tobacco.\n\nIn this study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that inhaling tobacco smoke inflamed parts of the lungs and altered blood flow as the smoker's lungs attempted to get oxygen.\n\nResearchers say areas of low blood flow in inflamed lung tissue can promote tissue damage and inhibit repair of damaged tissues, which eventually develops into the symptoms of emphysema.\n\nIn the study, researchers used MDCT scans to measure blood flow differences in 17 nonsmokers and 24 smokers. Based on differences in blood flow, researchers could tell the differences between people who had never smoked, people who smoked and had no signs of emphysema, and people who smoked and had subtle, early signs of emphysema.\n\nBased on the scans, people who had early signs of emphysema had the most disturbed blood flow patterns in otherwise healthy lungs.\n\nIf confirmed by further studies, researchers say this type of testing could help determine who is most at risk of developing emphysema, measure the extent of the disease, and target and test new treatments for the disease.""]","<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"">This story is an example of twisting a piece of basic research in order to create the unfounded impression that it could be clinically useful in the near future.</span>","1clip_filelist.xml""/>



 
This story repeats a vague promise contained in a journal news release that a CT scan could provide smokers with an earlier warning of emphysema risk. The actual research article makes no such claims of clinical usefulness. Indeed, the article and the news from the researcher’s university both emphasize that the point of this work is to offer clues to the underlying mechanism of smoking-related emphysema, to aid research into genetic variations that may be linked to lung disease risk, and to help develop new treatments by identifying and tracking subtle changes in lung blood flow.
Not only does the research itself not discuss providing smokers with warnings, it is not clear how such “warnings” would be more useful than the blanket advice to smokers that they should quit. Indeed, by suggesting the test could identify smokers who are less likely to develop emphysema, it could be that this sort of test would actually make some smoker more complacent, leaving them vulnerable to heart disease, stroke and other tobacco-related harms that are outside the scope of this “test.”
The story also fails to mention that CT scans produce a small, but real, increase in the risk of cancer.

""We cannot sustain this forever.""\n\nHis group on Monday released results of its first-ever head-injury survey of more than 750 member high schools from 2015-2016 sports. It received data from nearly every school.\n\nThe association started the program last fall with 62 high schools. It includes baseline testing of athletes in football and other sports to help with concussion diagnosis.\n\nThe association spent $10,000 last school year to start the program. It expects to spend $30,000 this year but will have fewer schools — 34 — involved because of the expense and commitment. They will also concentrate on sports that have the highest incidence of head injury.\n\n""I hope that we can demonstrate their value and encourage sponsorship, grant support,"" Roberts said. ""But it\'s going to take I think some investment by the people in the communities. The moms and dads are going to have to think that this is important and worth to contributing to make the programs safer for their children.""\n\nHere is some information on what\'s happening in Michigan:\n\nWHAT IS BASELINE TESTING\n\nBaseline testing is a combination of memory, reaction time, attention and stress assessments. It is done in major pro sports because it is considered an objective and individualized tool to help decide whether to remove an athlete from a game. While all states have laws that address preventing concussions in youth sports, many are weak and none require baseline testing.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS\n\nMichigan schools reported 4,452 head injuries in boys and girls sport, or 5.9 per school. Contact sports had the most head injuries. Ranking first was 11-player football with 49 head injuries per 1,000 participants, followed by ice hockey with 38 and 8-player football with 34. Girls soccer had 30 injuries per 1,000 participants, and girls basketball ranked fifth with 29 injuries per 1,000.\n\nBut that is likely only part of the picture. Health and safety advocates fear concussions often go undetected in high schools because of inconsistent protocols at districts unwilling or unable to spend money for detection. It\'s often on players to self-report concussions, or on coaches, who have many responsibilities and sometimes little training, to recognize symptoms.\n\nWHY NOT ALL SCHOOLS\n\nSchools typically don\'t argue with the benefit of testing, but cash-strapped districts often say the cost of offering such programs is prohibitive.\n\nPROGRAMS AVAILABLE\n\nMany sideline concussion-testing programs are on the market. Michigan is testing the Illinois-based King-Devick Test affiliated with the Mayo Clinic and Maryland-based XLNTbrain Sport. The association provides them for free to the participating schools. Long term, Roberts thinks the association could fund it in part with a $3 to $5 fee per student. But the association is also working to get grants.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nBaselines with the XLNTbrain Sport are determined during 30-minute sessions by athletes at computers. The tests measure reaction time, attention, memory and stress by completing a series of exercises that involve such things as word recognition. Athletes suspected of a head injury undergo a sideline assessment done in about five minutes with an iPhone or tablet app. It assesses memory by providing words for the athlete to remember. It asks questions that require the athlete to recall the hit. The athletes also hold the phone as they stand for 20 seconds with eyes open and then closed to check balance. That assessment is compared to the athlete\'s baseline data to help determine whether they can return to play.\n\nWHAT\'S NEXT IN MICHIGAN\n\nRoberts hopes that universities, health care systems and the National Federation of State High School Associations will help analyze the data from last year and this year. The association plans specifically to work with Michigan State University\'s Institute for the Study of Youth Sports to explore possible changes and additions in coaches\' education.\n\n————\n\nFollow Roger Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/rogschneider']","The story does a nice job of summarizing the results of a data collection effort for concussions among athletes, but treats the concept of baseline testing uncritically.","Concussions incurred during sporting events in middle and high schools may have substantial health impacts on young athletes. Recognition of those impacts has grown exponentially in the US, generating earnest efforts to find ways to diagnose possible problems during games, before an athlete returns to the fray and runs the risk of making things worse. A number of companies now market baseline testing products, which usually involve a “baseline” neurological exam at the start of the season. Later, if the athlete is injured during a game, a shorter “sideline” exam can be conducted to compare to the original exam.
This AP story reports on a Michigan-based organization that made baseline testing available to schools in order to gather data over the course of a year about the frequency of potential concussions across ages, genders and type of sport.
The story does a nice job of summarizing the results of that study but treats the concept of baseline testing uncritically. Can the brief sideline diagnostic efforts in the midst of a game actually detect a problem in the making?  It depends on who you “ask.” Baseline testing is currently fashionable in medical circles. The Journal of the American Association (JAMA) has published articles concluding that baseline procedures are valid tests of cognitive function in athletes, a conclusion disputed by articles in other journals. The CDC has a webpage explaining baseline testing that offers details about when to do the tests but with no efficacy critique. And web pages from “The Sports Concussion Institute” tout the testing as evidence-based.
But is it?  We could find no controlled trials showing that neuropsychological testing improves outcomes after sports-related concussions.  And that, in turn, may mean that baseline testing is still a form of expert opinion masquerading as evidence-based science. Since companies are selling baseline testing products, the possibility of industry influence on the conduct of research exists. These details were needed in the to story to present a full picture of what’s at stake.

Newsweek’s coverage points out possible selection bias of study participants,"['An emerging treatment for a common hospital-acquired infection could be (slightly) less gross in the future. Researchers have found that delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in a pill—a poop pill, basically—is no worse than a similar procedure done with a colonoscopy.\n\nNeither option may sound particularly enticing, but FMTs are wildly effective at treating a very nasty infection called Clostridium difficile. One of the first controlled clinical trials for FMTs in 2013 ended early because the patients who received the treatment were doing so much better than patients who didn’t. In the new study, almost 90 percent of adults treated with the capsules were cured.\n\n“It’s absolutely insane. We just don’t see kind of efficacy with drugs,” Dr. Dina Kao told Newsweek. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Kao and her colleagues published the findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nC. difficile infections can set in after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can wipe out some of the bacterial populations normally found in people’s gut. The transplants work by replacing those “healthy” bacteria. “C. difficile is the single biggest cause of diarrhea in a health care setting,” Kao said. “It is our public enemy No. 1 in hospitals.”\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, C. difficile infects half a million people in the United States per year and kills 15,000 people. But patients may be hesitant to accept this potentially life-saving treatment because there are feces involved. Previous research found that while every part of this treatment was unappealing to most people, being offered the treatment in a pill form made patients significantly more open to the idea. Other efforts to take the “poop” out of the poop pills—to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits—have failed.\n\nREUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nThe 116 patients used in this study may have been selected in part because they were ideal candidates for FMTs, Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann noted, but she said the paper is solid overall. (Hohmann, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who has also done research on FMTs, was not involved in his research.) “The results are sort of a best-case scenario,” she said. “What I like about this paper is that it validates the upper-GI route and demonstrates that you can get very good cure rates without doing a colonoscopy.”\n\nThat’s important because colonoscopies and the anesthesia required for the procedure can put a lot of stress on a person’s body and can be complicated for the people most at risk for C. difficile infections, Hohmann noted\n\nKao’s study also showed that people found FMTs far less unpleasant when the poop came in a pill. Two-thirds of the 57 patients who got the pills said their experiences were “not at all unpleasant,” while just 44 percent of the 59 patients who received the FMT via a colonoscopy could say the same.\n\nBut most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.\n\nFMTs are not yet common practice, though Kao noted that it is becoming the standard of care for C. difficile infections. “For this group of patients, nothing else really works,” she said. However, the same cannot be said yet for other conditions. While the FDA said in 2013 that doctors can try fecal transplants in patients with C. difficile infections, the agency noted doctors should only use FMT for other conditions in clinical trials. Over 100 clinical trials are ongoing for various FMT therapies, including ones to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease in children. (New FDA guidelines have been in the works since 2016 but aren’t finalized.)\n\nDespite the FDA’s advice, some people have set up shop as FMT providers anyway. Buzzfeed reported in June that one clinic in Tampa was even providing FMTs as a treatment for autism.\n\nThough physicians think they know how FMTs work, it remains somewhat mysterious. One recent, small study found that even stool samples that are entirely free of bacteria can be effective, perhaps because there are non-bacterial organisms that also help.\n\n“We still don’t understand what’s going on, and in these other conditions it’s not as clear-cut that the disturbance in the bacterial composition is the cause,” Kao said. “Stool is such a complex mixture.”']","However, the story should have avoided using the word “cure” in the headline, since we don’t know the long-term results yet.","This Newsweek story reports on the results of a small study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study compared two methods of delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), via a colonoscopy or with an oral pill, to treat Clostridium difficile infection. An FMT involves taking feces from a healthy person and transplanting it into a sick person, to see if that can help eradicate unwanted microbes.
Both approaches were equally successful and the oral pill — as might be expected — was perceived as less objectionable by patients. The story covers most of the bases we require, though it was unclear on the availability of the pill-based treatment, and what role standard antibiotics play in treatment and research outcomes.

The patients (some of whom had been given a low-dose aspirin regimen, while others were not) were tracked for up to 20 years after.\n\nThe authors determined that while the studies were still underway, overall cancer death risk plummeted by 21 percent among those taking low-dose aspirin. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended.\n\nAt five years out, death due to gastrointestinal cancers had sunk by 54 percent among those patients taking low-dose aspirin.\n\nThe protective impact of low-dose aspirin on stomach and colorectal cancer death was not seen until 10 years out, and for prostate cancer, the benefits first appeared 15 years down the road.\n\nTwenty years after first beginning a low-dose aspirin program, death risk dropped by 10 percent among prostate cancer patients; 30 percent among lung cancer patients (although only those with adenocarcinomas, the type typically seen in nonsmokers); 40 percent among colorectal cancer patients; and 60 percent among esophageal cancer patients.\n\nThe potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases.\n\nThey also found that higher doses of aspirin did not appear to boost the protective benefit. And while neither gender nor smoking history appeared to affect the impact of low-dose aspirin, age definitely did: the 20-year risk of death went down more dramatically among older patients.\n\nAnd while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this ""proof of principle,"" the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most.\n\nDr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as ""very significant.""\n\n""[This] is the largest study to show that people who take aspirin for a long period of time have a reduced risk of death from many cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers,"" he noted.\n\n""The take-home message for patients is that if someone is taking low-dose or regular aspirin, it may put them at a reduced risk of death from cancer,"" Arslan added. ""However, if someone is not already taking aspirin they should talk with their physician before starting. Aspirin has risks of side effects, including bleeding and stroke.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on aspirin, visit the National Institutes of Health.']","This story includes a warning that it’s premature to start taking aspirin to fight cancer, but it doesn’t explain to readers why they should wait for more evidence.","This story says many of the right things about a new study indicating that daily low-dose aspirin appears to lower the risk of death from several common types of cancer. It quotes a researcher who said that the findings should not be viewed as reason for everyone to go out and starting taking aspirin. Unfortunately though, the story never explains to readers why the results might not provide a strong enough foundation for such a recommendation, so the call for restraint lacks sufficient heft when compared with enthusiastic description of benefits which were based entirely on relative risk comparisons. The potential for harm was mentioned only the last line of the story and never quantified. This is particularly worrisome considering that the prevention benefit is not realized for many years. Some of the other stories we reviewed gave more weight to the limitations of the data, included more independent voices and a more thorough discussion of potential harms.

The results, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, demonstrate the first major therapy advance for the condition in nearly 40 years.\n\nFunded by the National Eye Institute (NEI) and conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), the trial compared Lucentis injections with a type of laser therapy called panretinal photocoagulation, which has remained the gold standard for PDR since the mid-1970s. Although laser therapy preserves central vision, it can damage night and side vision, so researchers have sought therapies that lack these side effects.\n\nThe trial results “provide crucial evidence for a safe and effective alternative to laser therapy against PDR,” said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n“Patients who received Lucentis showed a little bit better central vision, much less loss of their side vision, and substantially less risk for surgery than patients who received laser treatment,” said Lloyd Paul Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin Diabetes Center and Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. “These findings will change the available treatment options for patients with PDR.”\n\nDiabetic retinopathy damages blood vessels in the light-sensitive retina in the back of the eye. As the disease worsens, blood vessels can swell and lose their ability to function properly. Diabetic retinopathy becomes proliferative when lack of blood flow in the retina increases production of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can stimulate the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels. These new vessels are prone to bleeding into the center of the eye, sometimes requiring a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy to clear the blood. The abnormal blood vessels can also cause scarring and retinal detachment. Untreated, PDR is associated with high risk of visual loss. Lucentis is among several drugs that block the effects of VEGF.\n\nDr. Aiello and George King, M.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Joslin Diabetes Center and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, pioneered the study of VEGF in diabetic eye disease, beginning in the early 1990s. (Their work followed a distinguished Joslin tradition—the basic laser photocoagulation technique was developed in the 1960s by Dr. Aiello’s father, Lloyd M. Aiello, M.D., and grandfather, William P. Beetham, M.D.)\n\nAbout 7.7 million U.S. residents have diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness among working-age Americans. Among these, about 1.5 percent have progressed to PDR.\n\nThe DRCR.net enrolled 305 participants (394 eyes) with PDR in one or both eyes at 55 clinical sites across the country. Eyes were assigned randomly to treatment with Lucentis or laser. About half of the eyes assigned to the laser group required more than one round of laser treatment. In the other group, Lucentis was injected into the eye once per month for three consecutive months, and then as needed until the disease resolved or stabilized.\n\nBecause Lucentis is commonly injected to treat diabetic macular edema (DME)—a build-up of fluid in the center of the retina—the study permitted the use of Lucentis for DME in the laser group, if necessary. Slightly more than half (53 percent) of eyes in the laser group received Lucentis injections to treat DME. About 6 percent of eyes in the Lucentis group received laser therapy, mostly for issues other than DME.\n\nAt two years, vision in the Lucentis group improved by an average of about half a line on an eye chart, compared with virtually no change in the laser group.\n\nParticipants treated with laser generally lost substantial peripheral vision, but those given injections did not, emphasized Jennifer Sun, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School and physician at the Beetham Eye Institute.\n\n“This was a clear benefit associated with the anti-VEGF medication,” said Dr. Sun, who as the DRCR.net nationwide Protocol Working Investigator was instrumental in the study’s development. “Many of our patients who have laser treatment notice that they have more tunnel vision, which can lead to difficulties as they go about activities of daily life. The use of anti-VEGF treatment rather than laser for PDR could help prevent these symptoms.”\n\nAdditionally, the need for vitrectomy surgery was lower in the Lucentis group (8 of 191 eyes) than in the laser group (30 of 203 eyes).\n\nOverall, the drug’s benefits are particularly clear for people with both PDR and DME. “We know that this drug will help treat both conditions at the same time, so this is an especially appealing treatment alternative for these patients,” Dr. Aiello noted.\n\n“Lucentis should be considered a viable treatment option for people with PDR, especially for individuals needing anti-VEGF for DME,” said Jeffrey G. Gross, M.D., of the Carolina Retina Center in Columbia, South Carolina, who chaired the clinical study.\n\nThe study also suggested that Lucentis may help prevent DME. Among people without this condition at the start of the study, only 9 percent of Lucentis-treated eyes developed it, compared with 28 percent in the laser group. Scientists will follow up on that result as the DRCR.net continues to track patients for a total of five years.\n\nA separate clinical trial, now getting underway, will examine whether anti-VEGF injections given at an earlier stage of diabetic eye disease can help prevent people from developing both DME and the sight-threatening PDR stage of the disease at all, Dr. Aiello said.\n\nThe trial reported today “is a major study that may substantially change our approach to treatment of PDR,” summed up Dr. Sun. “Laser still has a role in the treatment of PDR for some patients, but anti-VEGF therapy gives us another tool in our search for better vision outcomes in our patients with diabetes.”\n\nAbout Joslin Diabetes Center\n\nFounded in 1898, Joslin Diabetes Center is world-renowned for its deep expertise in diabetes treatment and research.

Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in other types of lung cancer, and now we’re seeing encouraging improvements in advanced squamous lung cancer, which historically has been very difficult to treat,” said ASCO Expert David Graham, MD, FASCO.\n\nCHICAGO – Initial findings from a randomized phase III clinical trial show that patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) benefit more from initial treatment with PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) and chemotherapy than from chemotherapy alone -- 29% had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. At 12 months, cancer had not worsened in twice as many patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy compared to those who only received chemotherapy. This benefit was observed across all PD-L1 expressing sub-groups.\n\nThe findings will be featured in a press briefing today and presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.\n\n“Until now, there have been few treatment advances for squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Our findings may provide a new potential treatment option for this type of cancer,” said lead study author Robert M. Jotte, MD, PhD, Medical Director and Co-Chair, USON Thoracic Committee, Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers in Denver, CO. “We used to think that chemotherapy just knocked down the patient’s immune system and that it would be irrational to combine it with immunotherapy, but growing research, including this study, shows that chemotherapy can help trigger the immune response to the tumor, helping the immunotherapy treatment work better.”\n\nSquamous NSCLC, which accounts for 25-30% of NSCLCs, is very difficult to treat. Fewer than 15% of people with advanced squamous NSCLC survive a year after diagnosis, and less than 2% survive five years.\n\nRecent studies have also found a benefit of combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy in non-squamous lung cancer. Given those findings, along with the results from this trial, a rapid change in clinical practice is expected, noted Dr. Jotte.\n\nAbout the Study\n\nThe IMpower131 trial enrolled 1,021 patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC. Tumors were tested for PD-L1 expression, but patients were included in the trial regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression level. Patients with EGFR or ALK gene changes in the tumor received targeted treatments before starting therapy on this trial. The study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Outcomes for only two of the groups, however, are being reported in this presentation:\n\nAtezolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel), 343 patients\n\nChemotherapy (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel), 340 patients\n\nOutcome data for the third treatment group, which received atezolizumab with a slightly different chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin and paclitaxel), are not yet available.\n\nKey Findings\n\nIn this study, 29% of all patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression, had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death, compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. Importantly, there was a doubling of progression-free survival (PFS) benefit with this combination: at 12 months, cancer had not worsened in 24.7% patients receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy, compared to 12% of those receiving chemotherapy alone.\n\nImproved progression-free survival was observed in all groups of patients who received immunotherapy and chemotherapy, including those with PD-L1-negative tumors and liver metastases. Overall survival data are not yet mature.\n\nThis is the first phase III trial of an immunotherapy-based combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progression-free survival in advanced squamous NSCLC, according to the authors. Although the difference between treatment groups is modest, a statistically significant improvement shows that, overall, people with advanced squamous lung cancer can benefit when immunotherapy is added to standard treatment, according to the authors.\n\nAlthough the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone (68% vs. 57%), it had a manageable safety profile, consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies. The most common side effects of atezolizumab included skin rash, colitis, and low thyroid hormone.\n\nAt this interim analysis a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit was not observed (median OS was 14 months for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 13.9 months for chemotherapy alone). Researchers are continuing to follow patients and anticipate a subsequent analysis later this year.\n\nNext Steps\n\nMore research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy. The researchers will explore tumor PD-L1 expression and other molecular markers, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), that may predict whether a patient will benefit from this treatment regimen.\n\nThis study received funding from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.\n\nStudy at a Glance\n\nDisease Squamous NSCLC Trial Phase, Type Phase III, Randomized, Global (27 countries) Multicenter (317) Patients on Trial 1,021 all-comer (PD-L1 unselected), chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC Intervention Tested Atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone Primary Finding mPFS 6.3 months with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 5.6 months with chemotherapy alone Secondary Finding(s) 12-month PFS 24.7% with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 12% with chemotherapy alone\n\nView the full abstract.\n\nFor your readers:\n\nView the disclosures for the 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting News Planning Team.\n\nATTRIBUTION TO THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY ANNUAL MEETING IS REQUESTED IN ALL COVERAGE.\n\n###']","While researchers saw slightly slower cancer growth, patients receiving immunotherapy on average felt worse, while not living any longer.","This release about the addition of an immunotherapy drug (atezolizumab, brand name Tecentriq) to chemotherapy for patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer is an exercise in highlighting the most favorable interpretation of trial results that overall showed no survival difference, while burdening patients with higher rates of severe or life-threatening side effects.
The release and an abstract presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting put the spotlight on a 29% “reduced risk of disease worsening or death”… while acknowledging only in the final sentence that there was no evidence of improved overall survival. What’s more, while the release refers to “disease worsening,” what the trial actually measured was “investigator (INV) assessed PFS”, that is, progression-free survival as determined by the researchers, which is not the same as “disease worsening” as reported by patients. Because the release was distributed in the same document with the research abstract, we gave it credit for including information (notably extensive disclosures, along with detailed results) that were not included in the body of the release itself.

Half of the group was assigned to naltrexone and the other half to bupenorphine.\n\nSix percent of those enlisted to use buprenorphine were unable to start their treatment, whereas 28% of those assigned to naltrexone dropped out before starting the therapy.\n\nThat hurdle is attributed to the fact that in order to start naltrexone, a person has to have detoxed or not used opioids for several days, whereas a user can transition from opioids to buprenorphine seamlessly. ""If you\'re currently opiate-dependent ... (naltrexone) takes more work,"" said Dr. Joshua Lee , the lead author of the study, who studies opioid addiction behavior and treatment at New York University.\n\nOnce on either of the medications, people fared equally well. ""They tend to stay on medications about the same rate. They report good outcomes, avoiding heroin use,"" Lee said. However, both groups also reported similar challenges staying with the regimens: Just 40% of patients still used the drugs after 24 weeks.\n\nWhat was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn\'t one-size-fits-all. ""Much like you would expect if the doctor told you \'you have cancer\' or \'you have diabetes,\' then there are different ways you could pursue treatment,"" he said.\n\nThe gold standard of addiction treatment\n\nPublic health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. It combines medication with counseling to help addicts wean off of high opioid use. Public health experts say it can help solve the staggering opioid overdose epidemic.\n\nThis year alone, the CDC estimates that more than 64,000 people have died of drug overdoses, most of them from opioids -- more than the number of American troops lost during the entire Vietnam War . Studies have found that using medicated-assisted treatments can reduce overdose mortality by half.\n\nMethadone may be the best-known form of medicated-assisted treatment, but it requires patients to have the drug administered daily in a clinic. Two other options have become increasingly popular: buprenorphine, which can be taken outside a clinic, and naltrexone, which is administered monthly.\n\nNaltrexone has become become an increasingly popular choice among drug courts . Some say that\'s because of the once-a-month administration, and others say it\'s because it requires that users completely detox before starting the regimen.\n\nUnderstanding addiction\n\n""People need choices,"" said Caleb Banta-Green, a professor at the University of Washington\'s School of Public Health. Banta-Green, who was not involved in the new study, said that getting the right treatment means understanding addiction from a psychological as well as biological perspective.\n\nLegally prescribed opioid drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone work in the same manner as illicit drugs like heroin. They all chemically bind to the opioid receptors in the brain to help dull pain and, in some people, provide euphoria.\n\nThe body also produces natural opioids, but the more narcotics a person takes, the less opioids the body naturally produces. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency.\n\n""To feel normal, they need opiates on those receptors,"" Banta-Green said. Buprenorphine and methadone, which are opioids, work by reducing people\'s cravings. ""They bind to prevent withdrawal, giving some opiate effect,"" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, naltrexone works by chemically blocking those receptors, which is why someone needs to detox before starting the regimen. ""You\'re not getting an opiate effect,"" Banta-Green explained.\n\nIf a person takes an opioid while on naltrexone, it is unlikely they will feel any opioid sensation. If a person is using opioids and takes naltrexone, it can induce a feeling of withdrawal. ""It addresses craving in a different way. The person knows they can\'t use,"" he said.\n\nSo, for example, a person who is actively using opioids and can\'t manage the withdrawals may be better suited for buprenorphine, while someone coming from a facility where he or she has detoxed and who doesn\'t want to use opioids may be better suited for naltrexone.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhat is key, said Dr. Miriam Komaromy, is meeting a patient where they are and understanding what best meets their needs.\n\nAddiction ""is an incredibly deadly disease,"" said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. And as public policymakers, prisons and drug courts play a larger role in treating addiction, public health experts like Komaromy argue that it is imperative to look at ""evidence-based ways instead of having a moralistic view.""\n\nBanta-Green says he talks to a lot of judges who are trying to understand addiction treatment. ""I say this a lot to judges: You can\'t just offer one medication. Just like any other medication, some people are going to feel right with one as opposed to the other.""']",But more needed to be said about the potential harms of the treatments–which carry risks–as well as their general availability and cost.,"Stemming disability and deaths from opioid use disorder is a major public health challenge, and medication has become the treatment of choice to help people with addiction. The study reported in this CNN story compares two available drugs—buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) and naltrexone (Vivitrol)—that can blunt or block cravings and reduce illicit opioid use.
The clinical study found that people with opioid use disorder were far more likely to begin taking one (Suboxone) than the other (Vivitrol), principally because Vivitrol requires patients to have first gone through detoxification. That’s an important difference, the article notes, as effectiveness is more likely if a physician can choose a drug that fits her patient’s circumstances. The story does a nice job of making this point, although it gives less attention to another sobering pattern unearthed by the study: Among the subjects who started the drugs, fewer than half were still taking them six months later. Also, more needed to be said about the potential harms of the medications–both carry risks–as well as their general availability and cost.
We wanted to point out two things with the story that don’t fall within the realm of our review criteria:

It may have a big impact on public health without requiring complicated counting of calories or nutrients.”\n\nWomen who fasted for longer periods of time overnight had significantly better control over blood glucose concentrations. The data shows that each three hour increase in nighttime fasting was associated with a 4 percent lower postprandial glucose level, regardless of how much women ate.\n\n“The dietary advice for cancer prevention usually focuses on limiting consumption of red meat, alcohol and refined grains while increasing plant-based foods,” said co-author Ruth Patterson, PhD, UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center associate director for population sciences and program leader of the cancer prevention program. “New evidence suggests that when and how often people eat can also play a role in cancer risk.”\n\nWomen in the study reported eating five times per day with a mean nighttime fasting of 12 hours. Those who reported longer fast durations also indicated they consumed fewer calories per day, ate fewer calories after 10 p.m. and had fewer eating episodes.\n\nResearchers recommend large-scale clinical trials to confirm that nighttime fasting results in favorable changes to biomarkers of glycemic control and breast cancer risk.\n\nCo-authors include Loki Natarajan, Dorothy Sears and Sheri Hartman of UC San Diego; and Linda Gallo and Elva Arredondo of San Diego State University.\n\nFunding for this research came, in part, from the National Cancer Institute-sponsored Ruth L.

But the release does not show any data to support even an association. It appears the study merely hypothesized that the benefits of fasting may be associated with breast cancer reduction, but this hypothesis was not directly tested by the researchers. The release provides no evidence that the researchers looked at actual breast cancer risk in the subjects.

Estrogen stimulates the growth of ER+ tumors.\n\nThe women were classified into three groups as the study began: ""marginal"", meaning that the women were eligible for a lumpectomy to conserve the breast, but that it would be disfiguring or require several operations; ""mastectomy-only"", meaning a lumpectomy was not considered possible; and ""inoperable"", meaning that doctors believed that even a mastectomy would not completely remove the cancer.\n\nAfter the four months of estrogen-lowering therapy, the research team found that 82 percent of those women in the marginal group were, in fact, able to undergo successful breast-conservation surgery.\n\nMore than half of those women who had been categorized as mastectomy-only patients were also able to go the lumpectomy route and experience a good outcome. And 75 percent of those thought to be inoperable altogether were able to have breast-conservation surgery.\n\nThe investigation was funded by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and led by Dr. Julie A. Margenthaler, an assistant professor of surgery and a breast surgeon at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n""Aromatase inhibitor therapy shrank the tumors in many of these women and improved surgical outcomes,"" study chair Dr. Matthey J. Ellis, a breast cancer specialist at Washington University and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, said in a news release. ""These results will encourage a change in practice across the country so that more women can benefit from the currently underutilized approach of administering estrogen-lowering agents before surgery.""\n\nThe findings are scheduled to be presented June 7 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, in Chicago.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on surgical options for breast cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']",HealthDay seems to have outsourced this story to a publicity team from either the American Society of Clinical Oncology or a St. Louis medical center where the research in question is from.  Journalism? ,"The story has the same basic content and quotes as this press release put out by the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University four days before the HealthDay piece.

Treatment combination shows early promise,"['Philadelphia, PA, April 18, 2017 - In the past, all forms of metastatic prostate cancer have been considered incurable. In recent years, the FDA has approved six drugs for men with metastatic disease, all of which can increase survival. In a study published in Urology®, researchers demonstrate for the first time that an aggressive combination of systemic therapy (drug treatment) with local therapy (surgery and radiation) directed at both the primary tumor and metastasis can eliminate all detectable disease in selected patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nWhile the study is only a first step, one-fifth of the patients treated had no detectable disease, with an undetectable prostate-specific-androgen (PSA) and normal blood testosterone, after 20 months. The results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured; investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate). Such results could not have been achieved with any single therapy alone.\n\nAccording to lead investigator Howard I. Scher, MD, Chief of the Genitourinary Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, ""The sequential use of the three different modalities helped illustrate the role and importance of each in achieving the undetectable PSA with normal testosterone level end point, which represents a \'no-evidence of disease\' status."" Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured.\n\nTwenty men with metastatic prostate cancer, five with extra-pelvic lymph nodal disease and 15 with bone with or without nodal disease, were treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), radical surgery that included a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection as needed, and radiation therapy to visible metastatic lesions in bone. ADT was stopped after a minimum of six months if an undetectable PSA was achieved after combined modality therapy. Other patients were treated continuously.\n\nThe combined treatment regimen including surgery was well tolerated. Matthew J. O\'Shaughnessy, MD, PhD, Urology Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, commented ""While the role of local therapy in metastatic prostate cancer is still under investigation, aggressive resection of visible disease performed by experienced surgeons was critical to the outcome.""\n\nOf the five patients with extra-pelvic lymph node involvement, four achieved an undetectable PSA after ADT and surgery, while the fifth needed radiation to reach this milestone. However, none achieved the primary end point of undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery at 20 months after initiation of therapy with ADT alone, although one patient had a PSA of <.05 ng/mL with a testosterone level of 47 ng/dL at 39 months.\n\nOf the 15 patients with bone metastases, 14 (93%) reached an undetectable PSA when ADT, surgery, and radiation were used. Ultimately, four (27%) achieved the proposed end point, a PSA of <.05 ng/mL and serum testosterone of >150 ng/dL at 20 months after the start of ADT, which remained undetectable in two patients for 27 and 46 months, respectively.\n\nCommenting on the study, Oliver Sartor, MD, Cancer Research, Department of Medicine and Urology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, stated, ""The end point deserves special mention, as the end point of undetectable PSA after testosterone recovery has been previously discussed but rarely studied. The authors proposed that this end point may serve as a first step toward establishing a curative paradigm. Many in the field agree, but note that the longevity of effect is essential to prove the point of curability. Regardless, the movement toward a curative paradigm is much needed and the investigators are to be congratulated for setting forth a paradigm that can be used to assess the possibility of cure in a reasonable period of time.""\n\n""A multimodal treatment strategy for patients who present with disease that is beyond the limits of curability by any single modality enables the evaluation of new approaches in order to prioritize large-scale testing in early stages of advanced disease. The end point also shifts the paradigm from palliation to cure,"" remarked Dr. Scher. It is expected that an upcoming Phase 2 trial will further test this endpoint and combined modality approach.\n\n###']",This release on a small study does not provide enough data to show that the three-pronged treatment studied can “cure” prostate cancer.,"A study in 20 men.  “Cure” in the news release headline.  Talk of a new paradigm after just a Phase I trial.
These were just some of the issues that jumped out at our reviewers from this news release about a study published in the journal Urology. The study evaluated treatment of 20 men with prostate cancer that had metastasized, or spread to other parts of the body.
All of the patients received a combination of pharmaceutical, surgical and radiation treatment with the end goal of having no detectable prostate cancer after 20 months.
The release did an adequate job in describing the study’s novelty and the availability of the different treatment options.
But the headline and opening paragraphs of the release frame the research as a potential “cure” for metastatic prostate cancer, despite concerns, that the release itself notes, about the fact that this is a small, preliminary study in which cancer ultimately appears to have recurred for all of the “successful” patients. Lastly, the release notes that the design of the study allowed researchers to identify which combination of treatments was most effective at eliminating detectable disease.

She recalls looking one of the physicians in the eye, defiant. “I’m done with this shit,” she remembers saying. “I’m done with you guys bullying us.”\n\nThen, she took out a bag and dumped the contents on the table: nine months of cancer drugs prescribed to her son, Landon, who was 4 at the time. He had been diagnosed more than a year before with an aggressive form of leukemia and undergone months of grueling treatment. But his mother was now refusing to follow his doctors’ orders. “Listen: Here’s all this chemo you told CPS he cannot live without, and if I didn’t give it to him, he would relapse and die.”\n\nTech & Science Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek Tech & Science delivered to your inbox\n\nBut Landon, who underwent only one year of cancer treatment instead of the recommended four, was still alive—thriving, in fact—even though he’d stopped taking that massive pile of drugs prescribed for him. That’s why his mother had called this meeting. She implored the CPS director—whom by then she knew by first name—to restrain the oncologists who had threatened to take her child away and put him in foster care. Riddle believes the doctors wanted to prove she was a neglectful, abusive mother, but she knew she could convince the world that the hospital was wrong about her son’s treatment. (Due to HIPAA patient privacy laws, Children’s Hospital Colorado was unable to comment on Landon’s case for this story.)\n\nLandon’s cancer, diagnosed in September 2012, had put Riddle in a situation that’s any parent’s worst nightmare: She had to watch him undergo lifesaving treatment that appeared to be killing him. Riddle says she was left with no choice but to defy his doctors’ orders.\n\nRELATED: What we know about how cancer starts could all be wrong\n\nIn January 2013, nearly four months after Landon’s initial diagnosis, the two went from Utah to Colorado, where Riddle purchased an alternative treatment fraught with complicated politics and plenty of skepticism—especially when it comes to saving the life of a preschooler with a potentially fatal disease. At the time, Colorado was one of only about a dozen states in the U.S. that had legalized medical cannabis. It also allowed sick children to access the drug under professional guidance. Landon became the youngest patient in the U.S. at that time to receive a medical marijuana card. Riddle’s decision to treat her child with cannabis landed the family in the center of a contentious national debate, as well as on prime-time television with CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta. In Utah, all cannabis is illegal, so when their story went public, she and Landon had to move permanently to Colorado, so he could continue to have access to the drug. Even now, at 7, he still needs to take cannabis to cope with the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation, she says.\n\nBy the time of that showdown with CPS and Landon’s doctors in Denver, Riddle had stopped giving her son all of the drugs prescribed by the hospital: the chemo, opiates and benzos. The latter two—which included OxyContin, morphine and Ativan—were prescribed to help Landon cope with the side effects of cancer treatment. None of them helped, she says, or they made him feel worse. But when Landon started the cannabis oil, his health miraculously improved. She was willing to do whatever it took to keep him on cannabis.\n\nA Key in the Lock\n\nAs laws that permit medical cannabis have expanded nationwide (29 states in the country now permit some form of cannabis use for medical purposes), cancer patients increasingly use the drug to alleviate the harsh symptoms of chemotherapy, such as nausea, anxiety, loss of appetite and insomnia. But there’s also an emerging body of research that suggests marijuana might be effective as a treatment for cancer on its own, or in conjunction with standard therapies.\n\nWhen Riddle made the decision to give her son cannabis, the information on its safety and efficacy was (and still is) limited to anecdotal accounts, a handful of case reports and lab studies published in obscure medical journals. Initially, her hope was that the drug would lessen the side effects. But Riddle soon heard that certain compounds in cannabis—cannabinoids—have been shown to induce cancer cell death. The theory seemed to be especially promising for leukemia, at least according to studies done on cancer cells in test tubes and on mice injected with human leukemia cells. But at that point there wasn’t any evidence it would work for humans. There still isn’t. While cannabis is legal in many U.S. states, the drug is still classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule 1 narcotic (along with heroin and cocaine), which make it very difficult for scientists to conduct clinical trials on people. However, that may change as other nations, such as Israel, take the lead and fund marijuana research.\n\nRyan David Brown for Newsweek\n\nThe findings so far from published lab studies suggest cannabidiol (CBD), one of more than 100 cannabinoids present in the plant, targets certain pathways in leukemia. The evidence indicates that leukemia cells have a high number of cannabinoid receptors—primarily the receptor CB2. The proteins on the cell membrane (receptors) recognize the chemical compound, CBD. The shape of the receptor mirrors the shape of the compound, enabling the CBD to land and attach to the cell. “It’s like a key in the lock,” says Dr. Bonni Goldstein, medical director of Canna-Centers in Los Angeles and the medical adviser to Weedmaps.com, a resource for people seeking specialists to oversee their medical cannabis treatment. “When compounds such as cannabidiol bond to receptors, it causes the cell to die.”\n\nFurther studies are needed to verify that CBD could potentially kill leukemia, says Robert McKallip, an associate professor of immunology at Mercer University School of Medicine, who conducted some of the earliest research on the anti-leukemia properties of compounds found in cannabis. McKallip suggests cannabis could be used along with other treatments for leukemia. “Combined with other targeted therapies, which again, specifically target the leukemia, you give it a one-two punch and hopefully reduce side effects and improve efficacy of treatment,” he says.\n\nRiddle isn’t a doctor, but she theorizes that while the chemo initially cleared Landon’s cancer, it’s the cannabis that has kept his disease from coming back. Oncologists who treat pediatric patients often tell families that when the five-year mark passes, their child is in the clear. It’s been nearly five years since Riddle sat in that conference room meeting; Landon is still cancer-free. Riddle says that once he hits the five-year mark this fall, he’ll set a precedent for pediatric leukemia patients in the U.S., and maybe even worldwide.\n\n‘He’s Dying’\n\nRiddle, a single mother, was willing to do whatever it would take to rid Landon of the cancer in his blood that had spread to his brain and formed a tumor in his chest the size of a large grapefruit. She desperately wanted to trust the doctors at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, where her son was diagnosed at age 2, and who admitted to her that they weren’t sure they could save his life.\n\nShe knew the leukemia treatment protocols are backed by decades of research. But they are infamously rough for a child and drag on for years. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what’s known as “remission reduction.” After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring—called “consolidation”—to make sure his body wasn’t harboring leukemia cells.\n\nThis aggressive approach is one of the main reasons pediatric leukemia, depending on its more specific classification, has at least an 80 to 90 percent survival rate. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society estimates that nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed in the U.S. with some form of leukemia in 2017. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. Riddle hoped the same would be true for her son. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating. The chemo caused him to vomit up to 50 times a day, which made it difficult for him to speak because his esophagus was burned and closed up. The chemo had compromised his immune system so severely that he caught every bug in the hospital, just about every strain of stomach viruses, influenza and the common cold. He eventually developed numbness, tingling, pain and weakness (neuropathy) in his feet and ankles, and was no longer able to walk.\n\nWithin the first 90 days of treatment, Landon lost half his body weight. He stopped eating for more than a month. He needed blood and platelet transfusions. Doctors kept adding prescription after prescription to alleviate the side effects of treatment—narcotics, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs, prescriptions for pain. “The sad thing is they didn’t seem to help Landon,” she says. “At this point, they kept telling us we have to keep going. I said, ‘He’s dying. It’s very apparent that he’s dying.’”\n\nLandon began to refuse chemotherapy and turn into a “little psychopath,” says Riddle. He kicked and screamed when nurses forced pills into his mouth, so eventually everything needed to be administered with an IV. “The chemo actually has healed a lot of kids, but it almost killed me,” he says.\n\nRyan David Brown for Newsweek\n\nMost children with leukemia go into remission within the first 30 days of treatment, which was why Landon’s doctors insisted on several more years of chemotherapy, says Riddle. By the time Landon was nearing the end of his first stage of treatment, Riddle says her son was on the brink of death. The doctors told her to bring him home for a two-week break from chemo, adding that they would arrange to send a hospice nurse—an ominous hint that Landon was about to die.\n\nA plea for help posted on Facebook by Riddle’s mother, Wendy, led the family to a group of brothers in Denver, the Stanleys, who were cultivating cannabis for medicinal purposes and had made the news for a strain they called Charlotte’s Web. Riddle and her mother had seen the story about Charlotte Figi, a 6-year-old girl with Dravet syndrome, a rare type of epilepsy that was unresponsive to standard treatment. She had up to 300 seizures per day. But the seizures stopped when she began taking CBD oil supplied by the brothers.\n\nThe Stanleys visited the Riddles in Utah to educate them about Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)—the psychoactive chemical in the plant—and CBD. She decided to start Landon on cannabis. But to do that, the family would need to leave Utah, where all cannabis is illegal. So Riddle and Landon moved in with the brothers for about a year, says Joel Stanley, the CEO of the company that is now known as CW Hemp. “It was just so sad to see someone that young and that small going through such harsh treatment,” Stanley says of Landon. “He also had elements of what I know a lot of folks would call ‘chemo brain.’ He would get very frustrated and very angry, all normal because his little body was just being invaded by this intense medication and rounds of chemotherapy treatment.” Throughout that year, Riddle and her son traveled back and forth from Colorado to Utah, so he could continue chemo, but this time with the aid of cannabis, to make treatment more bearable. That meant Riddle had the drug on hand, and Landon was under its influence while in Utah, which made mother and son both felons.\n\nRELATED: Personalized cancer vaccines edge closer after success in human clinical trials\n\nNearly all of the children the brothers had worked with by then were refractory epilepsy patients. The Stanleys had gotten their start a few years before with adults who wanted to manage cancer, and Landon was their first pediatric cancer patient.\n\nRiddle began her son on Charlotte’s Web CBD oil and eventually added THC. As Riddle titrated the THC dosing, she slowly weaned her son off the narcotics prescribed for him by his doctors in Utah. Stanley says the combination of CBD oil and THC helped Landon deal with the side effects of chemotherapy and, based on limited existing lab research, made it more likely that the cannabis could kill the cancer as well. “If the cannabinoids do in his body what they have proven to do in petri dishes and in mice, why not throw the book at them?”\n\nRyan David Brown for Newsweek\n\nBy then, CNN had started to follow Landon’s story. The network planned to broadcast the segment after he and his mother had returned to Utah, packed up their car with their possessions and drove to their new home in Colorado, where Landon could continue to take cannabis. But CNN aired a promotion for the premiere of the episode before they had left for Colorado. The oncologist at the hospital in Utah who oversaw Landon’s treatment granted them discharge anyway and told Riddle she better leave the state immediately.\n\nRiddle says she was shocked to find that the doctors at the children’s hospital in Denver weren’t on her side. She says the hospital called CPS on her more than a dozen times when it became aware that she was no longer complying with treatment.\n\nThat is why she ended up in that conference room with a cannabis researcher, who was there to explain why the drug could help patients like Landon. He was the only person in the medical field she could find who would speak on her behalf. “It was a big slap in the face that not a single doctor would come forward to help us,” she says. “They were all afraid of losing their medical license. They were afraid of the government. They were afraid of what it would look like if they came forward in the name of cannabis.”\n\nIn the end, CPS supported Riddle. Results from blood tests, a bone marrow biopsy and spinal tap proved Landon no longer had leukemia, not even the microscopic kind, she says. Riddle says the CPS director called the hospital and ordered it to have Landon’s chemo port removed and discharge him from the hospital.\n\nToday, Landon is still coping with the impact of his treatment. In addition to digestive problems, he has post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. The cannabis vape pen helps with that, says Riddle. She says the cranial radiation he had to endure caused some neurological deficits, and Landon says he worries that he’ll be sick forever.\n\nBut there’s so much good news here. He’s alive, and he and his mother are no longer just “medical marijuana refugees.” They’re also activists. Along with other parents, she helped draft a bill and pass a state law that allows Landon and other children like him with chronic illnesses to take cannabis at school. (Since the drug is federally illegal, it had been illegal at school. That’s no longer the case in Colorado.)\n\nThey’ve testified in California on behalf of a medical marijuana caregiver whose home was raided by the federal government, helping the man avoid a 35-year jail sentence. The mother and son have also traveled back to Utah to appear at a state congressional hearing for a medical marijuana bill that’s been shot down twice, which means they won’t be going home anytime soon.\n\nAt public appearances, Riddle does most of the talking, but she says as Landon has grown up, he has become more aware of his health problems stemming from his cancer treatment. And also angrier. “Eventually, he’ll be the one telling the story, and I’ll just be the one supporting him.”']","This story leaned in the direction of anecdote-over-evidence, but only slightly.","We commend this story for making it clear that there is scanty evidence to support cannabis oil as a primary cancer treatment. Nevertheless, many readers will get the impression that the oil was responsible for the patient’s cancer remission and improvement in quality of life. The story could have more clearly pointed out that this child’s improved health might have simply been a consequence of receiving the standard treatment when he was first diagnosed.
We also take issue with the headline. It’s misleading and irresponsible to propose to parents of children with harrowing illnesses that medical marijuana is “the answer” to cancer. As the story explains, we’re nowhere near knowing if this is the case–or not.

Expert notes it will probably only be effective for short-term weight loss,"['En Español\n\nBy Dennis Thompson\n\nHealthDay Reporter\n\nWEDNESDAY, July 29, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\'s approval of a temporary, implanted balloon device for weight loss may have many wondering how -- and how well -- it works.\n\nCalled the ReShape Integrated Dual Balloon System, the device consists of two connected balloons filled with saline. The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday.\n\nBut the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n""It\'s going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,"" Roslin said, ""but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity.""\n\n""I don\'t think it\'s going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,"" he added. ""I think it\'s going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly.""\n\nIn a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston.\n\nThe device is available to obese people who often don\'t qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nIt\'s also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said.\n\nDoctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system.\n\nThe device doesn\'t change the stomach\'s natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed.\n\nA pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained.\n\nWith ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient\'s urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device.\n\nNausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce.\n\n""The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,"" Roslin said.\n\nAnother troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial.\n\nRoslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. ""It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,"" he said.\n\nThe balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California.\n\nThe people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said.\n\nIn the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight -- just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on how being overweight or obese affects your health, visit the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.']","This was a reasonably thorough report on a temporary implantable weight loss balloon procedure.  But the intervention raises all sorts of questions about the role of a temporary device, with limited benefits and known harms, for a non-medically necessary procedure.  And the story didn’t address that broader picture. Maybe a followup is in order.","This story describes a device, ReShape, inserted inside the patient’s stomach that appears to help with weight loss on a short-term temporary basis. Besides the gastric ulcers that struck more than one-third of patients in the study group, we think this device also may also represent a “harm” if it encourages patients down a short-term path rather then helping them make a long-term permanent change in their health. The small study described was financed by the device manufacturer.

Like every new study of prostate cancer, the results need to be carefully parsed.\n\nFirst, the study results, which appear in this week\'s New England Journal of Medicine. It\'s actually an update of a 2008 report, with an additional three years of data on the nearly 700 men who volunteered for the trial up to 15 years ago. All of them had early-stage prostate cancer at the beginning.\n\nThe study found 38 percent fewer prostate cancer deaths among men randomly assigned to the surgery group versus those in what the Swedes called the watchful-waiting group. Men who had surgery had 41 percent lower risk of their cancer spreading throughout the body, and 66 percent less risk of growth within the prostate.\n\nThe survival benefits were restricted to men under 65. For this group, surgery saved one life for every seven men who had prostatectomies — considered a favorable ratio. And it applied to men with tumors considered low-risk, meaning they have a relatively low Gleason score, a marker of tumor aggressiveness.\n\n""Our findings show that some tumors that are considered to be low-risk at diagnosis do pose a threat to life, especially if they are not surgically removed,"" the study authors write.\n\nSo is this a slam-dunk for radical prostatectomy? Game over?\n\nFar from it. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Dr. Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Hospital makes some important points.\n\nFirst, only about 1 in 20 men in the Swedish study had a prostate cancer diagnosis based on a high PSA level. Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. But in the U.S., most prostate cancers are identified by PSA screening, and less than half have palpable tumors.\n\nThis is important, because experts believe many prostate tumors found by PSA are likely to be slow-growing — perhaps so slow they will never cause a problem before the man dies of something else.\n\nSo ""low risk"" in the Swedish study means higher-risk than the current ""low risk"" men diagnosed in the United States.

If there\'s a sign the cancer is progressing, doctors currently would treat with intent to cure, using surgery, radiation or both.\n\nSmith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there\'s reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the ""watchful waiting"" group in the newly published study.\n\nUnfortunately, there haven\'t been any large studies in which prostatectomy and radiation therapy have been compared in patients with early-stage prostate cancer who have been randomly assigned to one or the other.\n\nTwo such studies are underway.

A small but growing number of hospitals offer the procedure. See photos.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Breast cancer treatment left Susan Wolfe-Tank with an arm too painfully swollen to lift anything heavy or even fit into her usual clothing — a debilitating condition that gets little attention and has no cure.\n\nDesperate, the Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to seek a delicate operation — replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery — as a small but growing number of hospitals offer microsurgical attempts at relief from lymphedema that help some patients but not all.\n\n“Right in this area, feel that — that is your lymph node,” Dr. David Song of MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington told Wolfe-Tank during a recent check-up.\n\nSong, Georgetown’s plastic surgery chief, had removed healthy lymph nodes from Wolfe-Tank’s back and side and implanted them in the affected arm. As the new nodes took root, her arm was shrinking. A delighted Song’s only caution: “Take care of them,” by wearing a compression sleeve as prescribed.\n\n“This isn’t a cure. I will still have to be careful,” said Wolfe-Tank, 51, of Hurley, Wisconsin. But, “I will be able to cross-country ski again, just live a normal life. Look at my arm, it’s incredible.”\n\nLymphedema is a chronic swelling, often in an arm or leg, that in severe cases can be disfiguring, impair mobility, cause disabling pain, harden the skin and lead to infection.\n\nLymph nodes work like biological pumps in a network that’s part of the immune system. They drain watery fluid called lymph that, traveling through tiny channels, brings nutrients to cells and takes away bacteria and waste material. Lose or damage enough lymph nodes or channels in a particular area and that fluid builds up.\n\nThere’s no good count, but millions of Americans are estimated to have some degree of lymphedema, and while it can be hereditary or result from injury, many U.S. cases are a lasting side effect of treatment for a variety of cancers.\n\nConsider breast cancer. While better surgical techniques in recent decades have lowered the risk, experts estimate that still about 6 percent of breast cancer survivors who undergo a “sentinel node biopsy” — removing a few nodes to check for spreading cancer — will develop lymphedema. That risk jumps to about 20 percent for women like Wolfe-Tank who need additional lymph nodes removed because of more advanced cancer. Radiation causes further harm.\n\nYet too often women aren’t warned about symptoms or checked for early signs, when lymphedema is more easily treated, said Dr. Sheldon Feldman of New York’s Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care. He co-authored physician guidelines issued this fall by the American Society of Breast Surgeons on prevention and treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema.\n\nTypical patients have “had that swelling for a while,” Feldman said. “Now the treatment is an uphill battle.”\n\nThe main treatment consists of wearing compression bandages and massage to bring down swelling. A lymphedema specialist initially prescribed a large pump that massaged Wolfe-Tank’s arm for an hour a night, temporarily relieving some of the pain.\n\n“But if I used my arm, I was back to square one,” Wolfe-Tank said. “I didn’t fit into my coat anymore. I live in the snow capital of Wisconsin. I’m not supposed to shovel. We’ve got to fix this.”\n\nWolfe-Tank had struggled for four years when an oncologist recommended lymph node transfer. The rationale: There are more lymph nodes in the body’s trunk than in the limbs — more avenues to drain off fluid — and thus it should be safe to move a few. Hunting for a surgeon, Wolfe-Tank found Song, who transferred about five nodes along with supportive blood vessels and other tissue, hoping they’d grow new channels to drain fluid.\n\nIt’s not the only option. A technique called lymphovenous bypass reroutes lymph-carrying channels, going around damaged or missing nodes to drain into veins instead.\n\nSome surgeons use a variation of that technique protectively, in hopes of preventing lymphedema from forming in the first place. During the initial cancer surgery, they check which lymph-carrying channels the node removal left dangling — and connect them to blood vessels to drain.\n\n“Surgical options offer great potential,” note the breast surgeons’ new guidelines. But they don’t work for everyone.\n\nAbout a third of lymph node transfer patients see some positive effect, Song said.\n\nAnd Feldman noted that over about the past decade, the microsurgeries have been studied only in small research trials, and results vary with surgeon experience. One debate is whether to offer lymph node transfer early, before patients build up as much damage as Wolfe-Tank did. Insurance coverage also varies.\n\nFeldman’s bottom line: Patients considering microsurgery should be evaluated in a comprehensive lymphedema program to determine their best options.\n\nCopyright © 2018 The Associated Press.

The article briefly cautions readers near the end of the story about the limited data and the need for patients to be evaluated by a “comprehensive lymphedema program.” But it doesn’t address costs, potential harms, and the actual number of women who might benefit from this invasive procedure. It also relies on a single anecdote of a Wisconsin woman whose condition rendered her unable to shovel snow or cross-country ski–a degree of severity that doesn’t appear to reflect the experience of most patients.

These researchers also found that most antidepressant medications have been linked to weight gain.\n\nPrior research on antidepressants and weight change was limited to one year or shorter. But many people take antidepressants--the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States--for longer than a year. So for up to two years the new study followed more than 5,000 Group Health patients who started taking an antidepressant. The Journal of Clinical Medicine published it: ""Long-Term Weight Change after Initiating Second-Generation Antidepressants.""\n\n""Our study suggests that bupropion is the best initial choice of antidepressant for the vast majority of Americans who have depression and are overweight or obese,"" said study leader David Arterburn, MD, MPH. He\'s a senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute (GHRI), a Group Health physician, and an affiliate associate professor in the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine\'s Department of Medicine. But in some cases, an overweight or obese patient has reasons why bupropion is not for them--like a history of seizure disorder--and it would be better for them to choose a different treatment option.\n\nStudy findings\n\n""We found that bupropion is the only antidepressant that tends to be linked to weight loss over two years,"" Dr. Arterburn said. ""All other antidepressants are linked to varying degrees of weight gain.""\n\nAfter two years, nonsmokers lost an average of 2.4 pounds on bupropion--compared with gaining an average of 4.6 pounds on fluoxetine (Prozac). So those who took bupropion ended up weighing 7 pounds less than did those on fluoxetine.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that difference wasn\'t seen in people who smoked tobacco. Bupropion is often used to help patients stop smoking. So smokers who take bupropion are likely to be trying to quit--and coping with the weight gain that often accompanies attempts to quit smoking.\n\nWho should try which antidepressant?\n\n""A large body of evidence indicates no difference in how effectively the newer antidepressants improve people\'s moods,"" said Dr. Arterburn\'s coauthor Gregory Simon, MD, MPH, a Group Health psychiatrist, GHRI senior investigator, and research professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UW School of Medicine. ""So it makes sense for doctors and patients to choose antidepressants on the basis of their side effects, costs, and patients\' preferences--and, now, on whether patients are overweight or obese.""\n\nBupropion should be considered the first-line drug of choice for people who are overweight or obese, Dr. Simon said. But patients should consult their doctor about which medication is right for them, before making any changes, including starting, switching, or stopping medication.\n\n###\n\nGrant R01 MH083671 from the National Institute of Mental Health funded this research.\n\nDrs.

A Possible Treatment for Anxiety, Insomnia","['Drinking cow’s milk produced at night may be a treatment for anxiety and insomnia, suggests an animal study in the Journal of Medicinal Food.\n\nA glass of milk at bedtime has long been touted as a sleep aid. But the study found that milk collected at night, or night milk, had enhanced sedative effects in mice compared with milk produced during the day. Night milk significantly decreased the rodents’ physical activity, balance and coordination and increased sleep time compared with day milk, the research showed.\n\nMice fed night milk were more inclined to explore open spaces, an indication of reduced anxiety that was comparable to the effects from consuming diazepam, a drug commonly used to treat anxiety in people, the researchers said.\n\nNight milk is rich in tryptophan, a sleep-inducing compound, and melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, the study said. Researchers in South Korea gave lab mice varying doses of dried milk powder made from cow’s milk collected during the day or night and mixed with distilled water. Analysis of the powders showed the night milk contained 24% more tryptophan and nearly 10 times as much melatonin as the day milk. Two groups of control mice received either injections of diazepam or plain drinking water. The mice underwent a series of tests about an hour after treatments. Mice that got night milk were significantly less active than either the mice fed day milk or water-fed controls. Diazepam-treated mice were the least active. Balance and coordination were measured by the number of falls from a rotating bar during a 20-minute period: Mice fed night milk on average fell four to five times, about twice as often as mice given day milk.

This is certainly the type of headline that grabs one’s attention. The claim is difficult to support, however, due to the inherent limitations of the underlying study. The article’s main shortcoming is that it mischaracterizes the quality of evidence presented by the study. Our concern is that the story misreports the comparisons that were made in the study. Contrary to what the article reports, night milk is never directly compared against day milk in the study. Nor is it ever directly compared against diapezam.

Osteoporosis was defined broadly, using both BMD criteria as well as recent history of nonvertebral fracture and confirmed prevalent vertebral fracture on x-ray. Overall, 2,463 patients between 49 and 86 years of age were randomized to one of three treatment arms for 18 months: double-blind 80 micrograms of abaloparatide-SC, blind-matched placebo, or open-label 20 micrograms of subcutaneous teriparatide (an FDA-approved prescription drug known to increase bone density and strength).\n\nAt 18 months, abaloparatide-SC significantly increased bone mineral density from baseline at the lumbar spine by 9.2%, the total hip by 3.4% and the femoral neck by 2.9%, compared with placebo.

If that isn\'t reason enough to fill your shopping basket, there\'s another reason to add this fruit to your grocery list. A new study, \'Fresh Pear Consumption is Associated with Better Nutrient Intake, Diet Quality, and Weight Parameters in Adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2010,\' published in Nutrition and Food Science, revealed new information regarding the health benefits of pear consumption.1 Of particular interest given the high rates of obesity in the United States, the study found that adult pear consumers had a lower body weight than non-pear consumers and they were 35 percent less likely to be obese.\n\nThe epidemiologic study, led by Carol O\'Neil of the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, used a nationally representative analytic sample to examine the association of fresh pear consumption with nutrient intake, nutrient adequacy, diet quality, and cardiovascular risk factors in adults.\n\n""The association between pears and lower body weight is very exciting,"" said Dr. Carol O\'Neil. ""We believe fiber intake may have driven the lower body weights that were seen in this study because there was no difference in energy intake or level of physical activity found between the fresh pear consumers and non-consumers.""\n\nIn addition to discovering a correlation between fresh pear consumers and lower body weight, the study found that pear consumption was associated with higher diet quality (as defined by the Healthy Eating Index). Moreover, the consumption of one medium fresh pear per day had a positive effect on nutrient intake since consumers had higher usual intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, copper, and potassium, and higher mean intakes of total sugars; consumers of fresh pears also had lower intakes of total, monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and added sugars.\n\nPears are an excellent source of fiber and a good source of vitamin C. One medium pear provides about 24 percent of daily fiber needs for only 100 calories. They are sodium-free, cholesterol-free, fat-free and contain 190 mg of potassium. The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans state that people who eat more fruit as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to reduce their risk of some chronic diseases, although little is published on the health outcomes associated with individual fruits, including pears.\n\nThe USA Pear Bureau continues to collaborate with researchers to commission additional studies that show the relationship between pears and positive health outcomes.

Today, the United States is the third largest pear-producing country in the world, and Oregon and Washington comprise the nation\'s largest pear growing region with 1,600 growers producing 84% of all fresh pears grown in the United States. Pears grown in these two Pacific Northwest states are distributed under the ""USA Pears"" brand. Pears are an excellent source of fiber (24% DV) and a good source of vitamin C (10% DV) for only 100 calories per medium sized pear.

The release describes results of an “analytic,” observational, data-mining study of some subset (readers never learn what subset, exactly) of pear-eating people among participants in the 2001-10 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey of adult Americans. The data suggested that people who reported eating pears had a “lower” body weight than non-pear eaters and were “35 percent less likely to be obese.”  From there it leaps to the idea that there are health benefits to eating a “pear a day,” attributing the benefits to the relatively high fiber content of the fruit. Although the release notes that the data suggest eating fresh pears “should be encouraged” as part of an “overall healthy diet;” and the lead investigator acknowledges in a quote that this is an “association” or “correlational” study, the body of the release offers no data to support the notion that pears are more likely than any other fiber source or food to actually reduce weight or obesity. It offers no information (as did the study, published in the journal Nutrition and Food Science) about the participants or the strengths/weaknesses of the correlation. And above all it fails to note that those who reported eating pears were older and seemed to be more health-conscious — they drank less alcohol and smoked less — all of which could have contributed to or even accounted for the lower body weight and lower risk of obesity. Most of the release is a predictable promotional piece for the wonders of Barletts and Boscs, noting of course that they are “cholesterol-free,” “fat-free” and potassium-rich.

It began years ago, when a gastroenterology surgeon approached parasitologist Alex Loukas, one of the senior authors on the new study. The doctor wanted to know whether there might be a connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“If you look at the data that comes in from immunological studies . . . where you remove the parasites [that's] where you see the highest incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies,” said Severine Navarro, the paper's lead author and a senior research fellow in Loukas's lab at James Cook University in Australia.\n\nMany parasites have evolved the ability to hide from their host's immune systems. When a hookworm crawls into a human, it secretes chemicals that turn off the immune alarm bells and repair the tissue around it. It limits its consumption of blood to a few drops a day and doesn't leave its offspring scattered all over its host's gut. (Instead, it thoughtfully plants them in the host's poop to ensure an orderly exit from the body.) Like a very conscientious cat burglar, the hookworm knows it's best served by not making a mess.\n\n“It's almost symbiotic,” Navarro said, “because in order for it to survive and thrive, it needs its host to be happy and healthy.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the adaptations that help the parasites stay hidden also benefit their host by reining in overactive immune systems.\n\nThinking that they might be onto something, the researchers found 12 adults with celiac disease — a serious genetic disorder that causes an autoimmune response to gluten — who volunteered to have doctors infect them with a slimy, slithery hookworm. It was important that the participants be adults, because even relatively benign parasites can cause serious problems for children, pregnant women and others. Navarro also warned people with autoimmune disorders that they should not attempt to infect themselves with a hookworm, no matter how debilitating their illness might be. Parasites are no joke.\n\nFor the dozen trial participants, the hookworm did improve their tolerance of gluten.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was an intriguing result, but it's difficult to scale that kind of study. Only so many people are willing to have a parasite put inside them for science. And because of the risks associated with parasites, going around infecting people isn't a viable treatment option.\n\nSo Navarro and her colleagues isolated the active ingredient in hookworm spit — a compound called AIP-2 — and injected it into asthmatic mice on a daily basis for five days. The animals' asthma systems substantially declined, and their airways became measurably less inflamed. These benefits persisted for 10 weeks after the mice stopped getting the treatment — “I don't even know how much that is in mouse years,” Navarro said.\n\nThe researchers also noticed that AIP-2 seemed to have a calming effect on the body's dendritic cells — a part of the immune system responsible for processing threats.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“It is basically rewiring the cells in that tissue into promoting very efficient regulatory T cells,” Navarro said, describing the cells that help modulate the immune system.\n\nThis suggests that AIP-2 might also help humans, since dendritic cells have the same function in us that they do in mice. Navarro said their next step is a phase one clinical trial, which would test the effectiveness of an AIP-2 pill.\n\nShould that work, it has the potential to help the 235 million people around the world who suffer from asthma. The compound might also be used to treat other autoimmune disorders, like celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.\n\nAD\n\nThis study would also suggest that humans lost something when we rid ourselves of the microbes and parasites that had evolved alongside us for tens of thousands of years. “There’s a major school of thought that says that these parasites should be encountered early in life to contribute to the education of the immune system,” Navarro said.\n\nAD\n\nShe wouldn't go so far as to call parasites good. Deworming campaigns and other public health efforts unquestionably have protected countless people from anemia, malnutrition, developmental disorders and potentially deadly infections.\n\n“But what we need is to find what's good in them,” she said, “and try to restore that missing component.”\n\nRead more:\n\nAD""]",This article is careful to convey the message that ingesting parasites on your own is not safe. What it doesn’t do is to provide a balanced picture of what the results of this study mean.,"Credit: The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences
This story reports on a group of researchers who have derived a compound from hookworm spit that they have tested with some success as a treatment for asthmatic mice. Scientists have observed for several years now that rates of autoimmune disorders and allergies are lower in some low-income nations. The idea is that hygienic practices in high-income nations may have robbed people’s immune systems of natural checks provided by parasites or other microorganisms in their environments. The result, according to this theory, is higher rates of diseases like asthma, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. The researchers quoted in this article first tried infecting patients with celiac disease with live hookworms, then in a more recent study synthesized a compound from hookworm spit for the mouse experiment.
The problem is that the article overstates the potential benefits of a treatment that has not yet been tested in humans (a problem we see fairly often in news stories). Given that limitation, we would expect the story would at least provide testimony by independent experts who could weigh in on whether this new finding is important or not, but it doesn’t. The results of existing and ongoing research on the same topic are mixed at this point, but the article doesn’t say so. In sum, this story doesn’t give readers to tools to assess either quality or impact of the research described.

Scott Turner, MD, PhD, director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University Medical Center. Turner, who treats patients at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, cautions that the findings cannot be used to recommend resveratrol. ""This is a single, small study with findings that call for further research to interpret properly.""\n\nThe resveratrol clinical trial was a randomized, phase II, placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer\'s disease. An ""investigational new drug"" application was required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to test the pure synthetic (pharmaceutical-grade) resveratrol in the study. It is not available commercially in this form.\n\nThe study enrolled 119 participants. The highest dose of resveratrol tested was one gram by mouth twice daily -- equivalent to the amount found in about 1,000 bottles of red wine.\n\nJohn Bozza, 80, participated in the study. Five years ago, his wife, Diana, began noticing ""something wasn\'t quite right."" He was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, but only a year later, his condition progressed to mild Alzheimer\'s.\n\nDiana, whose twin sister died from the same disease, says there are multiple reasons she and John decided to participate in the resveratrol study, and they now know he was assigned to take the active drug.\n\n""I definitely want the medical community to find a cure,"" she says. ""And of course I thought there\'s always a chance that John could have been helped, and who knows, maybe he was.""\n\nPatients, like John, who were treated with increasing doses of resveratrol over 12 months showed little or no change in amyloid-beta40 (Abeta40) levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. In contrast, those taking a placebo had a decrease in the levels of Abeta40 compared with their levels at the beginning of the study.\n\n""A decrease in Abeta40 is seen as dementia worsens and Alzheimer\'s disease progresses; still, we can\'t conclude from this study that the effects of resveratrol treatment are beneficial,"" Turner explains. ""It does appear that resveratrol was able to penetrate the blood brain barrier, which is an important observation. Resveratrol was measured in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid.""\n\nThe researchers studied resveratrol because it activates proteins called sirtuins, the same proteins activated by caloric restriction. The biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer\'s is aging, and studies with animals found that most age-related diseases--including Alzheimer\'s--can be prevented or delayed by long-term caloric restriction (consuming two-thirds the normal caloric intake).\n\nTurner says the study also found that resveratrol was safe and well tolerated. The most common side effects experienced by participants were gastrointestinal-related, including nausea and diarrhea. Also, patients taking resveratrol experienced weight loss while those on placebo gained weight.\n\nOne outcome in particular was confounding, Turner notes. The researchers obtained brain MRI scans on participants before and after the study, and found that resveratrol-treated patients lost more brain volume than the placebo-treated group.\n\n""We\'re not sure how to interpret this finding. A similar decrease in brain volume was found with some anti-amyloid immunotherapy trials,"" Turner adds. A working hypothesis is that the treatments may reduce inflammation (or brain swelling) found with Alzheimer\'s.\n\nThe study, funded by the National Institute on Aging and conducted with the Alzheimer\'s Disease Cooperative Study, began in 2012 and ended in 2014. GUMC was one of 21 participating medical centers across the U.S.\n\nFurther studies, including analysis of frozen blood and cerebrospinal fluid taken from patients, are underway to test possible drug mechanisms.\n\n""Given safety and positive trends toward effectiveness in this phase 2 study, a larger phase 3 study is warranted to test whether resveratrol is effective for individuals with Alzheimer\'s -- or at risk for Alzheimer\'s,"" Turner says.\n\nResveratrol and similar compounds are being tested in many age-related disorders including cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. The study Turner led, however, is the largest, longest and highest dose trial of resveratrol in humans to date.\n\n###\n\nThe research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging (U01 AG010483). Turner reports no personal financial interests related to the study. About Georgetown University Medical Center\n\nGeorgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) is an internationally recognized academic medical center with a three-part mission of research, teaching and patient care (through MedStar Health). GUMC\'s mission is carried out with a strong emphasis on public service and a dedication to the Catholic, Jesuit principle of cura personalis -- or ""care of the whole person."" The Medical Center includes the School of Medicine and the School of Nursing & Health Studies, both nationally ranked; Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, designated as a comprehensive cancer center by the National Cancer Institute; and the Biomedical Graduate Research Organization, which accounts for the majority of externally funded research at GUMC including a Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Institutes of Health.']","Overall, this was a solid news release for a recent phase II trial studying resveratrol and an example for other institutions announcing findings from preliminary studies.","Resveratrol is an antioxidant compound found in grapes and red wine.
This news release from Georgetown University Medical Center does a thorough job laying out the main points of a resveratrol phase II clinical trial. It reasonably talks about the study’s findings and design, while cautioning readers on how researchers must pursue further studies before recommending the drug.
Given this cautious overall framing, we view the release’s omissions as relatively minor. One concern is that the release could have put the potential benefits and the harms into better perspective. For example, readers aren’t told how much levels of the biomarker (Abeta40) would normally decrease in Alzheimer’s patients and how this compares to what was found in the study. Readers also don’t know how many patients suffered from side effects from the concentrated supplement. It would also be interesting to know what existing Alzheimer’s drugs already on the market can do and how resveratrol might compare.
But for the most part, this news release – including its use of language – was appropriately tempered and very informative, hitting home the message that these research findings are preliminary.
Note: We also looked at how this study was covered by Time magazine and CNN, and compared the framing of the results in this news release vs. the subsequent stories.

However, one drug, aflibercept, provided greater improvement for people with more severe vision loss when treatment was initiated. The trial was conducted by the National Eye Institute Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) including researchers from Joslin Diabetes Center. The results appeared in the February online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDiabetes is a significant risk factor for developing eye diseases. The most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness is diabetic retinopathy, which is caused by elevated blood sugar levels damaging the blood vessels of the retina and affects approximately 7.7 million Americans. About 750,000 Americans with diabetic retinopathy have diabetic macular edema (DME) in which fluid leaks into the macula, the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The fluid causes the macula to swell, blurring vision. “DME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in working-age adults with diabetes. With the rate of diabetes increasing dramatically worldwide, many individuals will be at risk for vision loss from diabetic eye complications and DME is a major global health concern,” says Jennifer K. Sun, M.D., M.P.H., a member of the study research team and writing committee, and an Investigator in the Section on Vascular Biology, an ophthalmologist in Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin and an Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nIn an earlier study, Joslin researchers reported that VEGF, a major growth factor for blood vessels, is elevated in the eye fluids of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and DME, causing leakage and the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Over the past few years, drugs that target VEGF have become a standard treatment for DME, providing a preferred alternative or adjunct to laser treatment. The standard Medicare per-injection costs of the three anti-VEGF drugs evaluated in the study are about $1960 for aflibercept (Eylea), $1200 for ranibizumab (Lucentis) and $70 for bevacizumab (Avastin).\n\nAt the start of the trial, 660 adults with DME were enrolled: their average age was 61 years and 90 percent had type 2 diabetes. About half of the participants had 20/32 or 20/40 vision and the other half had vision of 20/50 or worse. They were randomized into three treatment groups and received the assigned study drug by injection into the eye until the DME resolved or stabilized. Participants on bevacizumab and ranibizumab received, on average, 10 injections, versus nine for those on aflibercept.\n\nOne year after starting treatment, all participants had improved vision. Those with mild vision loss (20/32 to 20/40) at baseline in all three treatment groups gained on average almost two lines on an eye chart. For participants with more severe vision loss (20/50 or worse), aflibercept improved vision on average nearly four lines, bevacizumab about 2.5 lines, and ranibizumab almost three lines.\n\n“The results clearly remove any doubts about anti-VEGF drugs’ efficacy in treating DME. All three drugs improved vision substantially, with aflibercept showing more visual gains in patients with worse vision at the start of the trial. Physicians now have robust data to help them counsel patients and make informed decisions regarding treatment options,” says study co-author Lloyd P. Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, Director of Joslin’s Beetham Eye Institute, co-head of Joslin's Section of Vascular Cell Biology, and founding chair of the DRCR Network.\n\nIn light of these positive results, “it is more important than ever for patients with diabetes to be evaluated on a regular basis for eye disease and receive treatment promptly once indicated as we now have excellent success in treating patients with DME,” says Dr. Aiello.\n\nThe trial was supported through a cooperative agreement from the National Eye Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Regeneron Pharmaceutical provided the aflibercept and Genentech provided the ranibizumab for the study. The DRCR.net had complete control over the design of the study, data ownership and content of presentations and publications related to this study.\n\nAbout Joslin Diabetes Center\n\nJoslin Diabetes Center, based in Boston, Massachusetts, undertakes diabetes research, clinical care, education and health and wellness programs on a global scale.

The Food and Drug Administration denied the request, asking for more safety data from the company before moving forward.\n\nAccording to the report, there were specific concerns about each drug\'s safety individually; specifically Topamax, which is reported to cause some psychiatric and cognitive side effects and may cause clef palate birth defects if taken while pregnant.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer\'s study, the two drugs, when taken together, and at controlled-release doses, were very safe. Participants in the trial reported minor side effects such as dry mouth and constipation, however at higher doses, some participants did complain about some psychiatric side effects.\n\nAmong the 2,487 study participants, nine became pregnant, and none of their children were born with cleft palates, the report said.\n\nThe drug could be a good option for some people, but it\'s most likely not a silver bullet, said Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth\'s physician nutrition expert, who is not connected with the study.\n\n""This might be a good tool in the short term to get someone motivated, and that\'s great,"" she said. ""But unless it\'s paired with aggressive lifestyle changes, it may not be great in the long term.""\n\nPhentermine is commonly used as a short-term weight loss treatment, and was previously paired with fenfluramine to make the successful but now-discontinued weight loss drug Fen-phen. Fen-phen was removed from the market in 1997 amid concerns about the drug\'s heart risk, but phentermine has been used successfully for short-term appetite suppression since then with no major safety concerns.\n\nTopamax is commonly used to treat migraines and seizures.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story bit on the “significant promise” reported in a new study, but thereby lacked some of the cautionary context provided by a competing <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3812"" target=""_blank"">LA Times piece</a>.</span>","Perhaps if we had not compared the CNN.com story with the LA Times piece, our comments might be more glowing.  It covered a lot of the bases – addressing most of our criteria.

(PAHS), developer of the drug-free Freespira® treatment for panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, today announced that another study has demonstrated clinically significant symptom improvement, with 80% of patients panic attack free one year after treatment.\n\nThis latest study, conducted as part of the VITAL Program at Allegheny Health Network in Pennsylvania, also demonstrated a 50% reduction in healthcare costs in patients with panic symptoms 12 months after being treated with Freespira.\n\nA Symposium at the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) Annual Conference in Washington, DC focused on the impact of abnormal breathing patterns on anxiety-related conditions and treatments as reported in five studies. Two studies reported nearly 80% of Freespira-treated patients were panic attack free at 12 months post-treatment. Two additional studies reported that patients with mixed anxiety disorders and low exhaled CO2 at baseline were less responsive and/or discontinued treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Therapy.\n\nEarly data from a fifth study reported on Freespira treatment for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ninety percent of patients in this study experienced a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms at two months and six months post-treatment.\n\nSymposium Chair David Tolin, Ph.D., Director of Anxiety Disorders Center, The Institute of Living, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, commented, ""Studies of the Freespira treatment have shown that this innovative approach to treating patients suffering from panic symptoms and panic attacks not only significantly reduces or eliminates these symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, but also results in meaningful reduction in health costs.""\n\nDebra Reisenthel, CEO of Palo Alto Health Sciences, added, ""Patients with panic symptoms and panic attacks have 3-5 times higher medical costs than patients without panic due to higher utilization of medical resources, including ED visits, physician visits and prescription drugs.""\n\nFreespira is both easy to use and effective. Once a licensed healthcare provider authorizes the treatment and after a single training session, the patient uses Freespira at home, performing two 17-minute breathing sessions a day over a four-week period, after which the treatment is complete. The peer-reviewed published multi-center Freespira clinical trial, presented by Dr. Tolin, demonstrated that 71% of patients were panic attack free immediately after treatment and 79% of patients were panic attack free 12 months post-treatment.\n\nAbout Freespira\n\nFreespira is an FDA-cleared, drug-free, four-week at-home treatment for panic attacks and other panic symptoms. Treatment is authorized and completed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Freespira is clinically proven to reduce or eliminate panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, a mental health condition in which debilitating anxiety leads to life-altering avoidance behaviors. Individuals with panic chronically hyperventilate, even when not experiencing a panic attack. This abnormal breathing pattern has been shown to exacerbate attacks. Freespira works by training the patient to stabilize respiration rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, which reduces or eliminates panic attacks.\n\nAbout Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.\n\nPalo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. is a privately held digital therapeutic company revolutionizing behavioral healthcare with evidence-based, non-invasive, drug-free solutions. Their first product, Freespira, is an FDA-cleared treatment for individuals suffering from panic disorder, panic attacks and other symptoms of panic. In the United States, over 6.7 million adults annually suffer from panic disorder; panic attacks affect a total of 27 million adults in the U.S. every year and are a common component of other anxiety disorders.\n\nFreespira is commercially available throughout the U.S. To learn more, visit http://www.freespira.com or contact info@pahealthsciences.com.\n\nMEDIA CONTACT\n\nMichele Kong\n\n(800) 735-8995\n\nSOURCE Palo Alto Health Sciences\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://freespira.com\n\n']",The release also claims that the device reduces costs by 50% and PTSD by 90% — again without providing any evidence or study references.,"This news release claims that 80% of patients with panic attacks due to anxiety could get relief after 4 weeks of using a biofeedback device and training package known as Freespira. The device includes a sensor to measure carbon dioxide in the breath of a patient, and a tablet computer and an app to help them understand and change their breathing and potentially avoid panic attacks. The Freespira system is FDA cleared to market to patients for at-home use with physician guidance. But the release does not give us the date or publication of corroborating studies and simply says there was a presentation at a conference about these results. We are left unable to judge the news value of the latest study from such scant details.
To our knowledge, the most recent study about this biofeedback device was published a year ago.

The examination relies on gadolinium-based contrast agents that need to be injected intravenously.\n\nResearchers recently studied an alternative approach that eliminates the need for contrast agents in some cases by using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measurements derived from MRI. The technique, known as diffusion kurtosis imaging, provides a picture of breast tissue on a microstructural level.\n\n""Diffusion kurtosis imaging has been introduced in DWI to provide important information on tissue structures at a microscopic level,"" said study lead author Sebastian Bickelhaupt, M.D., from the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. ""Since malignant lesions disrupt the tissue structures at this level, diffusion kurtosis might serve as a relevant marker of changes.""\n\nDr. Bickelhaupt, co-lead author Paul Jaeger, M.Sc., and colleagues evaluated a retrospective analysis of data collected from 222 women at two independent study sites. The women had suspicious findings on mammography that were classified under the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) as BI-RADS 4 and 5 breast lesions. A BI-RADS 4 lesion is considered a suspicious abnormality, while a 5 is considered highly suspicious of malignancy. The women underwent DWI followed by biopsy.\n\nFor the analysis, a software algorithm was developed for lesion characterization, and imaging features were extracted using a kurtosis-based radiomics model. Radiomics is a rapidly growing field that enables the extraction of a large amount of quantifiable data from images.\n\nIn an independent test set of 127 women, the radiomics analysis reduced false-positive findings by 70 percent, while detecting 60 of 61 malignant lesions, or 98 percent.\n\n""The model might help to lower the number of BI-RADS 4 lesions suspected of being cancer on the basis of screening mammography while retaining a high sensitivity similar to the sensitivity reported for biopsies themselves,"" Jaeger said.\n\nShould the results hold in larger trials, the model has potential advantages in the clinic beyond its ability to reduce unnecessary biopsies in women with BI-RADS 4 lesions. The software algorithm makes the assessment reader-independent, ensuring that its accuracy is maintained across different imaging facilities.\n\nThe new approach is not intended to replace current contrast-enhanced breast MRI protocols in general, Dr. Bickelhaupt emphasized, but to expand the spectrum of options available for answering specific clinical questions.\n\n""This might also improve the efficiency of reporting,"" he said.\n\n###\n\n""Radiomics Based on Adapted Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Helps to Clarify Most Mammographic Findings Suspicious for Cancer.""

story_reviews_00522,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/is-sugar-definitely-toxic/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,"Sugar Is Definitely Toxic, a New Study Says","[""Fat was the food villain these past few decades but sugar is quickly muscling in to take its place. As rates of sugar-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease climb, many experts believe that when Americans rid themselves of fat, they simply replaced it with sugar in all its forms.\n\nBut proving that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. Dr. Robert Lustig, from the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, who has made a name for himself publishing books and research addressing the question of sugar’s effects on the body, wanted clearer answers. Now, in a paper published Tuesday, he and his colleagues believe they have come up with the definitive evidence that sugar, as Lustig says, “is toxic.”\n\nIn most lab studies, the doses of sugar that scientists test are quite high; they want to see what the effect is quickly and, depending on the research, they may not have time to wait to study the more gradual effects that might emerge. And in studies where people reduce the amount of sugar they eat, for instance, those people end up eating fewer calories overall, so it’s difficult to know whether any changes are due to the removal of sugar or to the drop in calories.\n\nLustig and his colleagues think they’ve produced the “hard and fast data that sugar is toxic irrespective of its calories and irrespective of weight.”\n\nMORE: FDA Wants Nutrition Labels to Include More Detail on Added Sugars\n\nLustig’s confidence comes from the unique study, described in Obesity, of 43 Hispanic or African-American children aged eight to 18 years old. He collected detailed food questionnaires from each of the adolescents to get an idea of the average amount of calories they ate per day, then designed a special menu for each of them for nine days that matched the total numbers of calories they would normally eat. The only difference in the nine-day diet was that most of the sugar the children ate was replaced by starch — the overall number of calories remained the same. The children weighed themselves daily, and if they were losing weight, they were told to eat more of the provided food in order to keep their weight the same throughout the study.\n\n“Everything got better,” says Lustig. Some of the children went from being insulin resistant, a precursor state to developing diabetes, in which the body’s insulin levels can no longer keep up with the pace of breaking down sugar that’s coming in from the diet, to insulin sensitive.\n\nMORE: Artificial Sweeteners Aren’t the Answer to Obesity: Here’s Why\n\n“We took chicken teriyaki out, and put turkey hot dogs in. We took sweetened yogurt out, and put baked potato chips in. We took pastries out and put bagels in,” says Lustig. “So there was no change in [the children’s] weight and no change in calories.”\n\nAfter nine days of having their total dietary sugar reduced to 10% of their daily calories, however, they showed improvements in all of these measures. Overall, their fasting blood sugar levels dropped by 53%, along with the amount of insulin their bodies produced since insulin is normally needed to break down carbohydrates and sugars. Their triglyceride and LDL levels also declined and, most importantly, they showed less fat in their liver.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But Lustig relied on the starches to prove a point in a scientific study — that the effect sugar has on the body goes beyond anything connected to its calories and to weight. “I’m not suggesting in any way, shape or form that we gave them healthy food,” he says. “We gave them crappy food, shitty food, processed food — and they still got better. Imagine how much even better they would have gotten if we didn’t substitute and took the sugar out. Then they would have gotten even better yet. That’s the point.”\n\nMORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. Susan Roberts, professor of Nutrition, USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University notes that because some of the children lost weight, it’s still possible that shedding the pounds helped their metabolic measures to improve. She also points out that the children self-reported their initial diet, which can often be inaccurate. “We know that a healthy diet and weight loss cause good metabolic changes, and although this study tries to attribute its effects to low fructose, in fact it is impossible to do that because of the study design.”\n\nSome experts are concerned for other reasons. They’re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue — that overall, we’re eating too much. “Too much calorie intake is still the biggest problem,” says Dr. Mark Corkins, professor of pediatrics at University of Tennessee Health Science Center and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. He notes that the study involved children who were obese already and consuming too many calories. “It’s an important study, and the facts coming out of it are very important. It means we need to look at sugars, and at the type of sugars and sugar intake. But I worry that people are going to hang everything on this when we still need to reduce consumption.”\n\nLustig hopes that won’t happen as more data emerges that details how sugar is altering the body in unhealthy ways outside of its caloric contribution. That wasn’t the subject of the current paper, but he promises follow up studies based on this work that will address that. This study does hint however, at what might be happening. While there has been a lot of attention on the presence of belly fat and its connection to metabolic syndrome, the fact that the children saw improvements in the amount of fat in their liver suggests that might be an important way that sugar is contributing to chronic disease. Obese children and those with diabetes often suffer from fatty liver, a condition normally associated with alcohol abuse but increasingly common among non-drinkers who gain excessive amounts of weight.\n\nThis new view of sugar could change the advice that doctors and government health officials give about eating the sweet stuff. Lustig’s hope is that the information is considered as the U.S. Department of Agriculture finalizes its latest Dietary Guidelines, expected by the end of the year, which delineate recommendations for what, and how much of different types of foods and nutrients Americans should eat.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]","There was room for improvement, but readers who make it the end of this piece should come away with a reasonably thorough understanding of this study’s findings and what they might mean.","This news story reports that a diet study, conducted on 43 overweight minority children and teenagers, is believed by the researchers who did it to definitively prove that sugar — in and of itself — is metabolically toxic regardless of how much or little of it is eaten, and irrespective of the weight of the eaters. It does a solid job of describing the design of the study and discussing why the evidence it provides is qualitatively different from previous research. But we thought the framing of the story was off kilter, as it leads with lots of glowing discussion about the strength and importance of the research, while putting important caveats and limitations far down in the piece. We also think the story could have been more thorough in its discussion of those limitations — including the fact that 43 is a small number of participants, the study was very short in duration, and it had no control group.

He has a great job as the creative director of an advertising firm in New York City. He enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.\n\nAnd it has all been possible, he says, because for the past six years he has been taking a drug called ketamine.\n\nBefore ketamine, James was unable to work or focus his thoughts. His mind was filled with violent images. And his mood could go from ebullient to dark in a matter of minutes.\n\nKetamine ""helped me get my life back,"" says James, who asked that we not use his last name to protect his career.\n\nKetamine was developed as a human and animal anesthetic in the 1960s. And almost from the time it reached the market it has also been used as a mind-bending party drug.\n\nBut ketamine\'s story took a surprising turn in 2006, when researchers at the National Institutes of Health showed that an intravenous dose could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours. Since then, doctors have prescribed ketamine ""off label"" to thousands of depressed patients who don\'t respond to other drugs.\n\nAnd pharmaceutical companies are testing several new ketamine-related drugs to treat depression. Johnson & Johnson expects to seek approval for its nasal spray esketamine later this year, though the approval would be limited to use in a clinical setting.\n\nMeanwhile, doctors have begun trying ketamine on patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders other than depression. And there is now growing evidence it can help people with anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and perhaps even obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n""I think it\'s actually one of the biggest advances in psychiatry in a very long time,"" says Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Developmental Biopsychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital.\n\nKetamine may also offer new hope for people like James who have symptoms of several different psychiatric disorders.\n\nJames had a happy childhood, he says. But his thoughts were out of control. ""I always felt like I was crossing a freeway and my thoughts were just racing past me,"" he says.\n\nHe spent much of his childhood terrified of ""an unknown, an ambiguous force out there."" The fear was ""overwhelming,"" he says. ""I literally slept with the cover over my head with just room to breathe through my mouth until I went to college.""\n\nAnd there was something else about James: his body temperature.\n\n""I overheated constantly,"" he says. ""I would wear shorts all year long. In my 20s in my apartment I would sleep with the windows open in the middle of the winter.""\n\nIn his late 20s, James saw a doctor who told him he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. So he started taking stimulants.\n\nAt first, the pills helped him focus. Then they didn\'t, no matter how many he took.\n\nHe\'d done well as an idea guy in the advertising industry. But now James was trying to work at home, and it wasn\'t going well.\n\n""ADHD pills will make you interested in anything,"" he says. ""So I was putting the desk together and taking the desk apart. I was putting a laptop stand together and taking it apart. I was going in a massive downward spiral.""\n\nJames had always suffered from mood swings. But now they were rapid and extreme. And he couldn\'t stop thinking about gruesome scenarios, like a murderer coming for his family.\n\n""My wife took a summer off to be with me because she was scared of what was going to happen to me,"" he says. ""She would go to work for a few hours, then rush home. There would be times I\'d call her just screaming, \'Please come home. I can\'t get through another minute.\' ""\n\nEventually, James found his way to Dr. Demitri Papolos, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\n""He was like a whirling dervish when he came into my office,"" Papolos says. ""He was extremely fearful and scanning the environment all the time and he overheated at the drop of a hat.""\n\nPapolos diagnosed James with a variant of bipolar disorder he calls the ""fear of harm phenotype."" It typically appears in childhood and often doesn\'t respond to traditional psychiatric drugs.\n\nBut Papolos has found that the condition does respond to ketamine. ""It\'s been transformational,"" he says.\n\nIn January, Papolos published a study of 45 children with the problem. They inhaled a nasal mist containing ketamine about twice a week. Nearly all got dramatically better.\n\nScientists still aren\'t sure why ketamine works, but there\'s evidence that it encourages the brain to rewire, to alter the connections between cells. That process has been linked to recovery from depression. And it may also explain why ketamine helps people who have symptoms associated with several different psychiatric disorders.\n\n""I think it\'s having multiple effects, and that means it\'s probably useful for multiple different disorders,"" Teicher says.\n\nOne of those effects involves a part of the brain involved in temperature regulation. And that could explain why patients like James usually stop overheating once they are taking ketamine.\n\nJames started taking a ketamine nasal spray every other day. He says his response was dramatic.\n\n""One day I turn to my wife and I\'m like, \'I feel calm today. I don\'t know if it\'s the sun coming in, I don\'t know if it\'s just the way we\'re sitting here, but I feel like I could go and sit at the computer and work.\' ""\n\nThe next day, James did sit down at his computer. A month later, he was back at work.']","The story makes sweeping statements, without support, favoring the use of ketamine to treat a vast array of ills.","Can ketamine help people with depression and other psychiatric diagnoses? Unfortunately, this story doesn’t answer that question, beyond vague claims about one patient’s outcome. It skips any discussion of limitations of the studies or caveats about their conclusions. Importantly, it does not tell readers about the side effects reported in these and other studies. The only two experts quoted are advocates of expanded ketamine use. One of them has applied for a patent on a ketamine delivery device, which is not disclosed.
There is little that differentiates this story from others reported by the same journalist on numerous occasions; for example, in early 2012, later in 2012, 2015 and again last year.

But tests of muscle tissue in mice with a normal SIRT1 gene that were given resveratrol found that the substance boosted mitochondrial function.\n\nMitochondria provide the energy that cells need to function. A decrease in mitochondrial energy production has been linked to a variety of diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer\'s disease, as well as to the aging process itself, said senior study author David Sinclair, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nBut don\'t go reaching for that Chianti yet. Yes, resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes. But ""the amounts we gave to our mice would be like drinking 100 glasses of red wine a day,"" Sinclair said.\n\nInstead, the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate SIRT1 and could be taken as medication. ""My colleagues are in the middle of developing better molecules that we hope will be medicines that will be used to treat diseases of aging, not to extend lifespan, though that may be a side effect,"" Sinclair said.\n\nThe study is in the May 1 issue of Cell Metabolism.\n\nWhile previous studies have also suggested that resveratrol may have anti-aging properties, the precise mechanism of resveratrol has been controversial. Several studies, including work with yeast, worms and flies, have found that resveratrol acts on a class of seven genes known as sirtuins and, in human cells, SIRT1 in particular.\n\nBut other researchers have argued that resveratrol may work by activating a separate energy pathway called AMPK, which is also related to mitochondrial energy production but does not involve sirtuin genes.\n\nTesting the effect of resveratrol on SIRT1 in mice was difficult, Sinclair said. Mice that have their SIRT1 gene deleted are born with developmental defects and are unsuitable for experiments, he explained.\n\nSo Sinclair and two graduate students, Nathan Price and Ana Gomes, worked for years to come up with a method for knocking out SIRT1 in healthy adult mice.\n\n""Our paper found you absolutely require the SIRT1 gene for resveratrol to improve the metabolism of the mice,"" Sinclair said.\n\nThe paper also showed that the AMPK pathway was activated in mice given high doses of resveratrol, yet there was no benefit to mitochondrial function. There was no effect on AMPK in mice given a lower dose of resveratrol.\n\nSinclair is co-founder and a consultant for Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing resveratrol-like molecules for use as treatment for age-related diseases. In 2010, according to news reports, the company, which is owned by GlaxoSmithKline, halted clinical trials of resveratrol, but Sinclair said the company continues to develop improved synthetic molecules.\n\nGeorge Vlasuk, CEO of Sirtris, said the new findings offer the ""first definitive evidence"" for a direct link between SIRT1 and the metabolic benefits of resveratrol.\n\n""The work by [first author] Price et al. strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at Sirtris, which focuses on the development of small-molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging,"" Vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal.\n\nPhilippe Marambaud, an investigator at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Research in Alzheimer\'s Disease and Memory Disorders at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y, said the new research adds to a body of evidence that resveratrol can potentially combat aging by boosting mitochondrial activity.\n\n""In this study, by using an elegant adult-inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse model, the authors now provide compelling evidence that SIRT1 is required in vivo [in the animal] for the effect of resveratrol on AMPK activation and on mitochondrial function,"" Marambaud said.\n\nWhile studies involving animals can be useful, they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans.\n\n""A mouse model is not a human being, especially when you are genetically manipulating this animal model, you want to be very careful,"" Marambaud said. ""This field has been extremely controversial. We should be very careful about claiming the importance of resveratrol for medical purposes. We have to wait and see, but this study is a big step forward.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on healthy aging.']",This story seems determined to pump life into the resveratrol legend – with a sensational headline and a lack of details about why a 2010 trial was halted. Are we really down to reporting on improved mitochondrial function in mice for a consumer audience?,"But when you turn over 90% of a story to a researcher who is a co-founder of and consultant for a company working on a drug and then quote the CEO of that company as well, it’s no surprise that you get a rosy projection.
If you care about this stuff, a far better piece of reporting was done by Nature News, “Row over resveratrol rumbles on.“

WHEN SHOULD WOMEN GET A MAMMOGRAM? WHEN SHOULD WOMEN GET A MAMMOGRAM? Experts disagree: Age 40: The American Cancer Society says women should get annual mammograms beginning at age 40. Ages 50-74: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force says women ages 50 to 74 should get screened every other year, and women in their 40s who have a much lower risk of dying from breast cancer should decide for themselves, rather than automatically getting screened. Source: USA TODAY reporting LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM For readers, by readers: Patients, survivors, loved ones touched by any type of cancer invited to share questions, advice, experiences Nearly one year after the publication of controversial breast cancer screening guidelines by a government-appointed expert panel, a new study suggests benefits of mammograms may be more modest than previously estimated. In a nationwide study in Norway, women in their 50s and 60s who got a mammogram every other year reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 10%, compared with those who didn\'t get the exams, according to a study in today\'s New England Journal of Medicine. That\'s a much smaller benefit than estimated by even the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which says mammograms reduce breast cancer mortality by 15% to 23%. The task force\'s recommendations — advising that women may not need to begin screening until age 50 — ignited a fierce debate last November, in the midst of deliberations over health care reform. In the new study, researchers tried to determine whether recent declines in breast cancer mortality were the result of mammograms or better treatments and awareness. Norway\'s breast screening program includes mammograms as well as innovative treatment teams to coordinate a variety of specialty care. Doctors looked at two groups of women who were similar in most ways, except that one group received mammograms and the other didn\'t. While deaths from breast cancer fell 28% from 1996 to 2005 among participating women, they also fell 18% for unscreened women. That suggests that mammograms can\'t get all the credit for the falling death rate, the study says. Instead, mammograms probably cut mortality by only 10%, the difference between the two groups, the study says. Some say the new study helps women have a more realistic understanding of what mammograms offer. For 50-year-old women, mammograms may cut the 10-year risk of dying from breast cancer from 4.4 in 1,000 to 4 in 1,000, says H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth Medical School, who wrote an accompanying editorial. Welch notes that most people are unaware of the risk of mammograms: They sometimes detect slow-growing tumors that don\'t pose a threat. Because doctors can\'t reliably tell which are life-threatening, however, they tend to treat all of them. Studies suggest that for every life saved by mammograms, five to 15 women may go through unnecessary treatment, he says. Other experts note that the study may underestimate mammogram\'s benefits. Researchers followed women for an average of only two years, which may not be long enough to notice a big difference in mortality, says Daniel Kopans, a spokesman for the American College of Radiology. It\'s also possible that some women listed in the unscreened group actually got mammograms on their own, outside of Norway\'s national program, which could blur the differences between the two groups. ""The authors confirm that screenings save lives,"" Kopans said in a statement. ""There is no universal cure in sight. Until one is found, annual screening and early detection, beginning by the age of 40, offer women the best chance for a cure.""

Not surprisingly, it is also detrimental to mental health.\n\nThree decades of research has shown cognitive behavioral therapy to be equally effective to a pill for insomnia, with fewer side effects. Yet the time and resource-intense strategy — usually involving between six- and eight hour-long appointments with a clinical psychologist - is not widely available and its cost, generally hundreds of dollars, is prohibitive for many.\n\nBuysse and his colleagues wondered if the pill-free treatment could be shortened and simplified, providing more rapid results at a lower cost.\n\nTo find out, they studied 79 adults with chronic insomnia. Participants averaged 72 years of age and were randomly assigned to receive either printed educational material about sleep or the brief behavioral treatment consisting of one 45- to 60-minute in-person session, a 30-minute follow-up session and two 20-minute phone calls.\n\nA mental health nurse practitioner in a regular doctor’s office focused the behavioral instruction on how to restrict time in bed and set regular sleep-wake schedules, while also discussing the biological rationale behind the strategy, including the body’s daily cycles of physical, mental and behavioral changes.\n\n“This (therapy) has the effect of compressing your sleep into a more solid block,” Buysse told Reuters Health in an e-mail. “More consolidated sleep is more refreshing.”\n\nBased on questionnaires and sleep diaries, the researchers found that two out of every three participants receiving the behavioral intervention responded favorably by the end of 4 weeks, while just one out of every four receiving the printed material experienced substantial improvement in their sleep.\n\nThe gap was similarly wide when the researchers looked at the number of participants who no longer met the criteria for insomnia: 55 percent versus 13 percent.\n\nOn average, for every 2.4 participants treated, one responded favorably and one overcame insomnia, report the researchers in the Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nThese improvements were sustained for at least 6 months, and were backed up by data from a sleep monitor worn on the wrist or ankle. When the researchers looked at information from a different, more in-depth sleep monitoring system, however, they failed to find significantly better outcomes with the behavioral therapy.\n\nThe new results were similar to those previously published on the more intense cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n“A lot of insomniacs spend a lot of time lying in bed worrying about their sleep, among other things. They expect to have insomnia,” Dr. Thomas Neylan of the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying commentary in the journal, told Reuters Health.\n\n“Generally, the most expedient thing to do is just prescribe a sleeping pill,” noted Neylan.\n\nBut the drugs can pose problems, ranging from dependence or abuse to cognitive impairment during the day. And the risks may be even more pronounced among older patients, added senior author Timothy Monk, also of the University of Pittsburgh. Under the influence of the drugs, seniors may be more likely to fall and fracture a bone.\n\nWhile brief behavioral treatment for insomnia is not yet generally available, Monk told Reuters Health in an e-mail that his team hopes their findings will be “an important first step in that process.”\n\nIn the meantime, Neylan offers insomniacs some advice: “If you’re not ready to fall asleep, don’t lie down in bed and try to force yourself to sleep. And if you wake up in the middle of night and don’t fall back asleep easily, get out of bed.”\n\n“You don’t want to have any linkage between the experience of lying in bed and being awake,” he said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/fO01ME Archives of Internal Medicine, online January 24, 2011.']",A generally well done report on a very preliminary study.  We would only have hoped for a few more caveats.,"



There is a lot to like about the possibility of a treatment for insomnia that doesn’t rely on sleeping pills or intense and expensive counseling by specialists. While this story paints a reasonably fair picture of a small test of a brief behavioral therapy for insomnia, the overall impression given to readers may have shaded toward emphasizing the positive while skipping over uncertainties, future research challenges and possible alternative approaches.

Seaman\n\nMelanoma survivors may want to enlist partners to help search their bodies for suspicious looking moles, according to new research.\n\nThe researchers previously found that skin cancer survivors and their partners could be trained to spot potentially cancerous moles by doing skin exams. The new report shows that during the two years, those same people had increasing confidence in their skills, with no increase in embarrassment or discomfort.\n\n“There was concern that they might be embarrassed by examining areas of the body that aren’t normally seen close up,” said lead author Dr. June Robinson, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\n\nMelanoma survivors were previously told to use mirrors to check inaccessible areas of their bodies, she told Reuters Health.\n\n“For example, men can’t see the top of their bald heads or the back of their necks or ears,” Robinson said.\n\nThe new study focused on 395 pairs of melanoma survivors who had received training in skin exams in the original study. The participants attended “booster” training sessions and completed surveys every four months for the next two years.\n\nOverall, the trained group found 51 early melanomas during the study, compared to 18 melanomas found by a comparison group of patients and partners who didn’t receive training.\n\nAmong people who received the skin exam training, the researchers found a steep increase in their confidence at performing skin exams between the start of the study and four months later.\n\n“Their confidence level goes up and plateaus at eight to 12 months, and it doesn’t go down,” said Robinson.\n\nThe exams didn’t become more embarrassing or less comfortable, either.\n\nThe new results show people can ask friends or relatives to help examine their bodies for suspicious moles, said Robinson.\n\n“That’s a simple enough statement, and people are not put off by that,” she said.\n\nBringing this program into the mainstream presents some challenges, however. Each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months.\n\n“We are now trying to see if people can learn, perform and have continuing confidence without the physician reinforcement,” said Robinson.\n\nFor now, she said people can go to the American Academy of Dermatology's website to learn the steps - known as the ABCDEs - of finding melanoma (bit.ly/2h9zl0Y).""]",One downside to this story is the lack of independent sources.,"This is a bite-size but informative story from Reuters Health reporting new research that assessed the confidence levels and feelings of embarrassment in people helping melanoma survivors to look for suspicious moles in hard-to-see body parts.

The devices are already in use at some comprehensive stroke centers across the United States, and three designs are approved here.\n\nBut many centers, citing mixed findings on the devices’ benefits, have either abandoned or have been reluctant to offer the treatment, which is costly and complex to provide. Insurers also have been skeptical of the procedure’s value, and many refuse to pay for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of two of the clinical trials were published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at an international conference on stroke in Nashville. Two more studies described at the meeting offered further confirmation of the clot-retrieval devices’ benefits.\n\nThe new studies were hailed by some as “game changers” in stroke care: UCLA stroke specialist Dr. Sidney Starkman said the presentations were greeted with standing ovations among neurologists and neurosurgeons at the conference.\n\nAt UCLA’s Stroke Center, Starkman said, “we’ve seen how well it works and have a team and a system that’s really ready” to provide intra-arterial stroke treatment. “We were enthusiastic all along and wanted to get others to do the same.”\n\nThe new research is expected to usher in more widespread use of clot-grabbing technologies at stroke centers across the nation. It comes just a year after a three widely cited studies — also published in the New England Journal of Medicine — failed to show benefits for stroke patients who got the additional therapy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the two large studies published Wednesday, researchers showed that more careful selection and speedy treatment of patients who got intra-arterial therapy yielded clearer evidence of the treatment’s benefits.\n\nIn both of the large clinical trials — one conducted in Canada, the United States, South Korea, Ireland and Britain, and the other in Australia and New Zealand — stroke patients needed to arrive at a participating hospital with a portion of their brain still undamaged by the lack of blood flow. Each of the hospitals performed extensive radiological scans to assess the extent of damage to the brain and locate and evaluate the size of the clot.\n\nTreatment also had to come quickly. The use of alteplase, a clot-dissolving medication also known as tPA, is limited to otherwise healthy patients who arrive at a hospital within 3 to 4.5 hours of stroke onset. In the Australia/New Zealand study, treatment with a clot-retrieving device had to be initiated within six hours of the onset of stroke symptoms and completed within eight hours.\n\nCompared with the 35 stroke patients who got clot-dissolving medicine alone, the 35 who got the two-pronged treatment were nearly twice as likely to regain some neurological function after three days. Imaging results revealed that for those who got both treatments, 100% of the brain tissue initially affected by a clot had blood flowing to it after 24 hours. Among the subjects who only got alteplase, the median level of restored blood flow was 37%.\n\nIn the other study, involving 238 stroke patients treated with alteplase, 90% of those who were also treated with an intra-arterial device were still alive 90 days later and 53% were considered functionally independent. Among the rest, 81% survived to 90 days and 29% were functionally independent.\n\nBoth clinical trials were ended early when it became clear that the dual therapy was superior to clot-dissolving medication alone.\n\n“These are overwhelmingly, unequivocally positive numbers,” said Dr. J Mocco, director of cerebrovascular surgery for Mt. Sinai Health System in New York City. The studies suggest that, on average, for every 2.5 to 4 patients treated with intra-arterial therapy, one could be expected to have an outcome better than they would have had with alteplase alone.\n\n“This is radically better than anything we’ve had,” said Mocco, who was not involved with either trial. The studies’ ethnically diverse patient population also means the findings are likely to be widely applicable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, Mocco cautioned that few U.S. hospitals — including those with specialized stroke centers — were ready to offer intra-arterial stroke treatment.\n\n“There are a great many centers that will report they have the capability to provide these services,” he said. “But there are truthfully relatively few that have put in the effort and expertise to create the comprehensive team-based work flow needed to rapidly evaluate and treat these patients safely and efficiently.”\n\nIn the United States, three clot-retrieval devices are approved for marketing. Two are designed to capture a clot in a mesh pouch: the Solitaire Flow Restoration stent retriever made by Covidien and the Trevo stent device made by Stryker Corp. The third is the Penumbra thromboaspiration device from Penumbra Inc., which suctions up a blood clot instead.\n\nThe Canada-led trial was funded in part by the University of Calgary, Alberta Health Services and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. The Australia/New Zealand trial was paid for by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Royal Melbourne Hospital Foundation and the Heart Foundation of Australia. Both trials also received financial and infrastructure support from Covidien, the maker of one of the devices.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @LATMelissaHealy']","This story delivers most of what readers need to know about four new studies of stroke treatment — even if it does, at times, get a bit caught up in the excitement surrounding the results.","This is an example of good medical reporting.

""These findings are the first example of a precision therapy that is uniquely effective in a subgroup of patients with treatment-resistant COPD.""\n\nCOPD, a progressive lung disease characterized by airway obstruction and chronic lung inflammation, affects 30 million Americans.\n\n""There is significant variation between patients in the cells and other proteins responsible for lung inflammation, so there are actually many different subtypes of COPD,"" said Sciurba.\n\nOne subgroup called eosinophilic predominant COPD is present in as many as 40 percent of patients and is characterized by elevated levels of a type of white blood cell known as eosinophils, he said.\n\nThe new study reports the results from two Phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of mepolizumab, an antibody treatment that reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood, in moderate to severe treatment-resistant eosinophilic COPD by blocking the pro-inflammatory effects of interleukin-5.\n\nPatients included in the trials were still having flare-ups despite a year of a standard treatment known as ""triple inhaled therapy"" that includes bronchodilators and glucocorticoids.\n\n""These patients already have been given every treatment we have to offer them and are still having flare-ups that significantly interfere with their quality of life and can lead to deterioration in lung function and higher mortality,"" said Sciurba. ""We hoped to be able to offer them an option.""\n\nMepolizumab is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce symptom flare-ups and improve quality of life in eosinophilic asthma.\n\nThe first trial, termed METREX, was conducted at 117 sites in 15 countries from 2014 to 2017. A total of 837 COPD patients were stratified by blood eosinophil counts and randomized to receive either 100 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, delivered under the skin every four weeks for one year.\n\nThe patients with high eosinophil counts who received mepolizumab had a statistically significant 18 percent lower rate of moderate/severe exacerbations (1.4 per year compared to 1.7 per year) than those in the placebo group. The exacerbation rate in the low eosinophil group treated with the biologic did not differ from placebo. The time to the first exacerbation also was higher with mepolizumab than placebo, but only in the high eosinophil group.\n\nIn a second, simultaneous trial, termed METREO, the team assessed the effect of a higher dose of mepolizumab in 675 patients with elevated eosinophil levels. Patients were randomized to receive 100 or 300 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, with the same delivery method and schedule as METREX.\n\nSimilar to METREX, the exacerbation rate was reduced by 20 percent in the high eosinophil group after 100 milligrams of mepolizumab. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose.\n\nAn analysis of data from both trials found that as baseline blood eosinophil counts increased, so did mepolizumab\'s reduction in the annual exacerbation rate. This finding indicates that patients with higher initial eosinophil counts benefited more from mepolizumab than those with lower eosinophil counts, Sciurba said. The safety profile of mepolizumab did not differ from placebo in either trial.\n\n""In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD,"" Sciurba said.\n\nPitt\'s Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine has a legacy of pioneering treatments for lung disease. UPMC also is home to a leading lung transplant program.\n\n""The findings in these trials exemplify what we hope to achieve not only in COPD but across all lung diseases with regards to a precision approach to treatment,"" said division chief, Rama Mallampalli, M.D.\n\n###\n\nFunding for both trials was provided by GlaxoSmithKline, which plans to seek approval from the FDA for the use of mepolizumab in eosinophilic COPD.\n\nAdditional authors on the study are Ian Pavord, F.Med.Sci.

Patients with a higher level of eosinophils face more frequent flare-ups that can send them to the hospital or emergency room. The release does a number of things well. It provides some numerical data to back up its claims of efficacy and does a good job of disclosing the commercial interests involved in funding the study. However, the release doesn’t mention the high cost of the drug or any possible side effects of its use. Moreover, the most useful information about the extent of the benefit provided is buried toward the bottom of the release.

Botox injections are also used, often in cases where the medicine does not work.\n\nNow a placebo-controlled study has found that the treatments are equally useful in reducing the frequency of episodes of incontinence, but vary in side effects and long-term effectiveness.\n\nResearchers randomly assigned 241 women with urinary incontinence to daily medicine and a placebo injection, or a Botox injection and a daily placebo pill.\n\nThe scientists, writing online on Oct. 4 in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that both treatments significantly reduced incontinence episodes. Dry mouth was much more common in those who took the medicine; urinary infections and incomplete emptying of the bladder were more common in those given Botox. Significantly, those who took Botox were more likely to have their symptoms completely disappear.\n\nThe medicine has to be taken daily, while Botox is given in a single injection that is effective for about 6 to 12 months.\n\n“These are both effective treatments,” said the lead author, Dr. Anthony G. Visco, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke. “This gives patients the information to make an informed decision.

Researchers set out to determine if this phenomenon, called the ""Mozart Effect,"" played a role in the detection rates of precancerous polyps during colonoscopies.\n\nIn their small study, two doctors performed endoscopies either while listening to Mozart or with no music at all. Both doctors improved their detection rates of potentially dangerous adenomatous polyps when they listened to music compared with their pre-study (""baseline"") rates, the investigators found. But while both doctors had better results compared to their baseline rates, one doctor did slightly better in procedures without music than with music during the study.\n\nDetection rates for the first doctor were about 67 percent while listening to music and 30 percent with no music. This was up from a baseline detection rate of 21 percent before the study began.\n\nHowever, the second doctor had an adenoma detection rate of nearly 37 percent with Mozart and 40 percent without the music, compared with a baseline detection rate of 27 percent.\n\n""Both endoscopists had higher adenoma detection rates listening to music when compared with their baseline rates,"" lead researcher Dr. Catherine Noelle O\'Shea, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said in an American College of Gastroenterology news release.\n\nThe study authors suggested that the findings could help reduce the number of people affected by invasive colorectal cancer -- the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and women in the United States, according to background information in the news release. When spotted early, potentially dangerous polyps can be removed during colonoscopies, preventing the development of disease.\n\n""Adenoma detection rate is linked to a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence, so it is an important quality indicator for colonoscopy,"" said O\'Shea. ""Anything we can do to get those rates up has the potential to save lives. While this is a small study, the results highlight how thinking outside the box -- in this case using Mozart -- to improve adenoma detection rates can potentially prove valuable to physicians and patients.""\n\nThe study was slated for presentation Monday at the American College of Gastroenterology\'s annual meeting in Washington, D.C.

Without intervention, 80 to 90 percent of infants who are born to mothers infected with hepatitis B develop a chronic infection. The current standard of care is to provide vaccine and immune globulin to reduce transmission rates.\n\n“Preventing mother-to-child transmission is the most effective way to reduce the global burden of chronic hepatitis B infection and liver cancer,” says Calvin Pan, MD, lead author of the study and a clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone. “We believe that these findings will not only save many lives, but could also help to eradicate hepatitis B nationally and abroad.”\n\nThe study was conducted in five locations in China, where HBV infection is endemic. Pan and colleagues enrolled 200 pregnant women with a high “viral load,” defined as one million copies of the virus per milliliter in a blood sample. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group that received no antiviral therapy, or to a second group that received a daily dose of 300 milligrams of tenofovir in pill form, beginning at 30 or 32 weeks of pregnancy and continuing until 4 weeks after delivery.\n\nTreatment effectively reduced the viral load of the pregnant women, says Pan. Before delivery, 68 percent of tenofovir-treated mothers had HBV loads below 1 million copies per milliliter, compared to 2 percent of nontreated mothers.\n\nIn terms of safety, researchers found that tenofovir was well tolerated; only one participant treated with tenofovir voluntarily withdrew from the study due to nausea. Among the children born during the study, Pan and his colleagues found no significant differences between the tenofovir-treated group and the control group with regard to fetal development and infant growth.\n\n“This study provides strong evidence on how best to care for women infected with hepatitis B during pregnancy and reduce the rate of disease transmission,” says Mark Pochapin, MD, the Sholtz/Leeds Professor of Gastroenterology and director of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at NYU Langone.\n\nBased on the findings, the investigators recommend that women be tested for HBV viral load at week 28 of pregnancy. Those with a high viral load should receive tenofovir treatment starting at gestational week 30 until delivery to reduce the risk of transmission to their infants. In addition, infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine and immune globulin. Moving forward, longer term, observational studies are needed to confirm the safety of fetal exposure to tenofovir treatment, says Pan.\n\nThis research was supported by Gilead Sciences.\n\nDr. Pan’s co-authors were Zhong Ping Duan at Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, in Beijing; Er Hei Dai and Bao Shen Zhu at Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang; Shu Qing Zhang and Wen Jing Zhao at Hepatobiliary Disease Hospital of Ji Lin Province, Changchun; Guo-Rong Han and Hong-Xiu Jiang at Second Affiliated Hospital of Southeast University, Nanjing; Yuming Wang at Institute for Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing; Huai Bin Zou at Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing; and Huai Hong Zhang at Nanyang Center Hospital, Nanyang, Henan, all for the China Study Group for the Mother-to-Child Transmission of Hepatitis B.\n\nMedia Inquiries\n\nRob Magyar\n\nPhone: 212-404-3591\n\nrobert.magyar@nyumc.org']",Otherwise carefully written release on hepatitis B treatment omitted cost,"This news release describes a clinical trial testing whether an antiviral drug given to pregnant women in their third trimester reduces their hepatitis B viral load. The study also examined whether the drug limits the transmission of the virus from mother to baby. The answers to both questions are yes, suggesting a new strategy for dealing with the spread of this disease.
The release does a good job describing harms, quantifying benefits and describing the study protocol. Because the cost of hepatitis drugs has been widely debated for the past few years, a mention of the drug’s cost would have made the release stronger.

The researchers then found a comparison group of women without the disease, who matched the first group in age, ethnicity and clinics where they received treatment.\n\nEarlier studies have found that women taking bisphosphonates have a lower risk of breast cancer. But it was unclear if that effect could be chalked up to the drugs, because the condition they are meant to treat — bone thinning, or osteoporosis — is tied to low estrogen levels, which also cuts breast cancer risk.\n\nColon cancer, on the other hand, has not been linked to estrogen, said Dr. Gad Rennert of the Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, whose findings are published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nHis team found that women who had been taking bisphosphonates — mainly the drug alendronate (Fosamax), which costs around $10 per month in the U.S. — for at least a year had a considerably lower risk of developing colon cancer later on.\n\nEven after considering other factors tied to the disease — like aspirin or statin use and eating lots of vegetables — their risk was 59 percent lower than that of women who hadn’t taken the drugs.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, one in 19 men develops colorectal cancer at some point, and slightly fewer women do. The disease is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.\n\nRennert said in an e-mail that alendronate is used by millions of women across the globe and has few side effects. The long-term effects are less well-known, however, and in rare cases it can cause bone death of the jaw, which would be important if healthy people were to take it.\n\nAlso, not all patients asked to participate in the study agreed, which could limit the results further.\n\nJacobs of the American Cancer Society added that one earlier study from the UK had found no link between bisphosphonate and colon cancer. Indeed, it found a higher risk of throat cancer in patients on the medication.\n\n“Based on current evidence, bisphosphonates should not be used for prevention of colorectal cancer,” Jacobs said. “Fortunately, there are proven ways to help prevent colorectal cancer. In particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/aaGhWR Journal of Clinical Oncology, online February 14, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The difference between this story and the <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3634"" target=""_blank"">HealthDay story</a> we reviewed on the same topic can be see in the first quotes each story chose. This one led with caution, the other not so much. </span>","Reuters Health quoted Eric Jacobs from the American Cancer Society saying, “The lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing….However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies.” From that point on, the story took a cautious, objective look at the study’s findings. The HealthDay story, by contrast, quoted Dr. Gad Rennert, the study’s lead author, sounding effusive: “These [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers. … This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins.” From there on, Rennert is allowed to pump up the benefits of these drugs and to sweep aside any concern about their risks or broad application to a large population. The HealthDay story did hit some of our marks, too, but, overall, Reuters Health did a better job putting this study in the proper context. In addition, you can’t judge the stories by their headlines. The Reuters headline, “Women on bone drugs have less colon cancer” is not an accurate overview of the study’s finding.

The P-Cure system is based on a diagnostic-quality computed tomography (CT) enabling treatment planning, positioning and treatment delivery for cancer patients in a seated position.\n\nThe P-Cure Patient-Centric solution is a paradigm shifting change from the current method of treatment with the patient in the horizontal position.\n\n“The benefits of treating patients in a seated position include greater patient comfort, less internal organ movement, better saliva drainage and a better position for breathing for asthmatic and other patients experiencing impaired breathing. It may also deliver less collateral radiation to sensitive organs while enabling greater accuracy in proton beam delivery,” said Michael Marash, Ph.D., founder and CEO of P-Cure.\n\nAdult and pediatric patients who will initially benefit from this clinical breakthrough will be those treated for cancers of the lung, breast, chest, the head and neck, and lower torso.\n\nIn addition to the clinical benefits of P-Cure’s solution, there are also significant economic advantages to treating patients in a seated position. With P-Cure, oncologists can develop a compact, gantry-less proton center for significantly less capital and operating costs, essentially making proton therapy more widely available and attainable.\n\nBecause of the high capital costs, proton therapy is currently only available to less than one percent of patients who could potentially benefit from it.

We’re fully prepared to believe that there are ways to more accurately administer proton beam therapy with fewer side effects and lower costs. This release makes just those claims and yet provides nothing to back the claims up. There is no quantification of benefits. No true exploration of risks. No explanation of the quality of the evidence. And no true comparison of alternatives.

Months later, he shocked the world again by releasing a statement teasing he was in remission. He said a bit more before a videotaped Sunday school class he led, noting an immunotherapy drug called pembrolizumab — known better as Keytruda — was part of his treatment alongside surgery and radiation. (See our previous coverage: What the media got wrong about Jimmy Carter’s cancer cure.)
NBC News has followed the story since it broke last summer, and the outlet revisited it again on the coattails of a new study on Keytruda, published April 19, 2016 in JAMA. NBC News’ latest story was also accompanied by a 2-minute video.
The stories together do a nice job of walking readers through the study’s numbers, how pembrolizumab might work, the side effects, costs, and other details. It also cites several researchers who weren’t involved with the study and addresses a key issue with hype by stating the study’s finding “doesn’t mean a cure.”
This vivid picture of success may set readers up for false expectations of benefit. Because as the story itself points out, a majority of patients treated with the drug didn’t live longer than three years.

Breast cancer afflicts 1 in 8 women in their lifetime and 1 in 25 die from this disease. Although a number of randomized trials demonstrate the clear benefits of mammography screening in women up to age 74 on reducing mortality, data are sparse in women over the age of 74, especially minorities. In 2010, 41 percent of breast cancer deaths occurred in the more than 19 million women who are between the ages of 65 to 84 years.\n\nIn a new study published in the American Journal of Medicine, Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., senior author and first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University, indicates that black and white women ages 75 to 84 years who had an annual mammogram had lower 10-year breast cancer mortality than corresponding women who had biennial or no/irregular mammograms.\n\nAmong elder women, the American Cancer Society and the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend regular mammography for ages 65 to 74.\n\nAlthough many guidelines rely on self-reports, Hennekens and his collaborators from Baylor College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College, used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program file linked to the Medicare administrative claims file, which allowed them to identify screening mammography use from 1995 to 2009 from 64,384 non-Hispanic women (4,886 black and 59,498 white). These linked files also permitted them to explore breast cancer mortality differences between elderly black or white women who self-selected for regular annual or biennial mammography screening. The researchers selected 69 as the lower age limit because Medicare coverage of the general population begins at age 65, and the exposure of interest was regular mammography screening in the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThree mutually exclusive categories were defined: no or irregular mammography; biennial mammography; and annual mammography. They looked at data from non-Hispanic, white or black women; Hispanics were not included because Hispanic white women have substantially lower mortality than non-Hispanic whites, and the number of Hispanic blacks is small. The researchers also measured socioeconomic status looking at median household income, the percentage of individuals living below the poverty level, and whether or not they had a high school education.\n\nOther significant findings from the study show that:\n\nWhite women who had died tended to be older, to have a later stage diagnosis, to have received chemotherapy, and to have a higher socioeconomic status.\n\nWhite women who died were less likely to have undergone surgery and receive radiation therapy.\n\nSimilar characteristics were seen in black women as in white women.\n\n69- to 84-year-old women receiving regular annual screening mammography during the four years immediately preceding breast cancer diagnosis had consistently lower five-year and 10-year risks of breast cancer mortality than women with no or irregular screening regardless of race.\n\n10-year risks were more than three times higher among white and more than two times higher among blacks aged 69 to 84 years with no or irregular screening compared with annual screening.\n\nHennekens notes that further research is needed, but that in the future, the use of regular claims-based surveillance for mammography as a source of data may offer some unique advantages over self-reports.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, according to Science Watch, Hennekens was the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former fellows and/or trainees. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives, which placed him two ahead of professor Jonas Salk ranked No. 83 for the development of the polio vaccine. In 2013, he received the ""Fries Prize for Improving Health"" and in 2014, he received the Alton Ochsner Award for his pioneering work on smoking and health. In 2015, he was ranked the No. 14 ""Top Scientist in the World"" based on his H-index of 173.\n\n###\n\nAbout Florida Atlantic University:']",This news release claims the evidence is in that regular mammograms after age 74 save lives. But does the evidence presented really show that?,"Researcher Charles H. Hennekens, MD looms large in this news release — perhaps larger than the study itself.
This news release issued on behalf of a prestigious researcher — one said to have “saved more than 1.1 million lives” according to Science Heroes — claims the evidence is in that regular mammograms after age 74 save lives. But does the evidence presented really show that?
We expected to see many different studies and opinions released when the USPTF announced its final recommendations on screening with mammograms, and we were not disappointed.
This release raises some important points but it also seems to be touting the professional reputation of the study’s senior author (ranked ahead of Jonas Salk in terms of lifesaving prowess!) when it should have devoted more space to cost and limitations, and making a stronger case for the benefits and evidence.

Sadler from Warwick\'s Department of Chemistry, researchers have developed a new line of attack against cancer: an organic-osmium compound, which is triggered using a non-toxic dose of sodium formate, a natural product found in many organisms, including nettles and ants.\n\nNamed JPC11, it targets a metabolic process which cancer cells rely on to survive and multiply. It does this by converting a key substance used by cancer cells to provide the energy they need for rapid division (pyruvate) into an unnatural lactate - leading to the cells\' destruction.\n\nUniquely, this chemo-catalyst treatment can be recycled and reused within a cancer cell to attack it repeatedly.\n\nThis unprecedented functional ability to recycle and reuse the compound within cancer cells could lead to future anticancer drugs being administered in smaller, more effective, and potentially less toxic doses - decreasing the side-effects of chemotherapy.\n\nThe researchers have been focusing on the potential to use this compound on ovarian and prostate cancers.\n\nOvarian cancers are becoming increasingly resistant to existing chemotherapy drugs (such as the platinum drug, cisplatin). Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity.\n\nImportantly, the development opens up a possibility for a more selective cancer treatment as JPC11 was observed to specifically target the biochemistry of cancer cells, leaving healthy cells largely untouched - another improvement compared to existing platinum-based drugs, which can also attack non-cancerous cells.\n\nDr James Coverdale, a Research Fellow from Warwick\'s Department of Chemistry, commented:\n\n""This is a significant step in the fight against cancer. Manipulating and applying well-established chemistry in a biological context provides a highly selective strategy for killing cancer cells.\n\n""We have discovered that chemo-catalyst JPC11 has a unique mechanism of action - and we hope that this will lead to more effective, selective and safer treatments in the future.""\n\nProfessor Peter Sadler, a medicinal chemist at the University of Warwick commented:\n\n""Platinum compounds are the most widely used drugs for cancer chemotherapy, but we urgently need to respond to the challenges of circumventing resistance and side-effects.

Chemo-catalysts, especially those with immunogenic properties, might provide a breakthrough.\n\n""It will take time to progress from the lab to the clinic, but we are fortunate to have a talented enthusiastic, international team working with colleagues in Warwick Cancer Research Centre across the borderlines of chemistry, cell and systems biology and cancer medicine who are determined to succeed.""\n\nProfessor Martin Wills, catalyst specialist at the University of Warwick, commented:\n\n""Although asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation processes are well developed in the materials industry, this research provides the first ever example of it being achieved inside cells using a synthetic catalyst.""\n\nHandedness (molecular asymmetry) is critical to the function of bio-molecules in the body. Proteins, enzymes and our DNA, for example - are handed. Only the correct hand works, in the same way that a right hand does not fit a left-hand glove.\n\nIn this case, the osmium compound JPC11, with sodium formate, can selectively produce a molecule of a specific \'handedness\' - thus manipulating how cancer cells grow.\n\nDr Coverdale explained:\n\n""The \'handedness\' of molecules is critical in the body. Our hands are near-identical, but are mirror images of each other. The same can be true of molecules, and in some cases, having the wrong handed molecule can have profound biological consequences.\n\n""We believe that manipulation of the \'handedness\' of molecules in cells could provide a new strategy for fighting diseases.""\n\n###\n\nNotes:\n\nThe research, \'Asymmetric transfer hydrogenation by synthetic catalysts in cancer cells\', is published in Nature Chemistry.

The news release focuses on a study published in Nature Chemistry Jan. 8, which found that a compound called JPC11, found in stinging nettle plants and ants, is effective at attacking some kinds of cancer cells. However, while the release explains how JPC11 can attack cancer cells, it does not tell readers of the many hurdles that lie between the current discovery and any possible future use of the compound to fight cancer in humans. The research published in Nature Chemistry reflects only work done testing JPC11 against some types of cancer cells in vitro. In other words, JPC11 has not yet been tested in an animal model, much less begun the lengthy process of clinical trials that are necessary to determine whether it may be used on a large scale by human patients.
The release acknowledges in a quote from a lead researcher that “It will take time to progress from the lab to the clinic” but the caution seems weak in comparison to the claims and speculation made elsewhere in the release, including in the headline.

""The pandemic influenza 2009 gave us the opportunity to evaluate a standard Chinese herb formula"" designed to target the flu, they added.\n\nCao and Wang, who specialize in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology, said the herbal recipe -- known as maxingshigan-yinqiaosan (M-Y) -- is easily accessible throughout China and much less expensive than Tamiflu (oseltamivir).\n\nHowever, finding the medicine in the United States is difficult, if not impossible, given that it contains the stimulant ephedra. The United States has banned or restricted the sale of ephedra products because of concerns about possible complications, such as heart attack, stroke and even death, related to its use as a weight-loss supplement.\n\nThe authors discuss their findings in the Aug. 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 (""swine flu"") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said.\n\nPer World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. However, it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world, such as rural China, where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment.\n\nThe M-Y flu preparation is composed of 12 herbs: ephedrae, zhimu, qinghao, shigao, yinhua, huangqin, chaoxingren, lianqiao, bohe, zhebeimu, niubangzi and gancao.\n\nTo compare the relative effectiveness of M-Y and Tamiflu in treating H1N1 influenza, the authors focused on 410 previously healthy patients who were diagnosed with a ""very mild"" form of the illness.\n\nThe men and women were relatively young, with an average age of 19. They were being treated in 11 different medical facilities across four Chinese provinces during the height of the pandemic, between July and November of 2009, to prevent spreading the flu, not because their symptoms were severe.\n\nWithin 72 hours of the onset of symptoms, the patients were assigned to one of four five-day treatment groups. One group was given 75 milligrams of Tamiflu twice a day in capsule form; a second group received 200 milliliters of M-Y four times a day in liquid form; a third group took the same dosages of Tamiflu and M-Y together; and a fourth group received no treatment.\n\nAll of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards.\n\nThe results: Both M-Y and Tamiflu were effective at eliminating fever, whether administered on their own or in combination.\n\nAll three approaches helped to resolve fever sooner than no intervention whatsoever, the authors said, noting it appeared that fever dissipated fastest when M-Y and Tamiflu were given together. However, none of the treatment methods appeared to be superior in terms of overall viral control, and side effects were minimal in all cases.\n\nEven though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.\n\nDuffy MacKay, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents the dietary supplement industry, believes that fears over ephedra\'s use as a weight-control agent have overlooked ""its more traditional and much safer"" role as a medicine against lung inflammation.\n\nMacKay said that in China, traditional medicine is ""seamlessly integrated"" into everyday medical practice.\n\n""Here in the U.S., we do things differently,"" he said. ""We have our prescription drugs on the one hand, and then we have dietary supplements on the other.""\n\nBut, MacKay continued, ""it should also be understood that these two treatments actually work very differently. Tamiflu works to stop viral replication. But the herbal formula is working on symptoms to help people become more comfortable. And those are two very different goals,"" he noted.\n\n""So our advice,"" MacKay added, ""is that because H1N1 can be very serious, it\'s very important to see your doctor. And once you\'re under the care of your licensed physician there\'s certainly a lot of things in the world of botanicals that might help.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on the flu and traditional medicine, visit the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Common shortcomings seen in this story:  failure to address costs, to adequately quantify benefits and to provide independent perspectives. </span>","This story was about a study comparing a Chinese herbal mixture to Tamiflu for the treatment of H1N1 flu (also called swine flu).

It also lacked crucial context that a truly independent observer might have provided — specifically, that the patients included in the study (healthy adults with very mild cases) are not the kind of people for whom Tamiflu makes a big difference, as these patients typically get better quickly on their own without treatment. What’s truly needed is an alternative treatment for patients with severe cases who don’t have access to antiviral drugs. This study gets us a step closer to determining whether this herb mixture might be effective for those patients, but it doesn’t address the question directly.

Such a treatment has been long sought.\n\nEven better, the newest one would appear unlikely to cost $690 a dose — unless drug makers are slow learners.\n\nFederal researchers, working with colleagues at 44 medical centers, found that administering vaginal progesterone to women with a short cervix — a risk factor for premature delivery — cuts the rate of delivering before 33 weeks by 45%.\n\nThe reduction applies only to women with a short cervix (between 1 centimeter and 2 centimeters), not for women at high risk for other reasons. But for these women, few medications have been found effective at keeping a baby in the womb longer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhysicians led by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., assigned 458 women with a short cervix to receive daily applications of either a progesterone gel or a placebo gel between the 19th and 23rd weeks of pregnancy.\n\nFewer women who got the progesterone treatment delivered early—8.9% versus 16.1% in the placebo group, the team reported online in the journal Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nFurther, there were indications the hormone might help the babies too. Fewer babies born to mothers given progesterone had respiratory distress syndrome, a lung disorder common to premature infants (3% versus 7.6%).\n\nThe data set isn’t very large: 21 of 235 women given progesterone delivered early compared with 36 of 223 women given a placebo. And, of course, the trial was funded by the maker of the progesterone gel, to be marketed as Prochieve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut giving progesterone gel to 14 women with short cervical length would appear to prevent one premature birth, and a progesterone gel the company already sells, Crinone, is FDA approved for women in some fertility treatments. The researchers used about $20 worth of the 8% strength of Crinone in each dose.\n\nThus, the findings are promising, especially when few drugs can keep a pregnant woman from delivering early.\n\nOne new drug, also progesterone-based, is marketed for women who have already had a spontaneous preterm birth. That drug, Makena, was the subject of considerable controversy recently after its manufacturer boosted the price from $20 per dose to $1,500 per dose before finally lowering it to $690.

Boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain’s immune cells, prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain’s of people with Alzheimer’s.\n\nThe authors caution that a “big if” remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.\n\n“If humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it’s so non-invasive, and it’s so accessible,” said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, and the paper’s senior author.\n\nAlzheimer’s research has faced a number of major setbacks – most recently the failure of Eli Lily’s drug trial – after promising results in rodents did not translate into clinical improvements for patients.\n\nThe latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined.\n\nThe study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, hinges on the observation that Alzheimer’s patients show a loss of synchronised brain activity, known as gamma oscillations, which is linked to attention and memory.\n\n\n\nTo restore the activity, the scientists first used mice that had been genetically engineered such that the neurons that generate gamma activity in the brain were sensitive to light. The technique, known as optogenetics, allowed the scientists to artificially cause groups of neurons to fire in unison by pulsing light into the brains of the mice.\n\n\n\nAfter an hour of stimulation, the researchers found a roughly 50% reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus, the brain’s memory centre. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain’s immune cells.\n\nIn a healthy brain, microglia act as chemical rubbish collectors, surveying the local environment, clearing up unwanted compounds, but in Alzheimer’s these cells can lose this function and switch into an inflammatory state in which they secrete toxic compounds instead. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.\n\nNext, the scientist showed that gamma oscillations could also be stimulated non-invasively in the visual brain region simply by exposing the mice to a flickering light. At 40Hz the flicker of the light is barely discernible and would be “not offensive at all” for a person to have in the background.\n\nAfter being given one hour of flickering light each day for a week, the scientists saw a 60% reduction of harmful amyloid plaques in the brains of the mice.\n\nEd Mann, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: “I was surprised, and it’s exciting, that such a simple stimulus can target a molecular pathway and have such an effect in an hour.”\n\nQuestions remain, however, about whether boosting gamma oscillations and sweeping amyloid plaques out of the visual brain region would help with memory, which is centred in the hippocampus, or broader cognitive abilities.\n\nDavid Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It is conceivable that changing brain cell rhythms could be a future target for therapies, but researchers will need to explore how light flickering approaches could not only reduce amyloid in the visual area of the brain but in those areas more commonly affected in Alzheimer’s.”\n\nThe authors suggest that it may be possible to take a multi-sensory approach, using a combination of flashing lights and vibrating chairs. Tsai and Ed Boyden, a colleague at MIT and co-author, have started a company called Cognito Therapeutics to pursue tests in humans.\n\nThere are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain and this figure is expected to reach 1 million by 2025. Earlier this year, dementia overtook heart disease as the leading cause of death in England and Wales.']","This is a study that is important for researchers, but one we think probably didn’t need a wide general audience in mainstream news publications.","This story describes a study in which genetically engineered mice were exposed to an hour of pulsing light daily for a week, with the result that certain toxins associated with Alzheimer’s disease were dramatically reduced in their brains.
The story suggests the flickering lights are an intriguing, non-invasive, and probably inexpensive idea that could hold promise for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in humans. There is a major disclaimer: “The authors caution that a ‘big if’ remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.”
This is a story that admits many of the limitations of the research it cites, but initially draws people in with a headline that promises much more than the research has so far delivered. The study cited was published in a top journal and could represent a meaningful step on the way toward innovative treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The operative word, however, is “could.” This research is years away from impacting human lives, if indeed the findings end up being relevant to humans at all–and that needed to be explained better.
Furthermore, the heavy use of medical terminology and a confusing explanation of the rationale behind the study could make it hard for many people to pick up on just how far from application the findings really are. This is a study that is important for researchers, but one we think probably didn’t need a wide general audience in mainstream news publications.

And a study out Monday finds that a regular program of physical activity reduces the time spent with mobility-limiting disability.\n\nResearchers took more than 1,600 sedentary people between 70 and 89 years old who had some functional limitations, but who could walk about a quarter of a mile in 15 minutes or less, unassisted by another person or a walker. (Canes were OK.)\n\nHalf of the participants got a health education program involving regular in-person sessions and some stretching exercises, while the other group was told to aim for 150 minutes of aerobic activity as well as strength, flexibility and balance training both at the study\'s facilities and at home. ""Walking was the cornerstone of the program,"" says Thomas Gill, a professor of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the study, which appears in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe study followed participants for about 2.7 years, and found that the physical activity program cut the amount of time that people spent with a ""major mobility disability"" — defined as being unable to walk a quarter mile — by 25 percent compared to the education program. Previous findings from the same study showed that the exercise program lowered the risk of becoming disabled in the first place; this one showed that it sped recovery from an episode of disability and lowered the risk of subsequent episodes.\n\n""They\'ve done a really nice job of showing the incredible power of physical activity,"" says Bradley Cardinal, a professor of kinesiology at Oregon State University who wasn\'t involved with the study. ""It\'s the secret ingredient to successful aging in terms of quality of life."" An editorial accompanying the study, by the University of California, San Francisco\'s Patricia Katz and the University of South Carolina\'s Russell Pate, also noted that people who engage in physical activity have a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, depression, cognitive impairment and functional decline.\n\nThe exercise program pretty closely followed the government\'s recommendations for all adults, including older ones: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, plus two strength sessions that hit all the major muscle groups.\n\nBut most Americans don\'t get that much exercise, and that becomes increasingly true as people age. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 28 percent of those 75 and up meet the recommendation for aerobic activity, and only 8 percent also did the suggested amount of strength training.\n\nCardinal says older adults need to realize that exercise can greatly improve their quality of life by maximizing function as long as possible. But he says that many believe that older age is for relaxing and that physical activity is somehow dangerous or unnatural. That belief ""is pervasive among older adults,"" he says, even though for many of them, meeting the minimum requirements ""is doable.""\n\nSemantics can help. ""We try to frame this as more physical activity than exercise,"" says Gill. ""We talk with older folks and many say, \'I can\'t exercise, but maybe I can become more physically active.\' "" Study participants were advised to ""start low and go slow,"" and some were even able to get rid of their canes after six months of exercise, which Gill says they found particularly rewarding.\n\nPhysicians can also help. ""Prescribing exercise may be just as important as prescribing medications — perhaps even more important in some cases,"" the editorial said. The authors called on medical schools to ""start preparing students to prescribe exercise as effectively as they prescribe statins, and for health systems to support physicians in addressing inactivity just as they provide support in addressing other health risks."" (The American College of Sports Medicine has an ""Exercise is Medicine"" initiative to help physicians integrate exercise recommendations into their treatment plans.)\n\nThere are also some basic behavioral strategies for getting yourself to get moving, no matter your age, including giving yourself an incentive to change and engineering your environment to encourage the activity.\n\nKatherine Hobson is a freelance health and science writer based in Brooklyn, N.Y. She\'s on Twitter: @katherinehobson']",We also wanted to see more specifics on the benefits measured by the study.,"This story focuses on a study showing that elderly persons recovering from a disability get back to normal 25 percent sooner if they participate in a program of physical activity including “150 minutes of aerobic activity as well as strength, flexibility and balance training” per week. It points out that “walking was the cornerstone of the program.”
While it described the program in helpful terms, the story was light on the study’s specific findings, and seemed to assume that all people in this age group would see comparable results. Also, we would have been more satisfied if the story had mentioned early on that people in this age group should consult with their physicians before undertaking any kind of exercise program.

This CNN story covers the FDA’s third-ever approval of a gene-editing treatment — Luxturna, which treats a rare eye condition that can lead to blindness — from the angle of its exorbitant cost. Treatment costs aren’t covered as often as they should be in the popular press, even though they can drive insurance premium hikes, high deductibles, and other healthcare costs, so this story is a refreshing outlier.
However, the article inadequately explains how the treatment is done, how well it works, and for how long — all crucial information when deciding whether an effectively $850,000 procedure is worth it. (Note: Many stories, including CNN’s, used “$425,000 per eye”–but treatment appears to be recommended for both eyes.)

Compliance with colonoscopy is low, since people don’t want to have one, and the overall cost per detection is high because most people are healthy, and even colonoscopy misses many tumors in the upper part of the intestine.\n\nExact Sciences now plans to enlist several thousand patients in a prospective trial designed to win the Food and Drug Administration’s approval. The trial will be completed in 2012 and the test, if approved, should be available shortly thereafter.\n\n“If widely used, and regularly, this test really does have the opportunity to eliminate colon cancer,” said Dr. David A. Ahlquist, a colon cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic and an adviser to Exact Sciences.\n\nThe practical value of the tests depends critically on details like their sensitivity, meaning the proportion of tumors that are detected, and their specificity, meaning how many of the positive results are in fact false alarms.\n\nExact Sciences reported in July that its test was highly sensitive and specific when applied directly to cells taken from tumors. But in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples, even though almost all the DNA comes from the bacteria of the gut. Just 0.01 percent of the DNA is human, and most of this is normal DNA, not the altered DNA of tumors.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This may be acceptable, given that the worst that will happen is that the patient will get an unnecessary colonoscopy.\n\n“With stool tests, you need a 90 percent specificity,” said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer expert at Johns Hopkins University who is also an adviser to the company. “Exact Sciences has gotten close to that. There’s a lot of hope for getting a stool-based test.”\n\nPromising results for the blood-based tests were reported this week at a meeting in Barcelona, Spain. Epigenomics said its test had a sensitivity of 86 percent and a specificity of 93 percent.\n\nProponents of each test note possible weaknesses of the other. Dr. Achim Plum, a vice president for Epigenomics, said that 30 to 40 percent of people have small polyps, but less than 10 percent of these ever become cancerous. The colon-based test may pick up too many of these, sending far too many people in for colonoscopy.\n\n“The health economics of such a test make no sense,” he said.\n\nBut the blood-based test may have a similar problem, since a positive signal could come from cancers anywhere in the body. If the patient is advised to take a whole body imaging scan, more false positives could be generated “so you end up doing more harm than good,” Dr. Vogelstein said.\n\nDr. Plum said that Epigenomics did not see its test as being necessarily in competition with the Exact Sciences test, because the blood-based test would be good alternative for people put off by stool testing.""]","Not good enough on some key criteria:  costs, evaluating the quality of the evidence, getting independent sources, and comparing the new approaches with existing alternatives.","Strengths:  Immediately, in the opening words, the story acknowledges that there is another DNA test in development that was reported on this week.

This can cause less blood to reach the brain and, in rare cases, may also trigger a stroke if plaque breaks off and becomes lodged in the small vessels in the brain.\n\n""Only a small minority of patients with carotid stenosis will suffer a stroke,"" said lead researcher Dr. Raffi Topakian, from the Academic Teaching Hospital Wagner-Jauregg in Linz, Austria.\n\nThe problem is identifying the patients at the highest risk for stroke, he said. Most patients with carotid stenosis can be managed with medications such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, blood pressure-lowering drugs and blood thinners such as aspirin, he added.\n\nBut those at highest risk may need a surgical procedure called an endarterectomy, which clears the carotid arteries of plaque.\n\n""We found with two ultrasound methods we could differentiate the patients who are at very low risk of suffering a stroke -- lower than 1 percent per year -- from patients at high risk of stroke -- higher than 8 percent per year,"" Topakian said.\n\nThe patients who are at high risk are candidates for surgery, he said. Endarterectomy is not recommended for most people with carotid stenosis since the problem can be managed with drugs and there are risks, including stroke, with the procedure, Topakian said.\n\nThose who would benefit from the ultrasound test are people with known carotid stenosis who are fit for surgery, Topakian said. ""If they are too sick or frail for surgery, it makes no sense to do the ultrasound,"" he said.\n\nIn addition, people at high risk for stroke are also candidates for ultrasound, Topakian said. This would include people with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or heart disease, he said. ""This test could be a good tool to identify the right patients for surgery,"" Topakian said.\n\nOf course, anyone with symptomatic carotid stenosis is a candidate for immediate surgery, Topakian said. Warning signs include transient ischemic attacks (TIAS), or mini-strokes, which cause no permanent damage but are often followed by a stroke within a few days.\n\nThe report was published in the Aug. 17 online edition of Neurology.\n\nFor the study, a research team led by Topakian followed 435 people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for two years.\n\nEach participant had an ultrasound to see if there were signs that a stroke might occur. These included tiny blood clots, which pass into the brain, and a type of plaque called echolucent plaque, which is fattier than other plaque and linked with an increased risk for stroke.\n\nAmong those in the study, 38 percent had the fattier-than-normal plaque, 17 percent had signs of blood clots and 27 percent had both the fattier plaque and blood clots, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, over the two years of the study, 10 people had TIAs.\n\nMoreover, people with the fattier plaque were more than six times more likely to have a stroke than those people without the plaque, and those with the fattier plaque and clots had a risk that was 10 times higher, Topakian\'s team found.\n\nNonetheless, some experts said that research suggests that patients with no symptoms are better off without the surgery.\n\nDr. Lars Marquardt,a professor of surgery at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany and co-author of an accompanying journal editorial, said surgery for people with asymptomatic carotid steno sis is done too frequently.\n\nMarquardt noted that the risks associated with the surgery are a lot higher than leaving the stenosis as it is and starting aggressive medical treatment.\n\n""Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis don\'t get the surgical procedure early enough, and patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have too many surgical interventions,"" Marquardt said.\n\nWhen treating asymptomatic carotid stenosis, Marquardt doesn\'t think the case has been made for distinguishing between high- and low-risk patients. Right now, the work done by Topakian\'s group is still ""experimental,"" he said.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Larry B. Goldstein, director of the Duke University Stroke Center, said that ""what remains uncertain is whether surgical intervention would result in an overall improvement in stroke-free survival.""\n\n""It is also unclear how optimal medical management [lifestyle changes in addition to anti-platelet medication and statins] would affect overall stroke and cardiovascular risk, and stroke-free survival,"" he said.\n\nBoth the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association currently recommend against general population screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, Goldstein noted.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on stroke, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""> An interesting story on an important topic.  Independent perspectives contributed a great deal. </span>","There were elements of this story that may have confused readers, but the money quotes from an independent expert helped clarify the take-home message:

And, in the case of colds, the probability of a cold was slightly less. The effects seemed to be strongest early on after birth,"" said study senior author Usha Ramakrishnan, an associate professor in the Hubert Department of Global Health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nRamakrishnan said it\'s probably too soon to recommend routine use of DHA supplements for pregnant women, because the findings weren\'t ""dramatic."" But, she added that the supplements did appear to be safe for pregnant women to take.\n\nResults of the study will be published online on Aug. 1, and are scheduled to appear in the September issue of Pediatrics. The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the March of Dimes Foundation.\n\nOmega 3 fatty acids are a class of nutrients considered essential for neural and retinal development during pregnancy. They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.\n\nTherefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.\n\nMore than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant. Treatment continued at least until the birth of the baby.\n\nRamakrishnan said Mexican women tend to be deficient in DHA, much like many American women are.\n\nThe babies were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and the mothers completed questionnaires about their babies\' health. To aid their recall, the mothers were also asked to keep a diary, recording any illness symptoms.\n\nBabies in the DHA group had a 24 percent drop in the odds of having a combination of cold symptoms at 1 month compared to babies whose mothers were given a placebo. Also at 1 month, babies whose mothers had gotten the DHA supplement had 26 percent shorter duration of cough, 15 percent less time with phlegm and 30 percent shorter duration of wheezing.\n\nAt 3 months, babies in the DHA group were also sick 14 percent less time. And, at 6 months, the babies whose mothers had DHA had shorter duration of fever, runny nose and breathing problems.\n\nAt times, however, babies in the DHA group experienced longer duration of rashes and vomiting, the study authors noted.\n\nRamakrishnan said that it\'s likely that DHA boosts infants\' immune response.\n\nDr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, ""We\'ve been recommending DHA intake in pregnant women for brain and nervous system development, and this study suggests another good reason to take DHA.""\n\nWu recommended that women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should ""start prenatal vitamins and DHA supplements about three months before pregnancy and then continue them throughout the pregnancy. If you\'re not taking them ahead of time, you may miss out on proper nutrition,"" she added.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA, and infant health from the March of Dimes.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">When the senior author of the study is quoted as indicating that the results were not “dramatic,” it might suggest that results of the study are not all that newsworthy.</span>","This is a story reporting on a recently published study comparing the health of infants born to mothers who did or did not receive DHA supplements during a later portion (i.e. starting at 18 – 22 weeks) of their pregnancy.  These results follow several other publications about these infants and how they compare, which is something that should have been included in the story to provide readers with a more complete picture about what is known.  The health benefits were reported as percent improvement rather than absolute differences, which means that it is not possible for readers to know the magnitude of the differences in order to consider whether they are meaningful or not.

But a team of researchers from the University of Cincinnati set out to explore other treatment options that focus more on the mind and less on pharmaceutical solutions.\n\nTheir study, published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, recruited nine participants who were diagnosed with anxiety disorders between 9 and 16 years of age. These conditions included generalized, social, and separation anxiety disorder as well as having a parent with bipolar disorder. Over the course of 12 weeks, each participant underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while they practiced mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, a wide range of theraputic techiniques that include meditation, yoga, and learning how to pay nonjudgmental attention to one\'s life.\n\n""These integrative approaches expand traditional treatments and offer new strategies for coping with psychological distress,” said the study’s co-author Sian Cotton, director of the UC\'s Center for Integrative Health and Wellness, in a statement. ""Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions promote the use of meditative practices to increase present-moment awareness of conscious thoughts, feelings, and body sensations in an effort to manage negative experiences more effectively.”\n\nPhoto courtesy of Pixabay, public domain\n\nChildren who are at a high risk for bipolar disorder or other anxiety disorders, such as the participants, often have poor coping skills when confronted by stress, and only a lucky few get help. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 80 percent of children with a diagnosed anxiety disorder and 60 percent of those diagnosed with depression do not receive treatment. Some mental health professionals have suggested that mindfulness exercises can help bridge the treatment gap, and there is some encouraging, if early, evidence showing that these techniques can be used to prevent relapses of depression or anxiety.\n\nCotton noted the anxiety of their patients was significantly reduced following treatment, and the more mindfulness they practiced, the less anxious they felt. Both findings reaffirm the potential that mindfulness therapy could bring to the table. If nothing else, it might allow people who would be reluctant to take medication more treatments to choose from. ""Increasingly, patients and families are asking for additional therapeutic options, in addition to traditional medication-based treatments, that have proven effectiveness for improved symptom reduction. Mindfulness-based therapies for mood disorders is one such example with promising evidence,"" said Cotton, adding the university is both studying and implenting these therapies.\n\nAfter the 12-week experiment, Cotton and his colleagues found mindfulness therapy increased neural activity in a part of the brain that plays in a role in processing cognitive and emotion information known as the cingulate. The therapy was also able to increase brain activity in the insula, a part of the brain that helps monitor how the body feels psychologically.\n\n""This raises the possibility that treatment-related increases in brain activity during emotional processing may improve emotional processing in anxious youth who are at risk for developing bipolar disorder,” said fellow co-author Dr. Jeffrey Strawn, a professor in UC\'s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, as well as director of the Anxiety Disorders Research Program, in a statement. ""The path from understanding the effects of psychotherapy on brain activity to the identification of treatment response is a challenging one, and will require additional studies of emotional processing circuits.”\n\nSource: Strawn JR, Cotton S, Luberto CM, et al.

The story does a good job of highlighting that these findings are preliminary, and that additional research is needed to determine how effective cognitive therapy may be as a treatment option for the general population. However, the story does not discuss the extent of the therapy’s benefits in this study, the availability and cost of such cognitive therapy for children, or whether the study participants were also being treated with medications while undergoing cognitive therapy.

The findings could be a significant step in treating people with resistant hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, the researchers said.\n\nThe technique -- called catheter-based renal denervation -- is minimally invasive. In it, doctors use a catheter inserted through the artery in the groin, which sends radio waves burning away nerve tissue around the arteries that feed the kidneys.\n\nThe procedure destroys nerves that help control and filter salt in the body and may be overactive in patients with high blood pressure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved its use.\n\nThe study was funded by medical device maker Medtronic. The findings were published Dec. 17 in the journal Circulation.\n\n""This is a very promising approach for managing medication-resistant hypertension,"" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n""High blood pressure is a major contributor to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and [kidney] failure,"" said Fonarow, who was not involved in the study. ""Despite the availability of a number of effective medications, many patients with hypertension have not achieved adequate control of their blood pressure. There is thus an important, but currently unmet, need for additional therapies to effectively control hypertension.""\n\nFor the study, an international team lead by Dr. Murray Esler, professor and senior director of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, assigned 35 patients to renal denervation and compared them to 47 patients who had already had the procedure.\n\nAll the patients suffered from drug-resistant hypertension. Their systolic blood pressure -- the top number in a blood-pressure reading -- remained dangerously high at 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above despite having taking three or more drugs to control blood pressure, the researchers noted.\n\nEsler\'s team found that more than 83 percent of those who had denervation treatment before had a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after six months and almost 79 percent maintained the reduction at 12 months.\n\nThe 35 patients in this phase of the study had similar results to the initial group. Almost 63 percent of these patients saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more six months after treatment.\n\nFonarow noted: ""In all, reductions in systolic blood-pressure levels on the order of 25 to 30 mmHg were achieved and maintained without any loss in efficacy.""\n\nThe procedure is safe as well as effective, the study authors said.\n\n""Participants\' kidneys were not damaged or functionally impaired,"" Esler said in a journal news release. ""We also found no ill effects on long-term health from the procedure.""\n\nWhether this technique might be useful in treating less severe high blood pressure hasn\'t yet been tested. If it is applicable, it could mean patients need not take blood-pressure drugs, Esler suggested.\n\nAnother expert, however, said that scenario is likely overoptimistic.\n\n""Hypertension is a hard disease to treat because there are so many things that go into getting blood pressure under control,"" said Dr. Varinder Singh, chairman of cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""There\'s lifestyle and diet, there is getting to the right doses of medications, there are adherence issues. So anything that will help patients get their goals is exciting.""\n\nEven with this technique, people will most likely still have to take blood-pressure medications, Singh said. ""You may have to take less medication and you may have to take lower doses of medication, but we all expect that patients will still have to take some medication,"" he said.\n\nSingh also noted that although this procedure is used in other countries it is not yet approved in the United States.\n\nFonarow added: ""While this study demonstrates that renal denervation provides sustained reduction of blood pressure up to one year and appears safe, additional studies with longer-term follow-up are needed.""\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association, more than 78 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure, which is blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nAmong these adults, about 9 percent have resistant hypertension, which means that even taking three or more medications to control their blood pressure, it remains higher than 140/90 mmHg.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about hypertension, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","While the story gets a relatively high grade, it got unsatisfactory scores on 3 of our most important criteria:  costs, harms, and evidence.","At least  this story was better than the Toronto Star story, which led, “In what’s being described as a potential public health miracle….” and better than some recent Star Tribune stories on renal denervation.

Why doctors need to distinguish and how they might do so,"['Alzheimer’s disease now affects an estimated 5.5 million Americans, and after decades of feverish work, researchers have so far failed to find a treatment that halts or reverses the inexorable loss of memory, function and thinking ability that characterize this feared illness.\n\nBut researchers have been quite successful at devising ways to diagnose Alzheimer’s earlier and earlier. And that capability has emerged alongside evidence of a tantalizing possibility: that if you can catch the disease early enough — ideally when symptoms of confusion or memory loss are just emerging, or before — some therapies already in hand might essentially halt its progress.\n\nFor anyone who detects some mental slippage and wonders, “Is it Alzheimer’s?” the current state of dementia research raises a very real, and very wrenching, dilemma: If I can know, do I want to know?\n\nThat is, if it’s Alzheimer’s disease, would I do anything differently? Would there be some benefit in knowing for my loved ones, for myself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoctors and insurers, including the federal government, which administers Medicare, are asking some variants of the same questions: If an effective test, which costs between $3,000 and $5,000 a shot, can diagnose dementia early, and distinguish Alzheimer’s from other forms of dementia, should it be recommended to patients with cognitive concerns and routinely covered by their insurance? Would it make patients’ lives better, or lower the cost of their care?\n\nNewly unveiled research results are bringing some clarity to such deliberations. And other new research, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, proposes a new diagnostic tool that may be able to detect Alzheimer’s, and distinguish it from another form of dementia, more simply and cheaply than does the best test now available.\n\nAt the Alzheimer’s Assn. International Conference in London last week, researchers reported their preliminary findings from a trial that is testing the impact of diagnostic testing for Alzheimer’s disease on nearly 19,000 Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nAll of these study participants — largely people in their 70s, all with a diagnosis of either “mild cognitive impairment” or atypical dementia — are living with the unconfirmed suspicion that they have Alzheimer’s. The study is underwritten by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Alzheimer’s Assn. It set out to find out whether knowing — getting the costly test that would offer either confirmation or reprieve — would change the way that patients with cognitive troubles are treated, or the way that they plan their lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe preliminary results suggested it did. After getting the results of a PET brain scan to detect and measure amyloid deposits, which are the key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, roughly two-thirds of the subjects saw their medication regimens changed or were counseled differently by their doctors about what to expect.\n\nThat new information may have guided family caregivers in planning their own futures, or prodded patients to make financial decisions and power-of-attorney assignments sooner. Some who learned that they did not have Alzheimer’s discontinued medications that can have unpleasant side effects. Others learned they do have Alzheimer’s and decided to enroll in clinical trials that will test new drugs.\n\nA second study presented in London analyzed data from several studies, and found that in a large population of research participants with cognitive concerns, brain amyloid PET scans led to a change in diagnosis in approximately 20% of cases.\n\n“People should know what’s coming,” said Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer’s Assn. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has given amyloid scans a provisional approval, meaning they do not routinely pay for them. The results may guide the agency to rethink its position, she added.\n\nThe PET scan bore bad news for Ken Lehmann, who enrolled last year in the IDEAS trial, short for Imaging Dementia — Evidence for Amyloid Scanning. After his long, slow decline that has flummoxed doctors, Lehmann’s brain scan clearly showed he has Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nThe certainty that has brought has been a long time coming. When Lehmann began withdrawing from friends, forgetting to pay bills and having trouble following conversations, he was just 58. Now, he’s 80.\n\nKen had always been considered a “Renaissance man” — a furniture company executive who rebuilt Porsches, played basketball and loved to entertain friends, said his wife, Mary Margaret Lehmann. But as years passed, his judgment seemed off. He would lose track of points he was making, and sometimes of where he was at.\n\nIt would take the loss of their home and a business bankruptcy for the Lehmanns to demand answers to what was going on. In 2009, they moved from Sacramento to Edina, Minn., to live with a daughter. And there, at last, they found a neurologist who, despite initial skepticism (“but he presents so well!” the doctor proclaimed), diagnosed dementia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the Lehmanns and many patients and families like them — as well as for neurologists — that diagnosis is often just the beginning of a deeper mystery.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is the most feared and most common form of dementia, accounting for between 60% and 80% of all dementia cases diagnosed. But at least seven other forms of dementia, and dementia linked to the movement disorder Parkinson’s disease, can cause loss of memory, reasoning, judgment and the ability to speak, comprehend and care for oneself.\n\nTo the estimated 16 million Americans living with some form of cognitive impairment, telling the difference could make a significant difference. Dementia forms with different origins progress differently (or sometimes not at all). They respond best to different medications, and will come to require different levels of care and treatment. Some (though not Alzheimer’s) can even be reversed with treatment.\n\nBeing able to distinguish which form of dementia a patient has should help doctors and caregivers to make better choices.\n\nBut it’s a question that until recently could be answered only after death. At that point, a postmortem examination of the brain could be done to look for the built-up clumps and tangles of beta-amyloid proteins, the overall shrinkage, and the loss of neurons in the brain’s hippocampus that are, collectively, the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.\n\nNo more. Improved medical imaging technologies developed over the last decade have made it possible to peer inside the brain of a living patient, detect and measure the accumulation of beta-amyloid, and make a definitive diagnosis.\n\nIn 2012, the Food and Drug Administration took a first step in making such imaging possible, giving its blessing to the imaging agent florbetapir F18, which binds to amyloid aggregates in the brain and allows a PET scan to be used to make the diagnosis. In 2013, two new imaging agents won FDA approval, and new imaging agents and techniques promise ever more precise means to visualize and diagnose Alzheimer’s in the brain.\n\nOn Wednesday, research published in the journal Neurology suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation, a technique that can selectively turn up or down activity in different parts of the brain, could prove useful in distinguishing between Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn many ways, Ken Lehmann’s symptoms fit neatly into a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. A form of cognitive impairment that typically becomes evident earlier than most cases of Alzheimer’s, FTD often affects judgment, personality and verbal communication. This form of dementia progresses as inexorably as does Alzheimer’s. But its typical course differs slightly.\n\nAs an enrollee in the IDEAS trial, Lehmann was prepared to learn what it was he had.\n\n“I had come to the conclusion they just don’t know,” said Lehmann, now 80, from his home in Minnesota. “In seven years, my journey of decline has been very miniscule, and they don’t know why.”\n\nIt turns out, he added, “I have all the biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nOnce he and his wife learned that, they stepped up their preparations for further decline. And they redoubled their efforts to do things that bring joy, and that may slow Ken’s decline as well.\n\nThey follow a diet rich in fatty fish, healthful fats and fruits and vegetables, and Ken does woodworking. He also sings in a Minneapolis chorus, Giving Voice, with other dementia patients. He has regained a long-lost ability to read music.\n\n“Just not knowing is very disconcerting,” says Mary Margaret, who is her husband’s principal caregiver. “I don’t know what the timeline is, but I now know what the needs are, in terms of financial and legal needs and end-of-life issues. Those all need to be planned for ahead of time, and now we have all of that in place. To me, that’s a safety net.”\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\n@LATMelissaHealy\n\nMORE IN SCIENCE\n\nCTE was nearly ubiquitous among former NFL players who donated their brains to science\n\nTo preserve mental acuity into old age, experts suggest focusing on these three things\n\nFake news about statins is discouraging the use of these life-saving drugs, expert warns\n\nPlastic trash could top 13 billion tons by 2050.

This Los Angeles Times story broaches the tricky terrain of improving dementia and Alzheimer’s diagnostics in a world where there are no treatments that effectively stop or reverse the disease. Still, researchers want to know how doctors and patients might change their treatment decisions with more refined knowledge that expensive PET scans can provide. The story explores three new studies within that frame with care. And yet, the findings were described only in very general terms, and the story doesn’t discuss the downsides of this screening test (such as the risk of a false positive result).

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don\'t need. Nearly one in three adults in the U.S. has prehypertension, blood pressure higher than normal but not considered high yet.\n\nThe scans detect levels of calcium in the heart\'s arteries, and the physicians suggest those people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment, whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively, depending on their other heart disease risk factors.\n\nIn the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient.\n\n""If a health care provider wants to target blood pressure in a patient with traditional heart disease risk factors and above-normal blood pressure, he or she can look at coronary artery calcium to help with tiebreakerlike decisions,"" says J. William McEvoy, M.B.B.Ch., M.H.S., assistant professor of medicine and member of the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""Our study, along with others, such as SPRINT and HOPE, positions cardiac risk and coronary artery calcium as helpful ways to determine if a given patient would either benefit from more intensive blood pressure control or do just fine with a more traditional blood pressure target.""\n\nIn late 2015, the SPRINT trial showed improved outcomes for participants with increased risk for heart disease whose physicians targeted their systolic (the top number) blood pressures to 120 millimeters of mercury, rather than the traditional 140 millimeters of mercury. But not all people deemed ""higher risk"" by traditional methods may need to be aggressively treated, McEvoy says. Some people react poorly to higher doses of blood pressure medicines and experience side effects, such as sexual dysfunction, dizziness, falls, weakness and more. And the risk factor equations that determine whether certain people are at higher risk and should be treated more intensively with blood pressure medications may have inaccuracies on the individual level, says McEvoy. ""We can predict that about 15 out of every 100 people with a particular risk score will die of a heart attack, but the equations don\'t tell us which of those people will be one of the actual 15; they don\'t give us personalized information,"" says McEvoy.\n\nConventionally, coronary artery calcium scores have informed physicians\' decisions of whether to put a patient on statins, but the researchers say they haven\'t been evaluated before for their potential ability to determine blood pressure treatment. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Participants were an average of 65 years old, and 48 percent were men. Thirty-five percent were white, 32 percent were African-American, 22 percent were Hispanic and 11 percent were Chinese-American. At the beginning of the study, investigators measured their blood pressure and performed a cardiac CT scan to determine coronary artery calcium scores. They also calculated each participant\'s heart disease risk with the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Algorithm, which uses traditional risk factors, such as race, age, sex, cholesterol levels and family history of disease. About once a year for 10 years, an interviewer contacted each participant or a family member to determine heart disease diagnosis, hospitalizations or deaths. After about 10 years, the participants had 642 heart disease events, such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke and death.\n\nThe researchers divided the participants by their coronary artery calcium scores into one of three groups: those with a score of zero, those with a score of one to 100 and those with a score greater than 100. Then, they looked at the number of heart disease-related events in each calcium score category broken down by blood pressure range and calculated heart disease risk. Low heart disease risk was classified as a less than 15 percent chance of a heart disease event over the next 10 years, and high risk was 15 percent or greater risk of a heart disease event. To get the event rate, the investigators divided the number of events in each category by the amount of people in the study multiplied by the length of time they spent in the study, known as a person-year.\n\nParticipants with calcium scores of zero with a high calculated risk of heart disease had a relatively low actual event rate after the 10-year study. For example, according to the researchers, those with systolic blood pressures below 140 millimeters of mercury and no calcium had an event rate of 12.7 events per 1,000 person-years, and similar people with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 159 millimeters of mercury had an event rate of 13.6 events per 1,000 person-years.\n\nIn contrast, participants with systolic blood pressure under 140 millimeters of mercury -- below the current cutoff for treatment -- and rated with a low predicted risk of heart disease who had a calcium score over 100 had a high actual event rate of 19.7 events per 1,000 person-years. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment.\n\nParticipants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores. The researchers say this demonstrates that calcium scores may only be useful in guiding more personalized blood pressure treatment for patients with mild high blood pressure -- the gray zone -- not those with high blood pressure.\n\n""It may be that if patients are in that blood pressure treatment gray zone with a high risk score but their coronary artery calcium score is zero, then they don\'t need to be treated aggressively to 120 millimeters of mercury and can be treated to 140 instead,"" says McEvoy. ""But if patients have a high calcium score and are in the gray zone, then it would make sense to go with 120 as a treatment goal.""\n\nThe researchers caution that results are from an observational study, and a randomized trial would be needed to confirm the recommendations.\n\nCoronary artery calcium scans aren\'t usually covered by insurance and can range in cost from $100 to $400. The scans use radiation, so there is a very small cancer risk for susceptible individuals.\n\nAbout 70 million adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure -- a systolic blood pressure over 140 millimeters of mercury -- putting them at increased risk for heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and kidney disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n###\n\nAdditional authors on the study included Seth Martin, Zeina Dardari, Wendy Post, Khurram Nasir and Michael Blaha of Johns Hopkins; Michael Miedema of the Minneapolis Heart Institute; Veit Sandfort of the National Institutes of Health; Joseph Yeboah of Wake Forest Baptist Health; Matthew Budoff of the University of California, Los Angeles; David Goff of the Colorado School of Public Health; and Bruce Psaty of the University of Washington.\n\nThe study was funded by the P.J.

Doctors struggle to control it through off-label use of drugs like antipsychotics and anticonvulsants.\n\nAgitated patients yell, scream, pace and wander, she said. They also can become physically aggressive, striking out at people and hurting themselves or others.\n\n""You\'re going to find one in five outpatients with it. But when you get to the long-term care facilities, about 50 percent of inpatients will have agitation,"" Lanctot said. ""It\'s actually a big treatment challenge. The drugs we have now do not work very well and they\'re associated with an increase in mortality.""\n\nThe off-label drugs used to treat Alzheimer\'s are indeed a bit dodgy. For example, only one person out of five to 14 treated with antipsychotics actually experiences a decrease in agitation, Lanctot said. And for every nine to 25 people helped, one will die.\n\nBut Lanctot and her colleagues suspected that cannabinoids might help control agitation, given that natural cannabinoids in the brain decrease as Alzheimer\'s enters its advanced stages.\n\n""We know cannabis has several effects that might be good for people with agitation,"" Lanctot said. ""It has a calming effect. It helps with weight loss because it helps with appetite. It\'s also used for pain.""\n\nThe synthetic THC drug, nabilone, is approved in Canada for treating nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. It comes in capsule form.\n\n""It\'s a milder form of TCH"" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. ""We hoped it wouldn\'t have the side effects associated with cannabis, but would have the calming effects.""\n\nDuring the clinical trial, 39 patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\'s disease received nabilone for six weeks to treat their clinically significant agitation, followed by six weeks with an inactive placebo.\n\n""We had a significant decrease in agitation. The decrease we saw was larger than is seen with the currently used medications,"" Lanctot said.\n\nPatients underwent significant overall improvement in their other behavioral symptoms, and had small benefits in their brain function and nutrition during the study. Their caregivers also reported reduced levels of stress, according to Lanctot.\n\nThese benefits came with a downside, though. About 45 percent of patients experienced sedation with nabilone, compared with 16 percent for placebo, the findings showed.\n\nLanctot and Fargo do not recommend that relatives or friends of those with agitated Alzheimer\'s provide them medical marijuana to ease their suffering.\n\n""This trial tested a synthetic analog of THC. It\'s not THC, and it\'s certainly not whole-plant marijuana,"" Fargo said. ""There\'s virtually no data on whole-plant marijuana, whether or not it\'s effective or safe in people with Alzheimer\'s disease.""\n\nA form of synthetic THC is available in the United States, called dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol, Lanctot said. It\'s used as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and an anti-nausea remedy for chemotherapy patients.\n\nMarinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer\'s symptoms, Lanctot said. People interested in trying it should reach out to one of the big clinical trials; Johns Hopkins is one of the centers testing Marinol.\n\n""We wouldn\'t want to change clinical practice based on one study,"" Lanctot added.\n\nThe study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer\'s Association meeting in Chicago. Research presented at medical meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Alzheimer\'s Society has more about cannabis and Alzheimer\'s disease.']","However, the story didn’t provide any supporting numbers for the touted benefits.","This story summarizes the findings of a small Canadian study investigating whether a synthetic form of THC (the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) helps calm agitation in people with Alzheimer’s disease.

We also appreciated the overall cautious tone of this story, the clinical context of why agitation in Alzheimer’s disease is difficult to treat, and numbers that explain the frequency of the worrisome side effect of sedation.

Consider, for example, the many posts on The New York Times’ Well blog on the topic (walking versus running, the “right dose of exercise,” “walk hard, walk easy”), all of which focus on the relative benefits of walking versus jogging versus running.\n\nSo is it better to walk? To walk fast? To run slow? To run fast? On its face, this question is poorly posed, since it says nothing about our goals or our constraints. Am I aiming to lose weight? To live longer? To win road races? Am I willing to exercise for three hours a day? Twenty minutes? Almost never? Clearly, these considerations matter when trying to determine the optimal speed. Here is how I would think about asking the question instead: What is the easiest way to reduce my chance of death?\n\nTo analyze the impact of walking or running, researchers need a way to describe the effort exerted. The ideal measure would combine the length of time spent exercising with the amount of energy expended — basically, we want to figure out a way to credit people who walk at half the speed for twice as long the same amount as those who walk faster for less time.\n\nThe way researchers do this is with a measurement known as MET — metabolic equivalent of task — which gives a numeric value to various activities depending on their energy intensity. By multiplying an activity’s METs by the time you engage in it, you can get an overall measure of how much energy you expend.\n\nThe goal here is to use these METs and their relationship to health to analyze the value of walking compared with jogging or running. At least in this article, I won’t say anything about other kinds of exercise — no yoga or SoulCycle — though these have their own MET measures.\n\nLet’s first look at the results from two papers — here and here — that relate energy expenditures from walking (in MET hours per day) to the risk of death.\n\nDoing this analysis is a little complicated. You can’t look at the relationship between exercise and the chance of ever dying, because ultimately everyone dies. Instead, these studies look at whether exercise changes the risk of death at a given time. But since the people in the studies are of different ages, researchers can’t just look to see whether they have, say, a 2 percentage point lower risk of death in a given year, since that lower risk would mean a lot more for someone who is 30 than for someone who is 90. Results in these two papers — and basically all the others we’ll look at here — therefore report their results in “hazard ratios.” A hazard rate of 0.90, for example, means a 10 percent reduction in the risk of death. If there is a 10 in 1,000 chance you’ll die in the next year without exercise, this means by exercising you’d reduce that chance to 9 in 1,000.\n\nThis research shows that those who walk have a lower risk of mortality relative to people in the comparison group, who don’t walk for exercise at all (they probably do still walk some, just not for exercise). This risk of death is lower even with a very minimal energy expenditure. The lowest-energy-expenditure group in each study is walking at about 3 mph for 20 to 40 minutes per day. In other words, a mile or two of walking. In exchange, their risk of death goes down by 10 percent.\n\nWalking a bit farther — say, 2 to 3 miles at 3 mph — gets you an additional death reduction of about 30 percent. But walking more than that, or more than an hour a day at this speed, is no better.\n\nOther studies of walking find similar magnitudes. A large meta-analysis found that, on average, walking 1 to 3 miles at about a 20-minute-mile pace results in a reduction in death risk of about 10 percent.\n\nMany of these studies do not separate out speed and duration, but to the extent they do, it seems like walking faster may be better than walking slower. Here is one study that shows large mortality reductions for fast walking even for short periods, and here is another showing that very slow walking has fewer benefits than faster walking.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem obvious that the harder you exercise, the better. If walking faster is more energy-intensive than walking slower, and running is more energy-intensive than walking, it seems like the health benefits of running would be even greater. In some sense, you’d hope so, since most of us find running more difficult than walking.\n\nBroadly, over some range, this seems to be right. The chart below shows results for two studies of runners that, again, relate METs to hazard rates of death. Running — even slowly, like 5 mph — is far more energy-intensive than walking. An energy expenditure of 1.19 METs per day (the lowest-energy-expenditure group in the second study here) means about 20 minutes of running a 12-minute mile, three times a week.\n\nSlow running like this appears to have a much larger impact on mortality than walking. A hazard rate of 0.48 — compared with a sedentary group — suggests a much larger reduction in the risk of death than a hazard rate of 0.90. What is a bit surprising about this chart is that running faster or farther doesn’t seem to reduce death rates any more than running slowly and, in fact, in both cases is slightly worse.\n\nIn one of these studies it looks like running very intensely (faster than an eight-minute mile, more than four hours a week) increases your risk of death relative to not running at all. But a closer look at the data suggests that this is probably just a statistical artifact: This intense running group contains only 36 people and two deaths, versus hundreds of people in the more casual running groups.\n\nEven if we dismiss the possibility that running harder is worse, it is probably useful to note that running harder or farther doesn’t seem to be better. I have occasionally felt guilty about my thrice-weekly 25-minute runs, especially in comparison to my brother, who runs a 2:45 marathon and once attempted the Leadville Trail 100. It is comforting to know that I can still outlive him.\n\nOne general problem with all of this research is that none of these studies is randomized. People who exercise are different from those who do not, and those who exercise more are different from those who exercise less. This should, as usual, give us some pause in trumpeting the virtues of exercise. However, I’d argue that the comparisons the studies make among runners are still valid.\n\nTo be more concrete: In most of these studies, the more intense runners are healthier (for example: less likely to smoke and thinner) than the less-intense runners. We may tend to attribute the health of this group to their running habits. The fact that even with this bias we see no large benefit — indeed, seemingly no benefit at all — to running more rather than running less reinforces the value of moderate running.\n\nIf we take this research at face value, we learn a few things. First, some exercise reduces your risk of death. Second, the optimal walking/jogging exercise is light to moderate jogging. The optimal speed is between 5 and 7 mph, and if you do 25 minutes about three times a week, you’re all set. Nothing in the data suggests that running more — farther, or faster — will do more to lower your risk of death.']",How fast should you run to live longer? This story provides clear answer based on the best available evidence.,"The story looks at several studies to address how much time an individual needs to devote to cardiovascular exercise each week in order to significantly reduce their risk of death in a given year. The story also attempts to address whether it is better walk, jog, or run in order to achieve the desired reduction in risk. Ultimately, the story makes three statements: some exercise reduces the risk of death (in a given year); light to moderate jogging (between 5 and 7 miles per hour) is the optimal pace; and if you do 25 minutes of jogging at this pace, three times per week, “you’re all set.” Although the language used in places is not as precise as we’d like (based on the available evidence, we can’t really say whether exercise at a given intensity “reduces” death risk as the story states, merely that it is “associated with” lower risk), the coverage overall is thorough and balanced. The story is up front with readers about the limitations of the studies and provides a clear explanation of them. And it’s hard to argue with the advice that some moderate exercise is worthwhile. The story would have been better if it had addressed the fact that running (even recreationally) poses some health risks — and is not an option for many readers.

REUTERS/Ali Jarekji\n\nThe test, which uses conventional magnetic resonance imaging or MRI machines, detected 94 percent of individuals with a high-functioning form of autism, they reported on Thursday.\n\n“These results are the best yet in the search for a biological basis in terms of being able to distinguish those with and without the disease,” said Nicholas Lange of Harvard Medical School, who directs the Neurostatistics Laboratory at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts.\n\nHe said the findings, published in the journal Autism Research, were very preliminary, but if confirmed in several more and larger studies, they might replace current subjective tests now used to diagnose the disorder.\n\nAnd, he said, they might also lead to better management and treatment of people with autism, a complex and mysterious brain disorder usually first diagnosed in early childhood.\n\nAutism is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and understanding other people’s emotions and behavior.\n\nFor the study, researchers at McLean and a team led by Dr. Janet Lainhart the University of Utah used an MRI that was tuned to pick up microscopic features of the brain’s wiring — a technique known as diffusion tensor imaging.\n\n“You don’t need any fancy equipment. This is performed around the world,” Lange said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe team did scans of this type on the brains of 30 people with autism and 30 people without.\n\nThey found that the brain circuitry is significantly different in those with autism compared to people with normal brain function, specifically in areas of the brain that are engaged in language and social and emotional functioning.\n\nBy measuring six aspects of the brain’s circuitry, the test was able to correctly pick out people who had been diagnosed with autism with 94 percent accuracy.\n\nA repeat study using two different sets of subjects showed the same high level of performance.\n\nLange said the findings should help make the process of diagnosing autism more scientific because it would rely on a test rather than a subjective assessment.\n\nAnd it may also offer an early diagnosis, which could help affected children get earlier intervention, when it is most likely to do some good.\n\n“The basis of autism in the brain is very deep. There may be very little that one can actually change about the disorder for an individual with a severe case,” Lange said.\n\n“However, it has been shown that in the early stages of development, individuals have been aided by intense one-on-one caring to help them with language, social function with their peers and also with emotional problems,” he said.\n\nAutism disorders are diagnosed in one in 110 children in the United States and affect four times as many boys as girls.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">Reuters blew this very small study with obvious design limitations far out of proportion, trumpeting it as “closing in on an accurate test for autism, a finding that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.” Meantime, the lead researcher, <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3402"" target=""_blank"">in a CNN story</a>, said it’s not ready for prime time.<br/>

The study led by Professor Roy Taylor, from Newcastle University, and Professor Mike lean from Glasgow University, found that 45.6% of those who were put on a low calorie diet for three to five months and were able to stop their Type 2 diabetes medications. Importantly, long-term support by routine General Practice staff was given to help the paticipants maintain their weight loss. The trial, called DiRECT (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial) and funded by Diabetes UK, recruited 298 people between the Newcastle and Glasgow University and builds on Professor Taylor’s earlier pilot work. Professor Taylor, lead researcher of the DiRECT trial, said: “These findings are very exciting. They could revolutionise the way Type 2 diabetes is treated. “The study builds on the work into the underlying cause of the condition, so that we can target management effectively. “Substantial weight loss results in reduced fat inside the liver and pancreas, allowing these organs to return to normal function. “What we’re seeing from DiRECT is that losing weight isn’t just linked to better management of Type 2 diabetes: significant weight loss could actually result in lasting remission.""\n\nProfessor Roy Taylor\n\nThese findings are very exciting. They could revolutionise the way Type 2 diabetes is treated Professor Roy Taylor\n\nRemission achieved Remission was defined as having blood glucose levels (HbA1c) of less than 6.5% (48mmol/mol) at 12 months, with at least two months without any Type 2 diabetes medications. Of the 298 people recruited to take part in DiRECT, half received standard diabetes care from their GP, whilst the other half received a structured weight management programme within primary care. The programme included a low calorie, nutrient-complete diet for three to five months, food reintroduction and long-term support to maintain weight loss. Type 2 diabetes remission was found to be closely related to weight loss. Over half (57%) of those who lost 10 to 15kg achieved remission, along with a third (34%) of those who lost five to 10kg. Only 4% of the control group achieved remission. The findings have been presented at the International Diabetes Federation Congress in Abu Dhabi today by the lead researchers, Professor Taylor and Professor Mike Lean. Professor Lean said: “Putting Type 2 diabetes into remission as early as possible after diagnosis could have extraordinary benefits, both for the individual and the NHS. DiRECT is telling us it could be possible for as many as half of patients to achieve this in routine primary care, and without drugs. “We’ve found that people were really interested in this approach – almost a third of those who were asked to take part in the study agreed. This is much higher than usual acceptance rates for diabetes clinical trials.""\n\nTwo-year trial DiRECT is a two-year trial which aims to find an effective and accessible way to put Type 2 diabetes into remission for the long-term. The trial is delivered through GP practices across Tyneside and Scotland to find out if the benefits of a structured weight management programme can be felt in a real-life primary care setting. DiRECT also aims to understand why significant weight loss results in remission, to understand which groups might benefit in the future. Type 2 diabetes is a life-changing condition that progresses over time, which can have devastating consequences. Finding ways to put it into lasting remission could significantly reduce the cost of delivering diabetes care and treating serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease or stroke. Remission could transform the lives of millions of people living with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes. Isobel Murray, 65, from North Ayrshire, took part in DiRECT from 2014 to 2016. She was on the low calorie diet programme for 17 weeks and put her Type 2 diabetes into remission after the first four months. Over the two year trial, Isobel lost more than three and a half stone and no longer needs to take any diabetes medication. Isobel said: “It has transformed my life, I had Type 2 diabetes for two to three years before the study. “I was on various medications which were constantly increasing and I was becoming more and more ill every day. When the opportunity came to go on the DiRECT study, I had absolutely no hesitation. “When the doctors told me that my pancreas was working again, it felt fantastic, absolutely amazing. “I don’t think of myself as a diabetic anymore, I get all my diabetes checks done, but I don’t feel like a diabetic. I am one of the lucky ones to have gone into remission.” Diabetes UK has committed more than £2.8 million to the DiRECT study. Recently, £300,000 has been committed so participants who wish to continue can be followed for up to three years and the full cost-effectiveness of this programme can be evaluated. The funding will provide further understanding around the longer term benefits, to see if a treatment of this kind could be offered to people with Type 2 diabetes in the future. Helping millions Dr Elizabeth Robertson, Director of Research at Diabetes UK, said: “These first year findings of DiRECT demonstrate the potential to transform the lives of millions of people. “We’re very encouraged by these initial results, and the building robust evidence that remission could be achievable for some people. “The trial is ongoing, so that we can understand the long-term effects of an approach like this. It’s very important that anyone living with Type 2 diabetes considering losing weight in this way seeks support and advice from a healthcare professional.” Whether putting Type 2 diabetes into remission can protect against diabetes-related complications later in life is not yet known, which is why it is important that those who achieve remission continue to receive health checks. More research is also needed to find out who could benefit most from treatments like this in the future, taking into account factors like ethnicity and duration of Type 2 diabetes.

The release notes that 45.6 percent of patients who took part in the weight loss program achieved remission of their type 2 diabetes, and that remission was closely correlated with weight loss; the more weight study participants lost, the more likely they were to achieve remission.
While the release does a good job of describing the study, it does not mention previous studies related to weight loss and type 2 diabetes. That’s a significant oversight that makes it difficult for readers to place the new findings in context. It’s worth noting that HealthNewsReview.org reviewed a previous release from the same university on earlier findings from the same research group. While the more recent release does a better job of addressing benefits and the quality of the evidence, some problems — such as the failure to address novelty and place the work in context — were not addressed.  Further, there is no mention in the release about the conflicts of interest on the part of several authors in their relationships with Counterweight and Cambridge Weight Plans.
And like the TIME story on the Newcastle University research, the release doesn’t inform readers about cost and harms of the diet.

More than 1.8 million smokers attempted to quit smoking because of the nine-week-long 2014 Tips From Former Smokers ( Tips ) campaign. An estimated 104,000 Americans quit smoking for good as a result of the 2014 campaign. The survey results are published in the March 24 release of the journal Preventing Chronic Disease.\n\nUnlike the 2012 campaign, which aired for 12 consecutive weeks, the 2014 campaign aired in two phases, from February 3 to April 6 and from July 7 to September 7. Phase 1 of the 2014 campaign ran ads primarily from the 2012 and 2013 campaigns; Phase 2 contained new ads. Those new ads featured people and their struggles with smoking-related health issues, including cancer, gum disease, premature birth, and stroke caused by smoking combined with HIV. About 80 percent of U.S. adult cigarette smokers who were surveyed reported seeing at least one television ad from Phase 2 of the 2014 campaign.\n\n“CDC’s Tips campaign has helped at least 400,000 smokers quit smoking for good since 2012,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. “Tips is also extremely cost-effective and a best buy, saving both lives and money. With a year-round campaign we could save even more lives and money.”\n\nTips, the first federally funded anti-smoking paid media campaign, features former smokers talking about their smoking-related illnesses. Smoking-related diseases cost the United States more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct health care costs and more than $156 billion in lost productivity.\n\n“The Tips campaign is an important counter measure to the $1 million that the tobacco industry spends each hour on cigarette advertising and promotion,” said Corinne Graffunder, Dr.P.H., director of CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health. “The money spent in one year on Tips is less than the amount the tobacco industry spends on advertising and promotion in just 3 days.”\n\nThe most recent Surgeon General’s Report, The Health Consequences of Smoking—50 Years of Progress, called for airing effective messages such as the Tips ads with high frequency and exposure for 12 months a year for a decade or more. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States, killing about 480,000 Americans each year.\n\nFor every American who dies from a smoking-related disease, about 30 more suffer at least one serious illness from smoking. And while the percentage of American adults who smoke is at the lowest level since the CDC began tracking such data, there are still an estimated 40 million adult smokers in the U.S. Surveys show about 70 percent of all smokers want to quit, and research shows quitting completely at any age has significant health benefits.\n\nTips ads encourage smokers to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or to visit www.cdc.gov/tips to view the personal stories from the campaign. The website includes detailed assistance developed by the National Cancer Institute to support smokers trying to quit. For more information on the Tips campaign, including profiles of the former smokers, other campaign resources, and links to the ads, visit www.cdc.gov/tips.\n\n###\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESexternal icon']","This news release, exploring the impact of a federally funded anti-smoking ad campaign, is strong in some areas, weaker in others.","CDC Tips ad campaign features advice from former smokers
This news release focuses on a recent study that evaluates the effectiveness of a 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) educational advertising campaign called “Tips From Former Smokers” (Tips) that aimed to encourage and help cigarette smokers quit smoking. The release highlights the health risks associated with smoking and the estimated effectiveness of the ad campaign. The release also argues that the Tips campaign was a cost-effective means of helping people quit smoking. It provides some good background data on the health-related costs of smoking as well as estimates on how many people were reached through the ad campaign.

But diagnosing allergies can be tricky, and kids can outgrow them, too.\n\nNow, a new study sheds light on the effectiveness of a test called a food challenge to determine whether a person can tolerate a food they once reacted to.\n\nJula Cieciuch, a fifth-grader who lives in Telluride, Colo., recently took a food challenge to find out if she was still allergic to eggs.\n\nWhen she passed, she was ecstatic. After years of avoiding all foods with eggs, she was a bit shocked. ""For so long, it was: You can\'t eat this. You can\'t eat this,"" Jula says. "" I was very emotional!""\n\nShe\'s also outgrown allergies to walnuts and almonds. ""It\'s a huge relief ... it has really opened up her diet — a lot,"" her mom, Kendall Cieciuch, told us. Once you can eat eggs, you can eat cakes and breads and frittatas, and lots of other baked goods.\n\nJula is still allergic to some foods, including milk and cashews, so she still needs to be careful. But Kendall says every time she\'s crossed a food off her allergy list, ""it makes life a little easier.""\n\nJula Cieciuch\'s story is not uncommon. About 70 to 80 percent of children with an egg allergy will outgrow it. And about 20 percent of kids outgrow peanut allergies.\n\nIn Jula\'s case, her allergists at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., repeated the standard allergy blood tests last summer. That\'s when they realized she may have outgrown her egg allergy.\n\n\n\nThe blood test measures the levels of a certain type of antibody, immunoglobulin E (IgE). The higher the level, the more likely a person is to have an allergic reaction. Jula\'s blood revealed a drop in antibody count.\n\n\n\nBut the only way to confirm that it was safe for Jula to eat egg was to take the food challenge test. Basically, the test entails eating small quantities of the foods you\'ve been allergic to. The testing is done under medical supervision.\n\n""What they do is give you a really small dose, like a crumb, basically,"" explains Jula. Then after 20 minutes or so, if you don\'t have any reaction, ""you can take a dose that\'s a little bigger."" If you can eat an entire egg, you pass.\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology illuminates just how many people come to find out they can eat foods they\'ve long avoided.\n\n\n\nResearchers studied the results of about 6,300 food challenges. The tests were done in adults and children whom doctors suspected had become tolerant to foods they\'d once reacted to.\n\n\n\n""We found that 14 percent of the patients challenged had mild or moderate allergic reactions,"" explains study author Carla Davis, an allergist and director of the Food Allergy Program at Texas Children\'s Hospital. ""If the symptoms were treated with just Benadryl or another antihistamine, they were considered mild or moderate. She says 2 percent of the reactions were more serious, requiring treatment with epinephrine.\n\nBut the vast majority of patients, 86 percent, did not have an allergic reaction. In other words, they tolerated the food just fine. She says the results aren\'t that surprising, since allergists had classified these patients as low-risk for reacting to the foods they were being tested for.\n\n\n\n""I think [the results] are very encouraging,"" Bruce Lanser, a pediatric allergist who directs the Pediatric Food Allergy Program at National Jewish Health in Denver, told us. He was not involved in the study, but he says the findings mirror what he sees in his clinical practice. ""We know a certain percentage will outgrow [their] allergies,"" Lanser says. ""And the last thing I want to miss is the opportunity to get a food into a kid\'s diet.""\n\nHe says many of the patients in the study may have outgrown their allergy, just like Jula did. ""But it\'s also possible [some of them] never truly had a food allergy."" As we\'ve reported, people sometimes misinterpret the symptoms of a condition such as lactose intolerance for a food allergy.\n\nLanser says it can be tricky to diagnose food allergies. That\'s because the two main tests doctors use — the blood test and the skin prick test — only reveal part of the story. ""Both tests only measure sensitization,"" he explains. ""All they can tell us is how likely you are to react when you eat the food.""\n\n\n\nAnd that\'s where the oral food challenge comes in. It\'s become the gold standard test to rule out an allergy.\n\n\n\nSo, if you or your child tested positive for a food allergy years ago, you may want to consider seeing an allergist again.']","The story would have scored stronger if it had better described what kind of research this was, and what made it novel.","This story reports the results of a study of 6,300 oral food challenges, or medically supervised allergy tests, to determine whether patients have outgrown their food allergies.
The story did a good job discussing how oral food challenges work, and included an expert source not directly connected to the research who provided important context. It discussed the risks of oral food challenges, and why they are best done in a carefully monitored setting. The story would have scored stronger if it had better described what kind of research this was, and what made it novel. We also think a discussion of how much oral challenge tests typically cost–with and without insurance–would be useful information for parents.
One minor quibble: The headline made it sound like this was a new test–it’s not. What’s new is the research findings and what they illuminate for doctors.

Michael Lauer, director of the cardiovascular-sciences division at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, wrote in a commentary accompanying the CCTA study, ""We cannot simply assume that just because a screening test predicts clinical outcomes, interventions necessarily will prevent them.""\n\nThe study of CCTA screening comes as medical experts are re-evaluating the frequency and usefulness of other types of health screening, including mammographies for women and PSA testing for prostate cancer in men.\n\nThe CCTA test isn\'t currently a common screening test for heart disease, and American Heart Association guidelines recommend against such use of it. Still, Dr. Lauer said such use is likely to grow. The test costs from $600 to $1,000 per patient, researchers say.\n\nDr. Lauer said the heart, lung and blood institute is funding separate studies of CCTA involving patients with chest pain and other symptoms of heart disease to better define how to use the test.\n\nFor now, most doctors assess risk for coronary heart disease using blood tests to measure cholesterol and other fats in the blood, and then in some cases prescribe medication to lower cholesterol. Imaging tests often are reserved for patients with chest pain or other heart-disease signs.\n\nIn a CCTA test, patients are injected with dye and then undergo a scan, which creates three-dimensional images of the heart and blood vessels. The images show plaque and other deposits that often build up inside blood vessels and can lead to heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems.\n\nThe test differs from a coronary angiogram or a cardiac catheterization, in which a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or leg and then guided into the heart to look for blockages or narrowing of blood vessels.\n\nIn contrast, the CCTA scan isn\'t invasive, and for that reason some medical experts say it has potential to be widely used for screening healthy patients for heart disease. Some anecdotal evidence suggests such screening is happening and becoming more common.\n\nThe researchers looked at patients who weren\'t considered high risk but did exhibit some risk factors for heart disease. Almost all adults over age 50 likely have some plaque in their arteries, he said.\n\nThe study involved 2,000 patients in South Korea with an average age of 50 taking part in a health-screening program. The study compared 1,000 individuals who underwent a CCTA exam with 1,000 who didn\'t undergo the test.\n\nIt found 215 patients who underwent the exam had a positive result, meaning they were found to have plaque in their blood vessels. These patients were 10 times as likely to have been sent for an exercise stress test, a nuclear medicine scan or a cardiac catheterization as patients who didn\'t have the CCTA test.\n\nThe patients also were three times as likely to be taking a statin medication, and four times as likely to be on aspirin therapy, both designed to lower risk of heart attack.\n\nAfter 18 months, the study showed, one person in the CCTA group developed a heart problem known as unstable angina and one person in the non-testing group had a fatal heart attack.\n\n""Our findings suggest that low-risk patients without symptoms don\'t benefit in the short term from knowing whether or not plaque has been detected using CT angiography,"" Dr. McEvoy said. ""However, their physicians may be inclined to be more aggressive with prescriptions or follow-up tests.""\n\nPatients would have to be followed for a longer period to look at whether there\'s a true difference in heart events and heart-related deaths between the two groups, Dr. McEvoy said.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Corbett Dooren at jennifer.corbett-dooren@dowjones.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story addressed most of our criteria and was a technically competent story.  But it lacked the clarity on significance and the punch that a competing </span>","This story reported on a study which found that using coronary CT angiography to screen for heart disease did not result in improved outcomes for patients during the 18 months in which they were studied.

Pereira wrote about blood pressure reductions in a patient getting deep brain stimulation in the January 2010 issue of the Journal of Clinical Neuroscience.\n\n“I think that’s important because it paves the way for potentially studying patients without chronic pain and offering the treatment sometime in the future to reduce blood pressure,” he says.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This 1,000-word WebMD story was more detailed than its 440-word <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3566"" target=""_blank"">HealthDay counterpart</a> on the same topic, but the extra length didn’t seem to help the story satisfy any more of our criteria. </span>","In describing why researchers think deep brain stimulation (DBS) might one day be a treatment option for patients with difficult-to-treat high blood pressure, the story didn’t adequately caution that the excitement is based on a case report from a single patient.

The observational study referenced in this news release suggests that people who have bariatric surgery may have a lower rate of death than those who try to lose weight using nonsurgical alternatives.
Although the study is larger than many similar ones, it suffers from some of the same limitations; mainly difficulties matching the two study groups in such a way that the differences in their outcomes can be attributed to something other than chance.
This news release does touch on these limitations but would have served readers better if it had included more on the costs and risks involved in bariatric surgery, as well as some discussion of nonsurgical alternatives.

According to a study published in the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the official medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists® (ASA®), patients who received a novel high frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy experienced significantly greater, long-term relief for both chronic back and leg pain, when compared to a traditional low frequency form of SCS therapy.“This is the first long-term study to compare the safety and effectiveness of high frequency and traditional SCS therapy for back and leg pain,” said Leonardo Kapural, M.D., lead study author and professor of anesthesiology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and clinical director at Carolinas Pain Institute at Brookstown in Winston-Salem, N.C. “Chronic back and leg pain have long been considered difficult to treat and current pain relief options such as opioids have limited effectiveness and commonly known side effects. Given the prevalence of chronic pain, high frequency SCS is an exciting advance for our patients.”\n\n\n\nSCS is an increasingly common therapy that delivers electric pulses to the spinal cord, through a small device implanted under the skin, for difficult to treat chronic pain in the trunk and limbs. SCS is reversible and is an important option for chronic pain sufferers who otherwise would rely on opioids or back surgery for relief. The new treatment, called HF10™ therapy, uses proprietary high frequency pulses of 10,000 Hz, compared to traditional SCS which uses frequencies of 40 to 60 Hz. HF10 therapy also provides pain relief without paresthesia – a stimulation-induced sensation commonly perceived as tingling or buzzing, which masks a patient’s perception of pain – typical of traditional SCS. These sensations are often distracting or uncomfortable to patients and limit the utility and acceptance of traditional devices. Identifying a new intervention that does not rely on paresthesia to mask pain is novel to SCS and has the potential to improve pain relief and quality of life for these complex patients. In the study, researchers examined 171 patients with chronic back or leg pain who were implanted at 10 comprehensive pain treatment centers. Of these, 90 patients received HF10 therapy, while 81 patients had traditional SCS.\n\n\n\nAt three months, 85 percent of back pain and 83 percent of leg pain patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain or greater. Conversely, only 44 percent of back pain and 56 percent of leg pain patients in the traditional SCS group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain. None of the patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced paresthesia. HF10 therapy remained more effective than traditional SCS over the 12 month study period. More patients in the HF10 therapy group reported being “very satisfied” with their pain relief (55 percent versus 32 percent). More than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with lower back pain being the most frequent condition affecting 23 to 26 percent of the population.\n\n\n\nTHE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS\n\n\n\nFounded in 1905, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is an educational, research and scientific society with more than 52,000 members organized to raise and maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology. ASA is committed to ensuring that physician anesthesiologists evaluate and supervise the medical care of patients before, during, and after surgery to provide the highest quality and safest care that every patient deserves.\n\n\n\nFor more information on the field of anesthesiology, visit the American Society of Anesthesiologists online at asahq.org.

There’s also a suggestion that patients only have 2 other options besides this device–surgery or narcotics–which is misleading.,"The release reports on a study that tested a new type of implanted device for the treatment of chronic back and leg pain. It uses high-frequency electrical pulses, delivered directly to the spinal cord via implanted leads. The study compared this high-frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to a more traditional approach that uses lower-frequency pulses. The main advantage of the new approach, according to the release, is that patients don’t feel an annoying tingling or buzzing sensation that’s associated with the traditional approach.
The release faithfully reports the outlines of the study in broad strokes and provides some of the outcomes in user-friendly terms. But there a lot of missing context that any reporter relying on the release should have been given. Notably, this was a company funded study run by investigators with close ties to the manufacturer of the device. The surgery required to implant the device can cause harms that weren’t mentioned. Finally, it’s not clear if this device is approved for use and if so, how much would it cost to have it implanted and would insurance cover that cost?

Bruce Ames and Mark K. Shigenaga at Children\'s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), was shown in clinical trials to improve metabolism in overweight/obese (OW/OB) otherwise healthy adults in ways that are consistent with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Consumption of the bar for two months also reduced chronic inflammation, and initiated a reduction in weight and waist circumference. Decreased inflammation and improved weight and weight distribution can lower the risk of many chronic diseases.\n\nThese effects occurred without requiring that participants make any change in their current diet or other lifestyle practices other than to eat two CHORI-bars each day for two months. The CHORI-bar is not just another nutrition bar. It is a serious intervention to improve health. Its composition is therefore complex, and required a number of years and a series of clinical trials to develop.\n\nThe publication describing this work appeared online today (April 22, 2015)1 at The FASEB Journal. The bar was developed over the past 10 years by a team of scientists led by Drs. Bruce N. Ames and Joyce C. McCann at CHORI (2,3), in collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nMost people do not eat an optimally nutritious diet - particularly the obese. This results in unhealthy metabolism, which not only diminishes vigor, but increases future risk of many diseases. While poor diets contain much that is not healthy (e.g., too much salt, sugar), they also are missing or deficient in a number of important components (e.g., vitamins/minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber) necessary for healthy metabolism. The CHORI-bar is intended to fill these gaps with components present in the bar in normal dietary amounts.\n\nConsiderable evidence in the scientific literature, including Drs. Ames and McCann\'s work on vitamins and minerals, supports the idea that simply supplying missing or deficient dietary ingredients will improve metabolism (4-7). Development of the CHORI-bar has also been guided by Dr. Mark Shigenaga\'s insights into the importance of a healthy gut supported by optimal nutrition for disease prevention.\n\nBecause of the strong flavors associated with some vitamins and minerals, CHORI partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture to produce a tasty bar. Formulation development was guided by over 15 small clinical trials to ensure that beneficial properties of the bar were retained. Most early trials were two weeks in length and involved primarily lean individuals, most of whom benefited by increased HDL cholesterol. Results presented in this publication are compiled from 3 two-month clinical trials that also included a significant number of overweight/obese individuals. These trials were conducted over a 4-year period using very similar bar formulations. These trials employed a simple, economical design in which participants acted as their own controls (i.e., change in metabolic markers was measured before and after eating the bar).\n\nHealthy metabolism is like a complex, smooth-running machine. Unhealthy metabolism is like an old machine with many rusted out joints. There is no magic bullet ingredient in nutrition - ""oiling"" one joint is not going to allow the rusted out machine to run. The CHORI-team thinks the broad scale improvements observed with the CHORI-bar may be the result of ""oiling"" multiple joints by the complex nutrient mixture. They are currently conducting experiments to better understand which ingredients in the bar are most important in the complex mixture for the observed effects.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of obesity is taking a huge toll on public health. Conventional approaches that encourage weight loss by improving dietary habits, reducing caloric intake and modifying activity can be successful, but prove difficult for many to initiate and sustain. The CHORI-bar is intended as a non-traditional means to positively impact the obesity epidemic by initiating a healthier metabolism without requiring sudden drastic behavioral changes. It may therefore assist in weight loss programs by beginning a process of favorable metabolic change. Improved metabolism resulting from eating the bar is also associated with a number of reports of feeling better (though this observation has not yet been formally tested), which the CHORI team predicts will help people transition to improved lifestyle habits.\n\nThe power of nutrient-rich, properly formulated food-based supplements, such as the CHORI-bar, to move dysregulated metabolism in a healthy direction may help reverse obesity-associated conditions, and thereby reduce the risk of future chronic diseases. The full potential of food-based supplements to do the work of some drugs without their negative side effects is just beginning to be seriously investigated.\n\n###\n\nAbout UCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospital Oakland\n\nUCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospital Oakland (formerly Children\'s Hospital & Research Center Oakland) is a premier, not-for-profit medical center for children in Northern California, and is the only hospital in the East Bay 100% devoted to pediatrics.

Unfortunately, this news release isn’t up to the task. Though it cites “broad scale health improvements” in the headline, the release offers no data that would substantiate a beneficial effect to consumers of the “CHORI bar.” It provides only vague, advertising-like claims such as this one: “The full potential of food-based supplements to do the work of some drugs without their negative side effects is just beginning to be seriously investigated.”

Almost immediately, he began producing the missing clotting factor. Several weeks later, after he dropped a heavy box on his shin, he watched a bruise develop and shrink within hours. “Are you kidding me?” he thought. “Life's easy if this is what happens.”\n\nKonduros, 53, who runs a bakery and cafe in southeastern Ontario, is one of 10 men in an early-stage trial sponsored by Spark Therapeutics. (The disorder is much more common in men than women.) On Wednesday, researchers reported that a single intravenous infusion of Spark's novel gene therapy enabled patients to safely produce sufficient clotting factor to prevent dangerous bleeding episodes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe treatment also “nearly universally eliminated” the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. And its effects lasted; after a year and a half, the longest patient follow-up, the therapy was continuing to work.\n\nThe results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent “another example of the gene-therapy renaissance,” Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. He said the data suggests that the treatment ultimately might provide an “ideal cure” for hemophilia B.\n\nStill, he noted, the study has some limitations. The follow-up period was relatively short, from 28 to 78 weeks in the new report; longer-term studies are needed to prove safety and effectiveness over extended periods. In addition, he said, researchers need to find ways to provide the therapy to a broader group of people, including children, and to figure out how to reduce the costs involved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe researchers presented earlier findings on the gene therapy a year ago at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting, but the latest data covers a larger patient group and a longer time period.\n\nThe hemophilia gene therapy is one of several being tested for conditions including sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease. The one-time treatments seek to fight the disease by adding correct copies of a patient's defective genes. If approved, such treatments are expected to command stratospheric prices. For example, a separate Spark gene therapy for a rare type of childhood blindness, which is on track for Food and Drug Administration clearance soon, could cost $1 million per patient for infusions in both eyes, according to some Wall Street analysts.\n\nStill, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings. Porteus noted in his editorial that the hemophilia therapy resulted in savings of about $200,000 a year per patient because of the elimination of clotting-factor infusions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther experts also were impressed by the results. The hemophilia study “is small but very promising, and it gives me the sense that gene therapy for hemophilia B is going to be at our disposal in no time, maybe a few years from now,” said Aric Parnes, who is associate director of the Boston Hemophilia Center at the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and wasn't involved in the study. “One of the key things is, how long will the treatment last? Does it wane over time? So far, with a full year, it doesn’t look like that is happening.”\n\nLindsey George, the lead investigator and a hematologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that nine of the 10 men in the trial didn't experience any bleeding episodes after the gene therapy treatment. The one patient who needed clotting factor because of bleeding used 91 percent less than before, she said.\n\n“People were planning their lives around hemophilia, and now they are doing activities that they weren't before,” George said. “One man who came in a wheelchair is now out of a wheelchair and is coaching Little League.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPeople with hemophilia B inherit a gene mutation on the X chromosome that interferes with their ability to produce normal levels of blood-clotting factor IX. (Because women have two copies of the X chromosomes, the other one can compensate, so they may carry the disease but not suffer from it.) Bleeding episodes — which can result from injury or occur spontaneously — can cause extensive damage and be life threatening.\n\nThe therapy developed by Spark, a biotech company spun off from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2013, involves a bioengineered gene designed to prompt the body to produce increased levels of a different clotting factor. The gene is transported to the liver, where clotting factor is made, by a harmless virus called an adeno-associated viral vector. For the current trial, which is being funded by Spark and Pfizer, researchers used a clotting factor that is 8 to 10 times as strong as the normal version. The stronger factor is called Factor IX-Padua, because it was discovered in 2009 in an Italian family.\n\nPatients produced clotting-factor levels that were enough to allow blood to clot but not to spur an undesirable immune-system response, the researchers said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD""]",Whether this particular treatment revolutionizes the landscape for hemophilia B sufferers will remain an open question for some years–and the story should have emphasized that more.,"iStock / Getty Images Plus
A small, early-stage study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a single intravenous infusion of a novel bioengineered gene therapy treatment helped spare nine of 10 hemophilia B sufferers from repeated injections of blood-clotting factor to prevent debilitating bleeding episodes.
This well-written story shares that information carefully and clearly. However, more details about the years-long road ahead for this treatment’s development and about possible ties between the researchers and the funders would have made the piece stronger.
Complicating the care taken by the reporter, however, is a glaring headline that promises much more than this small study can deliver (“Gene therapy makes a big advance treating hemophilia B blood disorder”). Whether this particular treatment revolutionizes the landscape for hemophilia B sufferers will remain an open question for some years.

Doctors can learn immediately if devices are malfunctioning or if patients’ hearts are starting to fail.\n\n“It’s like having an office visit every day and a complete physical every week,” said Dr. Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe big leap forward came a few years ago when device companies figured out how to make transmitters that send data over a broader range, 20 or 30 feet. That meant that, with her device, Mrs. Elzo did not have to wait till her doctor could put a receiver directly on her chest. Instead, she simply went near a small box, which is attached to a phone jack near her bed. Once a week, she also measures her weight and blood pressure — key indicators of heart failure — and that information is automatically transmitted to her doctor. If there are problems, the machine alerts her doctor.\n\n“Now, every single day the device is being queried,” said her doctor, James Coman of the Heart Rhythm Institute in Tulsa. “It’s just a phenomenal tool.”\n\nThere is a downside, though: “Information overload is a very serious problem” for the doctors, said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, director of the Heart Failure Program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, who counts herself as a proponent of smart devices. More information, she warned, is not always beneficial.\n\nThe devices transmit useful data along with data whose significance is not clear, like variations in heart rate. Large swings in heart rate can indicate risk, but it is not clear what to do about them.\n\nEven more confusing are changes in thoracic impedance, a measurement of resistance to electric current through the lung. Impedance changes can predict future heart crises, but more often have no clinical explanation. Yet when doctors get data on impedance changes, they often feel uneasy and call patients to see how they are, making patients uneasy in turn, Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Stevenson likened such information to the game of “Jeopardy!” — doctors are given answers in search of a question. It’s a challenge even for the nation’s 1,000 heart failure specialists. But it can be even harder for primary care doctors, who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition.\n\nDr. Richard Page, president of the Heart Rhythm Society, said doctors wonder if they can be held liable if they do not look at all the data. Still, he said, the new technology “is potentially transformative.”\n\nFor researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem: how to analyze the data. A large clinical trial of a cardiac device used to involve 1,000, maybe 2,000 patients. Now, Boston Scientific, a maker of one of the smart heart devices, is following 400,000 patients.\n\n“No one has ever done research like this before,” said Dr. Saxon, who leads an independent team of academic scientists overseeing Boston Scientific research. The company has no editorial control over the papers the scientists write, Dr. Saxon said.\n\nBoston Scientific gets data from patients’ defibrillators. It also gets information on deaths from Medicare.\n\nThe data are stripped of patient identifiers and analyzed, a task requiring the company to become more like a Google or a Microsoft, handling enormous amounts of information. There are, for example, more than four million recordings of weights and blood pressures and over 60,000 instances when the defibrillators went off, shocking a patient’s heart.\n\nSo far, Dr. Saxon’s group has reported on the first 90,000 patients. Half of them had not been enrolled for remote monitoring and served as a control group.\n\nPhoto\n\nPatients whose doctors looked at the data survived 5 to 15 percent longer than patients in earlier clinical trials of the devices, Dr. Saxon reported. And, in a paper under review, the group reports that their three-year survival was significantly greater than that of patients in the study whose doctors did not see the data.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther researchers will be analyzing economic data. The devices can cost as much as $30,000. Do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits?\n\nA study using a similar device, made by Medtronic, suggests that is the case. The Medtronic study, directed by Dr. George Crossley, president of St Thomas Heart at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, involved 2,000 patients randomly assigned to receive a defibrillator that transmitted data or a device that did not transmit. Those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor’s offices every few months, the standard of care.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One solution, being tested by St. Jude Medical, a medical device company in St. Paul, is to let patients deal with important data.\n\nThe idea, said Dr. Neal Eigler, a senior vice president at St. Jude, is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their heart’s functioning, just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings.\n\nPatients hold a small device over their chest twice a day, and if they experience symptoms like shortness of breath. It transmits readings of blood pressure in the left atrium — the upper left chamber of the heart. If pressure in that chamber gets too high, the lungs can fill with fluid.\n\nDoctors preprogram the hand-held device to provide instructions to patients in response to their left atrial pressure measurements, telling them, for example, to take a different dose of a medication, restrict fluid intake, increase their activity level or call the clinic.\n\nIf successful, the smart device could have a big effect. One million patients a year are hospitalized for heart failure. Ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Stevenson, who has no connection with St. Jude, is intrigued. Patients can see what is happening to their own bodies and act accordingly. They have to strictly limit salt in their diet, for example, and seeing their left atrial pressure might be motivating.\n\n“A patient might say, ‘Maybe my pressure is higher because that pizza I had for dinner last night had a lot of salt,’ ” Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nAs a more positive incentive, the device can also instruct patients to decrease their medications if they are doing well.\n\nSt. Jude recently completed a small study of 40 patients and is starting a large clinical trial. In the pilot study, the device reduced the frequency of high atrial pressure readings by two-thirds and the number of hospitalizations by 80 percent over five months.\n\nMeanwhile, patients whose doctors can deal with the data stream from smart devices say they are getting peace of mind.\n\nThey include people like Danielle Denlein, who, to her total shock, developed a serious heart problem.On October 20, 2008, at 1:50 p.m., Ms. Denlein was driving to a drug store to buy formula for her 5-day-old baby girl. Suddenly, she felt a pain in her chest. She thought it was heartburn. Then it began radiating down her arm.\n\n“I just knew — I don’t know how I knew, but I knew — I was having a heart attack,” she said.\n\nAlthough she was only 35, her main coronary artery had ripped open, a rare complication associated with pregnancy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Denlein now relies on her smart defibrillator to save her from her injured heart, and to alert her doctor, Dr. Saxon, to problems if they occur.\n\n“It’s life changing,” Ms. Denlein said. “It gives me such a feeling of comfort.”\n\nMrs. Elzo feels the same way.\n\nHad her device not alerted her doctor that it needed to be replaced, she said, “I shudder to think what would have happened.”""]","While the use of new technology to provide better solutions to common problems is a source of hope, this story focused nearly exclusively on this aspect without questioning the magnitude of the benefits vs. harms and without giving a realistic evaluation of the costs.  ","This is a classic story of the potential promise of a new technology for the health care sector. A nice anecdote sets the stage and then a number of preliminary findings are used as proxies for real evidence. It is implied that the technology will keep people healthier, happier and at less cost to our costly system. This is, unfortunately, often a fairy tale mainstay of health news journalism.

Of the study participants who expressed a preference, 62 percent said they preferred the prep-free CT procedure over the colonoscopy.\n\nOnly sixty percent of Americans age 50 and over get the American Cancer Society’s recommended screening for colon cancer: a colonoscopy every 10 years, fecal occult blood test every year, or a flexible sigmoidoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or barium enema imaging every five years. Surveys suggest that patients find the prep -- required for both colonoscopy and traditional virtual colonoscopy -- to be the worst part of screening.\n\n“A number of folks, who currently aren’t being screened because they fear the prep or aren’t willing to go through it again, may be willing to have screening if they’re told they don’t need to take laxatives and can still get a potent test,” said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colon cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nAbout 49,000 Americans die every year from colon cancer, added Brooks, and at least half of those deaths could be prevented if everyone followed the screening recommendations.\n\nVirtual colonoscopy, with or without prep, has some limitations. About one in five patients must undergo a standard colonoscopy after the imaging procedure to have suspicious looking polyps snipped off and biopsied. The CT scan also delivers a dose of radiation that -- while only one-fifth of the dose of an abdominal CT scan -- was significant enough to raise the flags of the US Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nThe government advisory group decided in 2008 not to recommend the use of virtual colonoscopy, saying that evidence wasn’t sufficient enough to prove that the test’s benefits outweighed its harms, which include a dose of radiation with every screening test.\n\n(Standard colonoscopy also has rare complications such as an adverse reaction to the sedative, perforation to the colon, and bleeding from the site where the polyp was taken.)\n\nMedicare doesn’t provide coverage for the imaging test, which Zalis said costs about one-third as much as the traditional scope screening.\n\nTraditional colonscopy also trumps the virtual test when is comes to detecting smaller polyps, less than 10 millimeters in size. The new study found that virtual colonosopy detected only 70 percent of polyps under 8 millimeters in size, compared with 88 percent detected by a scope. What’s not clear, though, is whether missing these smaller polyps will make a difference in terms of catching growths before they turn into cancer.\n\n“Studies are underway right now,” said Brooks, “to track these smaller lesions, to see what happens to them.”\n\nDeborah Kotz can be reached at dkotz@globe.com.

The difference is subtle but important. The Journal focused too narrowly on the idea that patients might be able to avoid cleansing their colons before going in to get a computer scan of their intestines.

Last week, a review of prior studies suggested that selenium probably doesn’t help prevent cancer, but might be linked to an increased diabetes risk at high doses (see Reuters Health story of May 11, 2011.)\n\n“We don’t really know where we are,” Guallar told Reuters Health. “In a sense it’s a necessary micronutrient and we need it, but we might be (in) a situation where we have enough — we might even have too much.”\n\nSelenium is found in meat, bread, and some nuts. It’s also available in supplement form, and costs about $2 for a month’s supply.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine recommends U.S. adults consume 55 micrograms of selenium per day.\n\nGuallar and his colleagues wanted to look specifically at the link between selenium and cholesterol. They recruited about 500 older adults in the UK to take one of three different doses of selenium daily — 100, 200, or 300 micrograms — or a placebo pill with no selenium.\n\nResearchers measured participants’ cholesterol levels at the beginning of the study and after six months on the selenium supplements or placebo. Their results are published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nParticipants had an average starting cholesterol of about 230 milligrams per deciliter of blood. A healthy cholesterol level is less than 200 mg/dL, according to the American Heart Association, while 200 to 239 mg/dL is considered “borderline high.”\n\nIn the groups taking 100 and 200 micrograms of selenium daily, total cholesterol dropped an average of 8.5 mg/dL and 9.7 mg/dL, respectively, compared to the group taking a placebo pill.\n\nTaking the highest dose of selenium was not linked to decreases in total cholesterol — but it was the only dose associated with an increase in HDL (“good”) cholesterol.\n\nThe authors reported no serious side effects associated with selenium during the study.\n\nWhile Guallar said the results are “good news” in showing that high selenium intake is probably not a risk for high cholesterol, he wanted to add a note of caution.\n\nThe finding “is not generalizable to other patients,” he said. “In a population like the U.S. where selenium levels are adequate, there’s no reason to take extra selenium in supplements.”\n\nThe question of the link between selenium and health outcomes, Guallar said, “is a very interesting story that’s still developing.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/atTzv0 Annals of Internal Medicine, online May 16, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""> This story about selenium’s effects on cholesterol met more of our criteria in fewer words than the competing <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3939"" target=""_blank"">HealthDay story</a>.</span>","While both stories managed to deliver the correct bottom line about selenium supplements, Reuters did a better job explaining the costs and availability of selenium supplements and reporting the data presented in the study.

Making it worse for many patients, there hasn\'t been a conclusive test to diagnose what\'s wrong with them. Without proof of a physical cause, some doctors considered IBS a psychological disorder.\n\nBut that could finally change with the introduction of two simple new blood tests for spotting the disease. Dr. Mark Pimentel of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles developed the tests.\n\n""We now have a test to say, you have a disease,"" Pimentel told CBS News. ""Having a test like this shortens the time of suffering, it shortens the time of investigation and accelerates getting the patient directly to treatment.""\n\nNew tests for common gastrointestinal disorder\n\nThe tests, which measure antibodies in the blood, were based on research suggesting that IBS may develop after infection from a bacterial toxin found in food poisoning. Researchers believe the toxin triggers the immune system to attack a person\'s intestinal tract long after the toxin is gone.\n\nIrina Obenauer was diagnosed with IBS years ago after suffering from diarrhea and bloating, but it took doctors a long time to rule out other possible diagnoses first.\n\n""There\'s always kind of a \'trend of the week\' that you had to go and get tested for and rule out, and at the end of the day you don\'t feel better,"" she said.\n\nShe got the new blood test to confirm her diagnosis, and when it came back positive, she said she felt a sense of relief knowing IBS wasn\'t all in her head.\n\n""I\'m not saying the symptoms went away,"" she said, but she ""started to feel more whole.""\n\nCBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, who is also a practicing internist and gastroenterologist, points out that the test is not perfect. While a positive test result is highly suggestive of IBS, only 44 percent of patients with IBS tested positive, meaning that many people who test negative could in fact still have the condition.']",This story has many of the same problems as the news release ,"
A new test to help determine a more definitive diagnosis for people who suffer from gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and bloating would be a very good thing.  Seeing as millions of people around the world suffer from uncomfortable and embarrassing symptoms that might be related to an irritable bowel, a better test to diagnose the condition could have far reaching implications. Unfortunately this story struck out on almost all counts — lacking detail on current ways to diagnose IBS, giving no sense of the magnitude of benefits or harms, and ultimately failing to deliver an adequate explanation of how patients would be better off if they receive a more definitive diagnosis of IBS. These shortcomings are similar to those of the news release that likely prompted the story, and which we also subjected to a systematic review.

There are no previously approved therapies for TRAPS or HIDS/MKD.\n\n“For the first time, patients with TRAPS and HIDS/MKD, two painful and life altering diseases, have access to a treatment that may help improve their quality of life,” said Badrul Chowdhury, M.D., Ph.D, director of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products in FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\nIlaris was previously approved for another periodic fever syndrome called Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) and for active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Health care professionals should review the prescribing information in the labeling for detailed information about the approved uses.\n\nApprovals for the new indications were based on clinical studies, including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data. The most common adverse reactions for these indications are injection site reactions and being more susceptible to catching colds.\n\nIlaris can cause serious side effects, including increased risk of serious infections. Ilaris can lower the immune system’s ability to fight infections. Other serious side effects include decreased ability to fight infections (immunosuppression) and allergic reactions. Patients experiencing any symptoms of an allergic reaction should call their healthcare provider, including: rash, itching and hives, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and dizziness or feeling faint.

""Hopefully, this is a good start for a more reliable test.""\n\nDr. Durado Brooks, director of colorectal cancer at the American Cancer Society, agreed. ""These findings are interesting,"" he said. ""They will be more interesting if we ever get this kind of data in a screening population.""\n\nThe study\'s lead researcher remained optimistic.\n\n""There are 150,000 new cases of colon cancer each year in the United States, treated at an estimated cost of $14 billion,"" noted Dr. David A. Ahlquist, professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\n""The dream is to eradicate colon cancer altogether and the most realistic approach to getting there is screening,"" he said. ""And screening not only in a way that would not only detect cancer, but pre-cancer. Our test takes us closer to that dream.""\n\nAhlquist was scheduled to present the findings of the study Thursday in Philadelphia at a meeting on colorectal cancer sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research.\n\nThe new technology, called the Cologuard sDNA test, works by identifying specific altered DNA in cells shed by pre-cancerous or cancerous polyps into the patient\'s stool.\n\nIf a DNA abnormality is found, a colonoscopy would still be needed to confirm the results, just as happens now after a positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) result.\n\nTo see whether the test was effective, Ahlquist\'s team tried it out on more than 1,100 frozen stool samples from patients with and without colorectal cancer.\n\nThe test was able to detect 85.3 percent of colorectal cancers and 63.8 percent of polyps bigger than 1 centimeter. Polyps this size are considered pre-cancers and most likely to progress to cancer, Ahlquist said.\n\nThe sensitivity of the test is much better than what has been seen in other stool screening tests, the ACS\' Brooks added. ""But, showing that in a small group of samples is very different from demonstrating that in a population where only a small number of individuals are going to have polyps of that size. Then we will know if this is a big step forward,"" he said.\n\nAccording to Ahlquist, Cologuard is the first noninvasive test to detect pre-cancerous polyps, he added.\n\nIn addition, the test is the only one that is able to identify cancer in all locations throughout the colon, something which other tests either can\'t or don\'t do well, Ahlquist said.\n\nOne more advantage: patients do not need to do any special preparation before taking the test, something that other tests require, he added.\n\nAhlquist noted that the test still needs to be refined. ""We learned there are still some bugs and we can make the test even better,"" he said.\n\nCologuard is not yet available for sale. Clinical trials comparing the test with colonoscopy are slated to start next year. Ahlquist hopes that the test will be approved and available within two years.\n\nAhlquist noted that the cost of the test has not yet been established. It is expected to cost more than a fecal occult blood test, but far less than a colonoscopy. A fecal occult blood test can cost as little as $23 while a colonoscopy can total $700.\n\nAnother benefit is that it would probably need to be done once every three years, while the fecal occult blood test is usually done yearly. Savings over time on a more accurate test done fewer times could justify the higher cost of the Cologuard test, Ahlquist said.\n\nIn two other presentations at the meeting, researchers have linked key gene variants to the risk for colon cancer and also to the prognosis of the disease.\n\nIn one study, researchers found that people who have long telomeres, the small strips of DNA that cover the ends of chromosomes, have a 30 percent increased risk of developing colon cancer.\n\n""Even for people their age, their telomeres were longer than you\'d expect for healthy people,"" lead researcher Dr. Lisa A. Boardman, an associate professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic, said in a statement. ""This suggests that there may be two different mechanisms that affect telomere length and that set up susceptibility to cancer,"" she said.\n\nIn the other study, a research team led by Kim M. Smits, a molecular biologist and epidemiologist in the GROW-School for Oncology and Developmental Biology at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands, uncovered a surprise when it came to a gene variant on the KRAS gene called the G variant. This variant, long linked to poorer outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer, actually predicted a better prognosis in early-stage colon cancer.\n\n""You would intuitively think that the G variant would be associated with a poorer prognosis, as it is in late-stage colorectal cancer, but that is not the case,"" Smits said in a statement.\n\nExperts point out that studies presented at scientific meetings do not have to pass the rigorous peer review of studies published in reputable journals.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on colon cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.']",Health Day used the tired old line about the “Holy Grail.” So did the ,"Strengths:  a fairly good evaluation of the limitations of the evidence.
Weaknesses:  Nothing on harms.  Didn’t compare the new approach with another competing new technology (as the New York Times did).  But it also didn’t compare the new approach with existing colon cancer screening methods in a meaningful data-driven way.  So it failed to give readers a sense of the true scope of the potential benefits.

And desperate patients are shelling out thousands of dollars for treatment often not covered by health insurance, with scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks.\n\nChicago preschool teacher Lauren Pestikas long struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before trying ketamine earlier this year.\n\nThe price tag so far is about $3,000, but “it’s worth every dime and penny,” said the 36-year-old.\n\nPestikas said she feels much better for a few weeks after each treatment, but the effects wear off and she scrambles to find a way to pay for another one.\n\nFor now, ketamine has not received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating depression, though doctors can use it for that purpose.\n\nKetamine has been around since the 1960s and is widely used as an anesthesia drug during surgery because it doesn’t suppress breathing. Compared to opioids such as morphine, ketamine isn’t as addictive and doesn’t cause breathing problems. And some studies have shown that ketamine can ease symptoms within hours for the toughest cases.\n\nIts potential effects on depression were discovered in animal experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing that glutamate, a brain chemical messenger, might play a role in depression, and that drugs including ketamine that target the glutamate pathway might work as antidepressants.\n\nConventional antidepressants like Prozac target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in — a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair.\n\nKetamine’s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February.\n\n“We don’t have a lot of things that provide that kind of effect. What I worry about is that it gets so hyped up,” she said.\n\nThe strongest studies suggest it’s most useful and generally safe in providing short-term help for patients who have not benefited from antidepressants. That amounts to about one-third of the roughly 300 million people with depression worldwide.\n\n“It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs.\n\nBut to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known.\n\nLast year, Sanacora co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders that noted the benefits but said “major gaps” remain in knowledge about long-term effectiveness and safety. Most studies have been small, done in research settings and not in the real world.\n\nWhen delivered through an IV, ketamine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure that could be dangerous for some patients. Ketamine also can cause hallucinations that some patients find scary.\n\n“There are some very real concerns,” Sanacora said. “We do know this drug can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed.”\n\nDr. Rahul Khare, an emergency medicine specialist in Chicago, first learned about ketamine’s other potential benefits a decade ago from a depressed and anxious patient he was preparing to sedate to fix a repeat dislocated shoulder.\n\n“He said, ‘Doc, give me what I got last time. For about three weeks after I got it I felt so much better,’” Khare recalled.\n\nKhare became intrigued and earlier this year began offering ketamine for severe depression at an outpatient clinic he opened a few years ago. He also joined the American Society for Ketamine Physicians, formed a year ago representing about 140 U.S. doctors, nurses, psychologists and others using ketamine for depression or other nonapproved uses.\n\nThere are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley.\n\nKhare said the burgeoning field “is like a new frontier” where doctors gather at meetings and compare notes. He has treated about 50 patients with depression including Pestikas. They’re typically desperate for relief after failing to respond to other antidepressants. Some have lost jobs and relationships because of severe depression, and most find that ketamine allows them to function, Khare said.\n\nTypical treatment at his clinic involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that, covering Khare’s office visit cost. Patients can receive “booster” treatments. They must sign a four-page consent form that says benefits may not be long-lasting, lists potential side effects, and in bold letters states that the treatment is not government-approved.\n\nAt a recent session, Pestikas’s seventh, she leaned back on a reclining white examining-room chair as a nurse hooked her up to a heart and blood pressure monitor. She grimaced as a needle was slipped into the top of her left palm. Khare reached up with a syringe to inject a small dose of ketamine into an IV bag hanging above the chair, then dimmed the lights, pulled the window curtains and asked if she had questions and was feeling OK.\n\n“No questions, just grateful,” Pestikas replied, smiling.\n\nPestikas listened to music on her iPhone and watched psychedelic videos. She said it was like “a controlled acid trip” with pleasant hallucinations. The trip ends soon after the IV is removed, but Pestikas said she feels calm and relaxed the rest of the day, and that the mood boost can last weeks.\n\nStudies suggest that a single IV dose of ketamine far smaller than used for sedation or partying can help many patients gain relief within about four hours and lasting nearly a week or so.\n\nExactly how ketamine works is unclear, but one idea is that by elevating glutamate levels, ketamine helps nerve cells re-establish connections that were disabled by depression, said ketamine expert Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of experimental therapies at the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nA small Stanford University study published in August suggested that ketamine may help relieve depression by activating the brain’s opioid receptors.\n\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals and Allergan are among drug companies developing ketamine-like drugs for depression. Janssen leads the effort with its nasal spray esketamine. The company filed a new drug application in September.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of studies are underway seeking to answer some of the unknowns about ketamine including whether repeat IV treatments work better for depression and if there’s a way to zero in on which patients are most likely to benefit.\n\nUntil there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner .\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Lahita, chairman of medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey, told FoxNews.com. “Heating ducts that have mold and spores in them can make respiratory symptoms worse in the winter when hot air is blowing through them. Dry air can also exacerbate some illnesses and can be a problem as well.”\n\nDifferent sources of air pollution in your home could include paints that release lead or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carpets that harbor dirt, dust mites, and fungus and even nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, but these aren’t the worst culprits, Lahita said.\n\n“In the winter the biggest issue is carbon monoxide poisoning, with emergency medical services we see a few of these every year-- it is from faulty heaters, cooking without ventilation or fireplaces,” he said.\n\nEvery room in your house could be susceptive to some form of an air pollutant, but now there is a new device and app that says it can help you breathe easier by tracking air quality.\n\nAwair is the first smart air quality device that monitors, analyzes and provides feedback to improve the air you breathe. The device collects data such as indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, fine dust particles and VOCs. It analyzes the data in real-time and gives an Awair score on a 0 to 100 color-coded scale, 0 being the worst air quality.\n\n“The goal for the user is to keep five green dots. As soon as you see other colored (amber and red) dots show up on top of the green dots, your environment is getting off the healthy ranges whether it being temperature, humidity, CO2, VOCs, and dust,” Ronald Ro, the CEO and co-founder of Bitfinder Inc., the makers of Awair, told FoxNews.com.\n\nBased on your air score, the monitoring gadget will send personalized alerts and advice to the user via its corresponding Awair mobile app. When air conditions are harmful, like when a bedroom has a high carbon dioxide level, it will send a notification to the user and advise them to open up a window through the app. The app also provides Mayo Clinic “message cards” that give relevant information and recommendations for ways to keep your indoor environment healthy.\n\nIf you already have a smart device system for your home, Awair is working on partnerships with several connected devices like Nest thermostat and other smart appliances so you can manage the air quality in your home or office when you're not there.\n\nThe Awair app is free to download, but each device costs $199 dollars.\n\nFor more information go to GetAwair.com.""]",This story’s lack of quantified benefits — or any information about how accurate the device is — make it read more like a paid promotion than a news article.,"The story describes a device and related mobile app, called Awair, that monitors air quality in the home and reports the information to users. The story offers little information about how the device could actually benefit users. More importantly, the story makes the air in our homes sound positively terrifying, using language that seems aimed at making homeowners scared of everything from dust to dirty carpets. The lack of quantified benefits — or any information about how accurate the device is — make this story read more like a paid promotion than a news article.

A new study says it doesn't help,"['If taking more vitamin and mineral supplements is part of your plan for a healthier new year, a new study may prompt you to reconsider.\n\nResearchers who scoured the medical literature for evidence that calcium and vitamin D pills could help prevent bone fractures came up empty.\n\nTheir analysis focused on adults older than age 50 who lived on their own (that is, not in a nursing home or other type of residential care facility). Fractures are a serious health concern for this population — previous studies have found that about 40% of women in this age group will wind up with at least one “major osteoporotic fracture” at some point in their lives, and that among adults who break a hip, 20% died within a year of their injury.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Jia-Guo Zhao of Tianjin Hospital in northeastern China, combed through clinical trials, systematic reviews and other reports published in the last decade, since late 2006. They identified 51,145 people who were included in studies assessing the role of calcium and/or vitamin D in preventing bone fractures.\n\nTheir findings appear in Tuesday’s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.\n\nAmong the 14 trials that pitted calcium supplements against either a placebo or no treatment, there was no statistically significant relationship between use of the mineral (in pill form) and the risk of suffering a hip fracture. Nor was there any clear link between calcium supplements and fractures involving the spine or other bones.\n\nEven when the researchers accounted for each study participant’s gender, past history of bone fractures, the amount of calcium they consumed in their diets and the dose of the calcium pills they took (if they did), there was still no sign that supplements were helpful.\n\nAn additional 17 trials examined the role of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium. Once again, they found no statistically significant link between supplement use and hip fracture risk. Ditto for fractures in the spine and elsewhere.\n\nUpon drilling down to certain subgroups, they found that for people who started out with at least 20 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood, adding more vitamin D through supplements was associated with a greater risk of hip fractures. The same was true for people who took high doses of vitamin D supplements just once a year.\n\nFinally, there were 13 trials involving people who took a combined calcium-vitamin D supplement. As before, there was no statistically significant link between supplement use and the risk for any kind of fracture or combination of fractures. That held up even when accounting for gender, past fractures, supplement dose, dietary calcium or baseline blood levels of vitamin D.\n\nThe researchers noted that thousands of people in this final group were participants in the Women’s Health Initiative, a long-term study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the U.S. Earlier reports based on data gathered by the Women’s Health Initiative found that calcium and vitamin D supplements were associated with a lower risk of fractures, but only for women who took hormone therapy after menopause. To get a clearer picture of the direct link (if any) between supplements and fracture risk, Zhao and his colleagues opted not to include data from women on hormone therapy.\n\nIt’s still possible that calcium and vitamin D supplements are useful for people who live in nursing homes or other residential facilities, the study authors wrote. Such people are more likely to have osteoporosis, due to a combination of poor diet, less sun exposure (which the body needs to synthesize vitamin D) and other factors.\n\nBut for older adults who live on their own, they wrote, the results are clear: “These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements.”\n\nCAPTION Revelers joined community members and indigenous leaders from around the world at the Symbiosis Gathering in Big Summit Prairie, Ore., to mark the Great American Eclipse.

Reporting on a large review study, this Los Angeles Times article walks readers through the conflicting advice and evidence about calcium and vitamin D supplements. Both compounds play roles in bone health and the routinely accepted claim is that supplementation can help prevent bone breaks in older people.

Try Eating a Mediterranean Diet,"['Newswise — Eating a Mediterranean diet can slow down cognitive decline.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet can improve your mind, as well your heart, shows a study published in the open-access journal Frontiers in Nutrition.\n\nBy sticking to the Mediterranean diet the study showed that people had slowed rates of cognitive decline, reduced conversion to Alzheimer\'s, and improved cognitive function.\n\nThe main foods in the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) include plant foods, such as leafy greens, fresh fruit and vegetables, cereals, beans, seeds, nuts, and legumes. The MedDiet is also low in dairy, has minimal red meat, and uses olive oil as its major source of fat.\n\nLeading author Roy Hardman from the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology Swinburne University of Technology Melbourne Australia and his colleagues evaluated all the available papers between 2000-2015 that investigated if and how a MedDiet may impact cognitive processes over time. In total, 18 out of the 135 articles met their strict inclusion criteria.\n\n""The most surprising result was that the positive effects were found in countries around the whole world. So regardless of being located outside of what is considered the Mediterranean region, the positive cognitive effects of a higher adherence to a MedDiet were similar in all evaluated papers;"" he said.\n\nAttention, memory, and language improved. Memory, in particular, was positively affected by the MedDiet including improvements in: delayed recognition, long-term, and working memory, executive function, and visual constructs.\n\n""Why is a higher adherence to the MedDiet related to slowing down the rate of cognitive decline? The MedDiet offers the opportunity to change some of the modifiable risk factors,"" he explained.\n\n""These include reducing inflammatory responses, increasing micronutrients, improving vitamin and mineral imbalances, changing lipid profiles by using olive oils as the main source of dietary fats, maintaining weight and potentially reducing obesity, improving polyphenols in the blood, improving cellular energy metabolism and maybe changing the gut micro-biota, although this has not been examined to a larger extent yet.""\n\nMoreover, the benefits to cognition afforded by the MedDiet were not exclusive to older individuals. Two of the included studies focused on younger adults and they both found improvements in cognition using computerized assessments.\n\nThe researchers stress that research in this area is important due to the expected extensive population aging over the next 20-30 years. They envision that the utilization of a dietary pattern, such as the MedDiet, will be an essential tool to maintain quality of life and reduce the potential social and economic burdens of manifested cognitive declines like dementia.\n\n""I would therefore recommend people to try to adhere or switch to a MedDiet, even at an older age,"" Hardman added.\n\nLike many researchers, Hardman takes his research home: ""I follow the diet patterns and do not eat any red meats, chicken or pork. I have fish two-three times per week and adhere to a Mediterranean style of eating.""\n\nSEE ORIGINAL STUDY']","Devoid of quantification, this diet release lacks meat.","A review of a small number of studies examining impacts of the Mediterranean Diet finds that the diet is associated with both cognitive improvements and slower cognitive decline. The study is laudable in that it seeks to capture a bit of the “big picture” by examining the results of many studies, and focusing on 18 studies that met the researchers’ criteria for inclusion.
The challenges of pinning down the effects of diet are well known (see, for example, a recent article in the New York Times reflecting on these issues) so determining the actual benefits of the Mediterranean diet will take time and careful analysis. This news release is far more convinced of that linkage than is warranted.

But most of those fears are related to the use of a combination of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which are prescribed to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and have been shown to increase a woman’s risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women’s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. Nationwide, about one-third of women in their 50s have had a hysterectomy.\n\nThe Women’s Health Initiative was begun in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health as a sweeping investigation of hormone use and other health issues of postmenopausal women.\n\n\n\nWhile most women in the hormone study were taking combination hormone therapy, women without a uterus took estrogen alone or a placebo for about six years and were followed for nearly 11 years. The estrogen-only group was not given progestin, which is prescribed only to protect the uterus from the harmful effects of estrogen. Although all the women in the estrogen study stopped using the treatment in 2004, the investigators have continued to monitor their health, as is typical in large clinical trials.\n\nThe most surprising new finding relates to breast cancer. The women with hysterectomies who used estrogen alone had a 23 percent lower risk for breast cancer compared with those who had taken a placebo. This is in stark contrast to the higher risk of breast cancer shown in the estrogen-progestin part of the trial.\n\n“The decreased risk of breast cancer in this group is something we totally didn’t expect when we started the W.H.I. hormone therapy trials,” said Andrea Z. LaCroix, the study’s lead author and a professor of epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. “This study differentiates estrogen alone from estrogen and progestin in a very big way. I hope it gets across to women, because we are not reversing ourselves.”\n\nIndeed, the investigators emphasized that the results do not change recommendations concerning combination hormone therapy for the two-thirds of menopausal women who still have a uterus. The Women’s Health Initiative data have consistently shown that the combination of estrogen and progestin raises breast cancer risk, and that the treatment should be used only to relieve severe menopause symptoms, using the lowest dose for the shortest possible time.\n\nBut the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.\n\nAn accompanying editorial in the journal was skeptical about the results, arguing that the design of the initiative, which is skewed toward older women and stopped all forms of hormone treatment after several years of use, does not match the way doctors typically prescribe treatment to women in their 50s at the onset of menopause.\n\nDr. Graham Colditz, an author of the editorial and professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he thought data collected from observational studies that show a higher risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen use were more reliable than the data gathered from the Women’s Health Initiative clinical trial.\n\n“The finding doesn’t reflect how hormones are used in the U.S. at the moment,” Dr. Colditz said.\n\nThe trial has, however, been held up for years as the gold standard for medical research, and its findings linking combination hormones to breast cancer and heart problems led to significant changes in the way doctors around the world treated menopause.\n\nA major caveat in interpreting the new estrogen data is that the study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are estrogen compounds derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the brand Premarin. The brand has fallen out of favor with many women who are choosing treatments that contain estradiol, which is chemically similar to a woman’s natural estrogen. It is not known whether the benefits of estrogen shown in the Women’s Health Initiative would be replicated using a different type of estrogen.\n\nNobody knows why estrogen treatment alone appeared to lower breast cancer risk in the study, but one explanation may be that in menopausal women with low levels of natural estrogen, the effects of estrogen drugs induce cell death in existing tumors. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease.\n\n“We need to look closely at these findings to see if we can learn more about ways to prevent breast cancer in women,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Women’s Health Initiative investigator and an author of the study who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nIn the final analysis of the estrogen-only trial, use of the hormone was not associated with any significant risks or benefits pertaining to blood clots, stroke, hip fracture, colon cancer or overall death rates.\n\nBut there were surprising differences in the risks and benefits of estrogen use on heart risk when comparing the youngest and oldest women in the study. Women who were in their 50s when they first started using estrogen also had significantly fewer heart risks, including almost 50 percent fewer heart attacks, compared with those assigned to the placebo group.\n\nThe data indicate that for every 10,000 women in their 50s, those using estrogen would experience 12 fewer heart attacks, 13 fewer deaths and 18 fewer adverse events like blood clots or stroke in a given year, compared with those taking a placebo.\n\nBut the risks of estrogen use were pronounced in older women. For every 10,000 women in their 70s, using estrogen would cause 16 extra heart attacks, 19 extra deaths and 48 serious adverse events.\n\n“The big message there is that the data look much more favorable for younger women and much riskier for older women,” said Dr. LaCroix.\n\nDr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman’s health status, her age and the type of hormone used.\n\nDr. Chlebowski previously led research that showed cancer risks associated with combination hormone therapy, but he says the new data on estrogen alone show that in certain women, estrogen use to relieve menopausal symptoms is a “good choice.”\n\n“When you look at the debate, people are saying hormones are good or not good — it’s been all or nothing. This calls attention to the fact that there are differences,” Dr. Chlebowski said. “I hope that separation will become clearer now.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article appeared in print on Wednesday, April 6, 2011 on page A1.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Careful reporting of a medical journal article that gives consumers plenty of nuance to chew over.</span>","The New York Times provides vital context for this discussion of estrogen use after menopause.

For people who worked out more, no additional benefits were observed.\n\nThe study could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and the risk of depression, but the authors say it strongly suggests one—especially because they controlled for other potential factors, including age, gender, social support, smoking, drinking and body mass index.\n\nIf their hypothesis is right, they say, 12% of depression cases could be prevented if everyone got just one hour of exercise a week.\n\nThat exercise doesn’t have to be intense, either, they say. People seemed to have mental health benefits from physical activity regardless of whether they reported working out to the point of exhaustion or barely breaking a sweat.\n\nMORE: 7 Surprising Benefits of Exercise\n\n“Given that the intensity of exercise does not appear to be important,” the authors wrote in their paper, “it may be that the most effective public health measures are those that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday activities, such as walking or cycling.”\n\nOf course, there are other benefits to more frequent and more intense bouts of exercise. Both the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization recommend getting at least 150 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity physical activity a week for cardiovascular and overall health.\n\nBut when it comes to mental health benefits, “the majority of the protective effect comes from the first one or two hours of exercise each week,” said study author Samuel Harvey, associate professor of workplace mental health at the Black Dog Institute and the University of New South Wales, in an email.\n\nMORE: A New Hope For Depression\n\nThe authors write that the combined physical and social benefits of exercise are likely responsible for its ability to help stave off depression. It’s also possible, they add, that exercise may trigger changes in self-esteem, the release of mood-boosting endorphins and the production of certain proteins.\n\n“There is good evidence that physical activity can help people recover from depression, though we recommend it be used in addition to the usual treatments we would prescribe for established depression, like medication and counseling,” says Harvey. “Our study takes this a bit further and shows that exercise may also have a role in preventing people developing depression in the first place.”\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.']",The story also would have benefitted from an independent source to comment on the findings.,"This Time magazine story describes a large study that looked at survey data from Norway to determine if exercise played a role in reducing the risk of developing depression among the 22,000 participants.

They show, for the first time in an animal model, that tau pathology - the second-most important lesion in the brain in patients with Alzheimer\'s disease - can be reversed by a drug.\n\n""We show that we can intervene after disease is established and pharmacologically rescue mice that have tau-induced memory deficits,"" explained senior investigator Domenico Praticò, MD, Scott Richards North Star Foundation Chair for Alzheimer\'s Research, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology, and Director of the Alzheimer\'s Center at Temple at LKSOM. The study, published online in the journal Molecular Neurobiology, raises new hope for human patients affected by dementia.\n\nThe researchers landed on their breakthrough after discovering that inflammatory molecules known as leukotrienes are deregulated in Alzheimer\'s disease and related dementias. In experiments in animals, they found that the leukotriene pathway plays an especially important role in the later stages of disease.\n\n""At the onset of dementia, leukotrienes attempt to protect nerve cells, but over the long term, they cause damage,"" Dr. Praticò said. ""Having discovered this, we wanted to know whether blocking leukotrienes could reverse the damage, whether we could do something to fix memory and learning impairments in mice having already abundant tau pathology.""\n\nTo recapitulate the clinical situation of dementia in humans, in which patients are already symptomatic by the time they are diagnosed, Dr. Praticò and colleagues used specially engineered tau transgenic mice, which develop tau pathology - characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, disrupted synapses (the junctions between neurons that allow them to communicate with one another), and declines in memory and learning ability - as they age. When the animals were 12 months old, the equivalent of age 60 in humans, they were treated with zileuton, a drug that inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme.\n\nAfter 16 weeks of treatment, animals were administered maze tests to assess their working memory and their spatial learning memory. Compared with untreated animals, tau mice that had received zileuton performed significantly better on the tests. Their superior performance suggested a successful reversal of memory deficiency.\n\nTo determine why this happened, the researchers first analyzed leukotriene levels. They found that treated tau mice experienced a 90-percent reduction in leukotrienes compared with untreated mice. In addition, levels of phosphorylated and insoluble tau, the form of the protein that is known to directly damage synapses, were 50 percent lower in treated animals. Microscopic examination revealed vast differences in synaptic integrity between the groups of mice. Whereas untreated animals had severe synaptic deterioration, the synapses of treated tau animals were indistinguishable from those of ordinary mice without the disease.\n\n""Inflammation was completely gone from tau mice treated with the drug,"" Dr. Praticò said. ""The therapy shut down inflammatory processes in the brain, allowing the tau damage to be reversed.""\n\nThe study is especially exciting because zileuton is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma. ""Leukotrienes are in the lungs and the brain, but we now know that in addition to their functional role in asthma, they also have a functional role in dementia,"" Dr. Praticò explained.\n\n""This is an old drug for a new disease,"" he added. ""The research could soon be translated to the clinic, to human patients with Alzheimer\'s disease.""\n\n###\n\nOther researchers contributing to the study include Phillip F. Giannopoulos and Jian Chiu at the Alzheimer\'s Center at Temple, LKSOM.\n\nThe research was funded in part by grants from The Wanda Simone Endowment for Neuroscience and the Scott Richards North Star Charitable Foundation.\n\nAbout Temple Health\n\nTemple University Health System (TUHS) is a $2.1 billion academic health system dedicated to providing access to quality patient care and supporting excellence in medical education and research.

The drug, an anti-leukotriene steroid called zileuton, is believed to target the biological pathways involved with damage to “tau” nerve cells in the brain. That damage leads to the fiber-like “tangles” that are suspected of sabotaging the chemical signaling between brain cells needed for learning and memory.
We applaud the release for including the words “in mice” in the headline, something that our reviewers have called the university out for previously. The release would have been strengthened by explicitly addressing the long road still to travel between reversal of tau damage in designer mice and a potential treatment to restore spatial or any other kind of memory in people. A quote noting that the work “could soon be translated” to clinical use was buried at the end of the release, but still left a potentially misleading impression. It also does not mention cost or side effects. The use of  use of words like “breakthrough,” and a phrase about “new hope” for patients,  detract from the otherwise balanced release.

Robotic nephrectomy for inferior vena cava tumor thrombus has favorable outcomes in selected patients compared with open surgery, which can have a high rate of complications, report surgeons in The Journal of Urology®.\n\nRenal vein surgery can often be managed with minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, but this is not typically advisable for an IVC thrombus (a fibrous clot), which is surgically far more complex with potentially fatal complications that can occur in the course of removing the thrombus and reconstructing the IVC.\n\nThe first known procedure using robotic surgery of renal tumors with IVC tumor thrombi was performed in 2008. Experts from nine leading U.S. medical centers report here on their combined experience of 32 cases since 2008. Each surgeon performed between one and ten procedures for IVC tumor thrombi which ranged from one to 11 cm in length on preoperative imaging. Patient age ranged from 43 to 80 years.\n\nThe IVC required cross-clamping in 24 cases. One patient had two renal veins with two caval thrombi and one patient required a synthetic patch. Surgeries lasted from three to seven hours. None of the operations was converted to open surgery and all but two patients were ambulatory on the day of or day after surgery. Twenty-one patients resumed regular diets the day after surgery. Eight patients had node positive disease and seven patients had distant recurrence 15 months later including four of those with node positive disease.\n\n""This is a complex condition and the complication rate with open surgery is 12% to 47%, depending on the thrombus level, with a mortality rate of 5% to 10%,"" explained lead investigator Ronney Abaza, MD, Robotic Surgery Director at OhioHealth Dublin Methodist Hospital. ""Using robotic nephrectomy, our complication rate and lack of mortalities compare reasonably with open series with no grade III to V complications, according to the Clavien system, in any patient, including no deaths.""\n\nDr Abaza added, ""While complications were relatively minor in our series, it is evident that complications are not entirely avoidable. Even with a minimally invasive approach, the surgical management of severe cancers in mostly elderly patients will likely involve complications. However, despite the complex and critical nature of these procedures, our series demonstrates favorable outcomes and reproducibility by surgeons with adequate robotic experience.""\n\n###']",Benefits of complex robotic procedure remain unclear when presented in a news release that only tells part of the story.,"This news release describes a study published in the The Journal of Urology whose findings suggest that “robotic nephrectomy” — robotic surgery to remove all or part of a kidney — has higher success rates than traditional open surgery when treating patients for complex clots and tumors associated with renal cell carcinoma. The study is a retrospective look at 32 individual robotic nephrectomy surgeries performed by nine surgeons, beginning with the first in 2008. The case studies involved surgeries performed on patients with inferior vena cava (IVC) tumors ranging from 1 to 11 centimeters in length. The release may have done a bit of a disservice to the quality of the research and the published results. It reads somewhat more promotional than informational and misses the mark on some of our criteria, including costs and quantification of the benefits. It offers some caution when describing the study’s limitations that could be helpful to readers, but the caution stated by the lead researcher in the journal manuscript itself was clearer and stronger.

This is why the promise of a vaccine would be extremely beneficial, says David Bulir, co-author of the study.\n\n""Vaccine development efforts in the past three decades have been unproductive and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans,"" said Bulir, who just finished his PhD in medical sciences at McMaster.\n\n""Vaccination would be the best way to way to prevent a chlamydia infection, and this study has identified important new antigens which could be used as part of a vaccine to prevent or eliminate the damaging reproductive consequences of untreated infections.""\n\nIn the research team\'s study, BD584 was able to reduce chlamydial shedding - a symptom of C. trachomatis - by 95 per cent. The antigen also decreased hydrosalpinx, another C. trachomatis symptom which involves fallopian tubes being blocked with serous fluids, by 87.5 per cent.\n\nThe results look very promising, said senior author James Mahony, a professor of Pathology and Molecular Medicine for McMaster\'s Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine and a researcher at St. Joseph Healthcare Hamilton\'s Research Institute where the work was performed.\n\nCo-author and McMaster PhD student, Steven Liang, explains, ""not only is the vaccine effective, it also has the potential to be widely protective against all C. trachomatis strains, including those that cause trachoma.""\n\nTrachoma is an eye infection caused by chlamydia and is the leading cause of preventable blindness affecting millions of people in many resource-poor regions of the world.\n\n""The vaccine would be administered through the nose. This is easy and painless and does not require highly trained health professionals to administer, and that makes it an inexpensive solution for developing nations,"" he said.\n\nThe next step is more testing for effectiveness against different strains of Chlamydia and in different formulations.

(Embargoed until 12:30 p.m., June 8, 2015) - A novel radionuclide drug tackles the challenge of prostate cancer imaging and takes a turn as a cancer-killing therapy for tumors in and out of the prostate, according to research presented during the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI).\n\nThe drug works by delivering diagnostic- or therapy-grade radionuclides to cells that express a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), found on the surface of prostate cancer cells and their metastatic counterparts throughout the body. Clinicians can diagnose or stage disease and monitor therapy with the aid of a special hybrid scanner used to perform minimally invasive positron emission tomography (PET).\n\n""Prostate cancer still represents one of the main causes for cancer-related deaths among men,"" said Matthias Eder, PhD, co-author of the study and a researcher in the division of radiopharmaceutical chemistry at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. ""The diagnosis and therapy of metastatic prostate cancer is still challenging. The current clinical methods are not sensitive enough for detecting disease beyond the prostate, but we are convinced that this novel theranostic radiotracer represents a significant step forward that could have a major impact on the future of prostate cancer care.""\n\nThe PSMA-inhibiting theranostic agent, called PSMA-617, is still in its initial stages, but it could be ideal for the treatment of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancers, which are notoriously difficult to control and linked to poor prognosis. Options for these patients are few, and they come with substantial adverse effects. Diagnosis and therapy with the theranostic agent PSMA-617 could offer more effective and sensitive visualization, better staging and significantly higher therapeutic potential. To be clear, other PSMA-based theranostics have reached the research bench, but previous contenders had too many limitations in terms of instability in live subjects, a lack of imaging contrast between targeted tissue and background signal and increased PSMA-associated binding to normal organs such as the kidneys. This new radionuclide drug shows strong binding to the protein PSMA and is readily and safely taken up by malignant PSMA-positive tumors. PSMA-617 could represent a watershed moment for prostate cancer theranostics.\n\nFor this research, scientists first imaged mice with an imaging-grade radionuclide, gallium-68, to assess the diagnostic value of PSMA-617. Diagnostic imaging was followed by a therapy-grade radionuclide, lutetium-177, which delivers a more powerful dose of radiation that penetrates and destroys the cells and tissues of tumors when combined with PSMA-617. This phase was followed by a first-in-human clinical trial of both imaging and therapy in a single person.\n\nResults of the human study showed that imaging was effective for the evaluation of metastatic prostate cancer, and subsequent therapy resulted in a drop in prostate-specific antigen levels from 38.0 to 4.6 nanograms per milliliter. Positive response to therapy was verified via combined PET and computed tomography (PET/CT), a hybrid imaging system that shows both functional and structural aspects of the body.\n\nApproximately one out of seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, according to 2015 statistics from the American Cancer Society. About 220,800 new prostate cancer diagnoses and 27,540 prostate-cancer-related deaths are expected to occur in the U.S. this year.\n\n###\n\nScientific Paper 63: ""PSMA-617 - a novel theranostic PSMA inhibitor for both diagnosis and endoradiotherapy of prostate cancer,"" M. Benesova, M. Schäfer, U. Bauder-Wüst, K. Kopka, M. Eder, Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; C. Kratochwil, A. Afshar-Oromieh, W. Mier, U. Haberkorn, Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; SNMMI\'s 62nd Annual Meeting, June 6-10, 2015, Baltimore, Md.\n\nAbout the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging\n\nThe Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) is an international scientific and medical organization dedicated to raising public awareness about nuclear medicine and molecular imaging, a vital element of today\'s medical practice that adds an additional dimension to diagnosis, changing the way common and devastating diseases are understood and treated and helping provide patients with the best health care possible.']","The frothy language in this release — “new hope,” “watershed moment,” “major impact,” – doesn’t square up with the reality that only one patient was treated, and we don’t know if he benefited in any meaningful way.","This news release reports on a paper presented at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging on a radionuclide drug that could be used both for imaging and therapy in advanced prostate cancer. The drug works by targeting cells that produce a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen and varying dosages can either be used for radio imaging or to target cancer cells. An initial trial of this drug yielded a drop in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels from 38.0 to 4.6 nanograms per milliliter. This result was verified by PET scan and computed tomography.
These results could certainly warrant a news release calling attention to this novel research. However, we thought the execution could have been handled more carefully. Our main concern with this release is the disparity between the language used — for example, the headline touts “new hope for advanced prostate cancer” — and the actual research, which is based on treatment of a single person resulting in a drop in PSA levels. The release takes five paragraphs to tell us that the study involved only one person; it omits important details about his treatment; and it didn’t mention how long he lived or if, indeed, he is still alive. That’s a flimsy foundation for anyone with advanced prostate cancer to base their hopes.

Pooling data from 522 trials including nearly 120,000 patients, researchers found all drugs analysed were more effective than placebos in the treatment of adults with acute depression.\n\nAuthors of the study—published yesterday in the Lancet—believe many more people could benefit from antidepressant medication.\n\nThe study results represent the most comprehensive evidence currently available, they wrote.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nStephen Chernin/Getty Images\n\nMore than 300 million people worldwide have depression, according to the World Health Organization, of which less than half recieve effective treatments. In many countries, the rate drops to less than 10 percent.\n\nIn the U.S., the National Institute of Mental Health estimates 16.2 million adults experienced at least one major depressive episode in 2016. Approximately 37 percent of these people received no treatment.\n\nIn the U.K, where a number of the study authors are based, at least one million more people could benefit from drugs or psychotherapy, senior author John Geddes said.\n\nSome drugs more effective than others\n\nThe researchers analyzed existing studies of 21 different drugs, and found some were much more effective than others.\n\nDrugs ranged from more than one third more effective than a placebo to more than twice as effective. The best performers included amitriptyline and escitalopram, while the worst included fluoxetine—commonly sold under the trade name Prozac—and reboxetine, which is not approved for sale in the U.S.\n\nA complex treatment picture\n\nThe results add up to a complex treatment picture for what authors called “one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults.”\n\nAntidepressants do not improve symptoms in about 40 percent of people, study author Andrea Cipriani of Oxford University told a press briefing.\n\nWhile these results should reassure many people with depression that antidepressants can be effective, “this does not necessarily mean antidepressants should always be the first line of treatment,” he said.\n\nTalking therapies are thought to be about as effective as antidepressant medication, but these are often much more expensive.\n\nExperts not involved in the research agreed the results were significant.\n\nHelen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the U.K.’s Royal College of GPs, expressed concern about the stigma surrounding antidepressant use.\n\nShe said in a statement: “Taking antidepressants is frequently portrayed as a negative thing or something done only when other therapies are not available or have failed, but this in itself can add to the unfortunate stigma that sometimes exists around people with mental health conditions.”\n\nBut she also urged caution. “Although antidepressants are of proven benefit—as this study shows,” she said, “no doctor wants their patients to become reliant on medication.”\n\nPutting a long-held controversy to bed\n\nCarmine Pariante, a professor at the UK’s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience and spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the study ""finally puts to bed the controversy on antidepressants.""\n\nJames Warner, an Imperial College London psychiatrist, added: “Depression causes misery to countless thousands every year and this study adds to the existing evidence that effective treatments are available.”']","This story also missed harms, evidence limitations, and a conflict of interest.","This Newsweek story covers an analysis of the best available trial data to attain a high-level assessment of 21 antidepressant medications.
The story gives good context about how prevalent depression is and how many people go without treatment of any kind, and reminds us that psychotherapy is also a viable treatment.
And yet the headline goes far beyond the scope of the study by claiming that “many more people” should take antidepressants. That assertion isn’t supported by anything in the story itself, and it’s a major misstep in our view, as treatment decisions should always be fully-informed, shared encounters between people and their physicians.
The story didn’t alert readers that most antidepressants were found to offer only a modest benefit, and side effects weren’t considered.
The story also missed study limitations and a conflict of interest for one of the people quoted.

Founded in 1957, it struggled for decades to find uses for the product, almost going out of business before licensing the drug to Auxilium in 2004.\n\n“It sort of proves to people that if you really believe in a drug you should never give up,” said Matthew Geller, a biotechnology investment banker who is a member of the BioSpecifics board.\n\nShares of BioSpecifics closed Monday at $27.61, up from $1 as recently as late 2006.\n\nSome people treated with Xiaflex in clinical trials for the Dupuytren’s hand condition said it had made a big difference in their lives, and had allowed them to avoid painful surgery.\n\nPhoto\n\n“When I looked down and saw my finger straightened out, I cried,” said Kenneth Nelson, 65, of Indianapolis. “It was to me just like a miracle.”\n\nXiaflex is an enzyme produced by a gangrene-causing bacterium, Clostridium histolyticum, which uses it to eat away the tissues of its victims. The enzyme, called collagenase, breaks down collagen, a major component of the body’s connective tissue that is found in skin, tendons, cartilage and other organs.\n\nBut collagenase by itself does not cause gangrene. And there are times doctors need to break down collagen, such as when an excess builds up in the hand or penis, causing Dupuytren’s and Peyronie’s. The ailments are named for French surgeons who described the conditions in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe enzyme was first extracted from the bacteria around 1950 by Ines Mandl, a young biochemist at Columbia University. Edwin H. Wegman, a Long Island entrepreneur, learned about Dr. Mandl’s work and set up a company called Advance Biofactures, which later became BioSpecifics, to turn collagenase into a drug.\n\nIn 1965, the company won approval of an ointment containing collagenase for use in removing dead tissue from skin ulcers and burns. The ointment, sold by licensees under the name Santyl, was a modest success, but the company never truly prospered.\n\nSo in the 1970s the company began developing what it thought would be a bigger money-maker, an injectable collagenase. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. Finally, in the early 1990s, two professors of orthopedics at the nearby State University of New York at Stony Brook suggested using the drug for Dupuytren’s.\n\nThe professors, Dr. Lawrence C. Hurst and Marie A. Badalamente, injected the drug into the tails of rats, as a stand-in for human fingers. They found they could dissolve the collagen in tendons, making the tails floppy, without harming nearby nerves and arteries. Then they organized clinical trials in patients and got federal grants to help pay for the work. The professors and Stony Brook will share a royalty of one half of 1 percent of sales of Xiaflex for use in treating Dupuytren’s.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In desperation, Ed Wegman’s son Mark, a top computer scientist at I.B.M., called a childhood friend, Laurence Korn, who had been the chief executive of a successful biotechnology company now known as PDL BioPharma.\n\nWith Dr. Korn’s help, BioSpecifics licensed the drug to Auxilium in a matter of weeks, receiving $5 million initially.\n\nAuxilium was interested because of Peyronie’s disease. It already was selling a gel for men with low testosterone and had learned from urologists about the need for better treatments for bent penises.\n\nPhoto\n\n“From talking with surgeons and patients who have Peyronie’s, neither of them wants to do the surgery,” said Will Sargent, a spokesman for Auxilium.\n\nTwo years ago, the drug giant Pfizer, which sells the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, licensed the European rights to Xiaflex from Auxilium for an initial payment of $75 million. BioSpecifics got $6.4 million of that amount and will receive 8.5 percent of additional payments of up to $410 million that Pfizer might make.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAuxilium sought approval for treating Dupuytren’s first because it was easier to measure success in straightening fingers. But the company hopes to begin late-stage trials of Xiaflex for Peyronie’s disease later this year. In a midstage trial, injections of Xiaflex into the collagen plaque in the penis reduced the curvature. But the drug did not reduce pain or discomfort during intercourse by a statistically significant amount.\n\nWhile collagenase itself is not patented, the companies do have patents on the use of the enzyme to treat Dupuytren’s and Peyronie’s.

Many women with depression faced a difficult decision: continue their medication during pregnancy, potentially putting their child at risk, or jeopardize their own mental health by going off the drugs.\n\nThe FDA advisory pointed to a single study showing a six-fold increased risk of a condition called persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns whose mothers were taking antidepressants.\n\nBut now a new, large-scale study finds that the risk is negligible -- much lower than previously believed, reports CBS Boston\'s Dr. Mallika Marshall.\n\nResearchers at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston looked at 3.8 million pregnant women nationwide and found that those taking popular antidepressants, called SSRIs, did not appear to be at significantly increased risk of having a baby with pulmonary hypertension.\n\n""The risk increase of taking antidepressants late in pregnancy, if present, is much more modest than previous studies have found,"" says Krista Huybrechts, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital. ""So for women with severe debilitating depression that is not responsive to other non-pharmacological treatments, this should be reassuring information.""\n\nIt\'s certainly reassuring news for Dr. Katherine Economy, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at the Brigham who cares for many pregnant women on antidepressants.\n\n""They take them because they have a disease that impacts their daily life,"" Economy says. ""And for many women, they cannot get through their daily activities, getting out of bed, taking a shower, and preparing food for themselves. So for many of these women, these medications are life-saving and life-altering.""\n\nDr. Economy warns patients about the potential risks like withdrawal in the newborn and a small risk of heart defects, but says for many women, the worst time to stop their medications is at the end of pregnancy when postpartum depression becomes a concern.\n\n""My basic message is that, overall, there may be some slight risks associated with the medication, but in balancing risks and benefits for most women, I would suggest they stay on their medication,"" she said.']",The story about antidepressants in pregnancy could have done a better job of explaining the FDA’s “six-fold increase” in risk to newborns and showing the actual rates observed in the new study.,"This story covers a new study that partially uproots a concern that doctors and pregnant women alike have faced since before 2006: taking certain antidepressants during pregnancy. Called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, these drugs can alleviate common symptoms of depression that some pregnant women may grapple with. The text story and accompanying video touch on the quality of evidence (i.e. a huge sample size of millions of women), and the story appropriately highlights the slight risks to newborns in pregnant women who take SSRIs. Commentary from an expert not involved with the study adds important context to the coverage. The story could have done a better job of explaining the FDA’s concerns about a “six-fold increase” in risk to newborns and showing the actual rates observed in the new study. More information on the harms of not taking SSRIs, as well as potential alternatives to SSRIs, would also have been welcome. A HealthDay story on the same study provided more of the information that we were looking for.

The trial was funded by Pfizer.\n\nWomen in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group took a median of 9.5 months to progress, as measured by CT and MRI scans, compared with 4.6 months in the placebo group.\n\nSome 67 per cent of the 347 women in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group showed clinical benefit - either a reduction in tumour size or control of disease for at least six months - compared with 40 per cent of the 174 women in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.\n\nSome 19 per cent in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group had a decrease in tumour size compared with 9 per cent in the placebo plus fulvestrant group.\n\nThe study also aimed to assess whether cancers with particular genetic traits responded less well or better to the combination than others.\n\nMutations to the gene PIK3CA represent the most common genetic event in breast cancer, and mutations in the gene are associated with a shorter response to hormone therapy.\n\nThe research showed that using \'liquid biopsies\' that measure cancer DNA circulating in the blood to detect PIK3CA, and tests for blood hormone levels, the palbociclib combination worked in all types of hormone-receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.\n\nPalbociclib is a first-in-class drug - with a different mechanism of action to other approved drugs - which simultaneously blocks two proteins called CDK4 and CDK6 in cancer cells. It causes less severe side-effects than traditional chemotherapy.\n\nIn the trial, severe side-effects caused by the combination were rare. Many women (81 per cent on the palbociclib arm) had a drop in their white blood cell count, but this rarely led to serious symptoms.\n\nStudy co-lead author Dr Nicolas Turner, Team Leader in Molecular Oncology at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant Medical Oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said:\n\n""Our research underlines the effectiveness of palbociclib with fulvestrant in metastatic breast cancer and, importantly, demonstrates its benefit in all types of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We hope our results lead to the adoption of this drug combination in breast cancer, where it delays the need to start chemotherapy by an average of nine months.\n\n""Our study also sends a powerful message that in combining new drugs in innovative trials we can find better options for women with advanced breast cancer. Chemotherapy can add several months to life but it comes at a cost of often life-limiting side effects, and we need alternative treatments that are better tolerated to treat patients with advanced breast cancer.""\n\nProfessor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said:\n\n""If we\'re going to drive further improvements in survival from cancer, it\'s essential that we find ways of prolonging life in people whose cancers have evolved and become resistant to treatment. This trial is an exciting example of one of the most promising approaches to overcoming drug resistance, by combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to block off cancer\'s escape routes. It\'s very encouraging to see such substantial delays to cancer progression.""\n\n###\n\nNotes to editors\n\nFor more information please contact Henry French on 020 7153 5582 or henry.french@icr.ac.uk.

The release provides data on the drug combo’s effect on time to progression, which may be a clinically important measure. But women also want to know if it will help them live longer, and this news release doesn’t address that. The release has some strong points, including clear reporting and useful information on how the drug combination compares with alternative therapies. Its main weaknesses were downplaying the side effects and omitting the cost of these very pricey drugs.
[Editor’s Note/Correction: Following publication of this review, a public relations representative that works with AstraZeneca pointed out that the drugs are co-administered, not combined into one drug. That wasn’t made clear in the news release which referred simply to “the combination” or a “combination of two drugs.” We’ve since revised the summary text to read that the study refers to a combination of drugs rather than a combination drug.
In addition, the news release didn’t include the drugs’ costs, so we did an online search in order to give readers a sense of the price. We provided reputable sources for the cost information. AstraZeneca’s representative disputed the cost estimate of $11,899/month and said the wholesale cost for fulvestrant 500 MG is $1,845/month. That cost appears to be accurate whereas the source we referenced was incorrect. We’ve updated that section of the review accordingly.  Cost to patients will vary according to their insurance coverage.
We’ve also revised the cost section to reflect that a source noted that palbociclib could “potentially” be one of the top 10 most expensive drugs, not that it currently exists on such a list.]

Tyler Kalajian and his research team, led by Dr. Michael F. Holick, Ph.D., M.D., and supported by Boston University School of Medicine and a Boston University Ignition Award, found that skin samples exposed to RayVio\'s UV LED for just 0.52 minutes produced more than twice as much vitamin D3 as samples exposed to 32.5 minutes of sunlight.\n\n""We tested ultraviolet LEDs from different sources and at different wavelengths.

A vitamin D3 producing UV LED device could be used on skin areas that experience less exposure to sunlight such as upper legs and arms and abdomen and back thus minimizing risk for developing non-melanoma skin cancer.

These lights are also a safer alternative than sunlight, the news release claims.
However, the release offers no caution that findings from in vitro skin samples may not necessarily be replicated in living humans and that larger studies are needed to show if the lights make a difference in actual health outcomes that people care about.
We also wish the release had been more cautious in discussing the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. There’s disagreement among experts over the rate of deficiency, and the effects of vitamin D on conditions other than bone loss needs more research.

Ms. Imhof, a lawyer, was afraid that blow-drying her straight dark hair would hasten the shedding, so she got up two hours early to shower and apply mousse and volumizers.

To its credit, the story acknowledges that there’s no published research behind this treatment and quotes an independent dermatologist saying she can’t recommend the product to patients. It helpfully reports that the company differentiates itself by selecting customers who are likely to comply with the time-consuming treatment regime and by tracking customers’ hair growth, along with the fact that positive results may stem from the fact that most customers are women, who can lose hair due to hormonal changes and see it grow back naturally, without treatment.
But those caveats come in the last half of the story, after a positive anecdote and language that reads like marketing copy. Also, the headline is farfetched in suggesting this mystery potion might constitute a “cure” for hair loss.

""But the dose [given] is a lot more than conventionally given for any condition.""\n\nThe study was published Feb. 27 in the Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nIn the study, 40 Italian women were split into two groups: one receiving a single oral dose of 300,000 IUs of vitamin D3 and the other getting a placebo five days before the expected start of their menstrual periods.\n\nAfter two months, average pain scores dropped 41 percent for women assigned vitamin D treatment, while no difference in pain was reported in the placebo group.\n\nAlso, the women who took vitamin D reported no need to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as the pain reliever ibuprofen, to manage their pain in the two-month study period, while 40 percent of those assigned to placebo reported using an NSAID at least once.\n\nMenstrual cramps, known by the medical name dysmenorrhea, typically begin just before or at the start of a woman\'s menstrual period and can last several days. Experts attribute the pelvic pain to prostaglandins, a hormone-like substance that contributes to the contraction and relaxation of muscles and blood vessels.\n\nVitamin D3 apparently helped hamper prostaglandin production in study participants, easing their pain, said Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. The vitamin is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects, Rabin added.\n\n""The bottom line is, it looked like it worked,"" said Rabin, also head of urogynecology at the hospital. ""It was a very well-done study, but my comment is, it was one study. It asks more questions than it answers, which is the sign of a good trial.""\n\nThe 300,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 given in the study also far exceeds the daily intake of 600 IUs recommended for American women of reproductive age, both Graham and Rabin said. And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects.\n\nCurrently used methods of controlling menstrual cramps include NSAIDs and -- among those with severe pain -- birth control pills. But both have potential risks: NSAID users can experience stomach or kidney troubles, for example, while birth control pills are linked to blood clots in certain women. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies.\n\nVitamin D use has also been widely studied as a possible preventive for many other conditions, including heart disease, certain cancers and autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe Italian study participants all had blood levels of vitamin D measuring in the lowest 25 percent of normal at the study\'s outset, although the researchers didn\'t report the womens\' blood levels afterward. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study.\n\nGraham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.\n\n""From a symptomatic standpoint, it\'s something to be considered, but more studies are needed to see the risks and benefits,"" Graham said. ""Studies like this are starting to show that vitamin D is ubiquitous in receptors in our bodies . . . but it needs further explanation.""\n\nMore information\n\nTo find out more about painful menstrual periods, head to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","Overall, a serviceable story with a few flaws that could be easily addressed.","We wished for more on benefits, harms, and on context about the dose used in the study.   See our comments on those criteria below.

Of the 12 AML patients who received this experimental T-cell therapy after a transplant put their disease in remission, all are still in remission after a median follow-up of more than two years.\n\nGiving these cells when disease is in remission after transplant ""might actually be helping patients who have a high risk of relapsing to not relapse down the line,"" said Dr. Aude Chapuis, cancer physician and immunotherapy researcher at Fred Hutch, one of the study\'s leaders. Chapuis presented these results at the 2016 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in San Diego, California.\n\nThe findings in this group of trial participants contrast with the outcomes the researchers observed in a cohort of similar patients who received transplants around the same time but did not receive engineered T cells. In all of these transplant-only patients, the transplants produced remissions, but more than a quarter of them relapsed within just 10 months.\n\nIn the experimental T-cell therapy tested in this trial, certain T cells from each patient\'s transplant donor were genetically engineered to produce receptors that allowed the T cells to recognize, very specifically, a target molecule called WT1. WT1 is 10 to 1,000 times more common in leukemia cells than their noncancerous cousins, making it a natural target for therapies designed to destroy cancer cells while leaving most healthy cells alone.\n\nThis is the team\'s first trial of this strategy, which was initially developed in the lab of Dr. Phil Greenberg, one of the study\'s leaders and the head of Fred Hutch\'s Program in Immunology. Because it was the first study of this particular approach, the researchers focused on a high-risk group -- AML patients undergoing bone marrow transplant who had certain genetic or disease characteristics that decrease the chance of long-term transplant success -- ""a hard population of patients,"" Chapuis said, many of whom ""were horribly sick.""\n\nEach patient\'s therapy was created just for them in a specialized Fred Hutch facility. Certain T cells from each patient\'s matched donor were given the genetic instructions to make a receptor that specifically reacts to WT1. Then came a blood stem cell transplant: Patients\' leukemic bone marrow and blood cells were destroyed and replaced with healthy cells from their donors. A month later, when the team examined these 12 patients\' marrow, they found no trace of the cancers. Rapidly thereafter, once the transplanted cells fully engrafted, each patient then received up to 10 billion of the genetically engineered donor cells, infused into their arm through an IV.\n\nChapuis\'s role in this trial is on the laboratory side of the research, ensuring the quality of the genetically engineered cell products and monitoring the activity of the cells after infusion. She co-leads this research with Greenberg and Dr. Dan Egan of Fred Hutch, the trial\'s principal investigator and the care provider for trial participants. The study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health and spinoff Juno Therapeutics, of which Greenberg is a scientific co-founder.\n\nOutside of this trial, Chapuis treats cancer patients at Fred Hutch\'s clinical care partner, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Watching her patients undergo bone marrow transplant ? itself the first clear and reproducible example of cancer immunotherapy, developed at Fred Hutch ? has made her want to work toward something better.\n\n""That\'s my source of inspiration. I\'m always horrified by the intense treatment that we inflict on bone marrow transplant patients and the hardship that we make them go through. And I really think we can do better,"" Chapuis said. ""That\'s why I\'m doing this.""\n\n###\n\nAt Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch\'s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer with minimal side effects. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation\'s first and largest cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women\'s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Private contributions are essential for enabling Fred Hutch scientists to explore novel research opportunities that lead to important medical breakthroughs. For more information, visit fredhutch.org or follow Fred Hutch on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube.']","A discussion of surrogate endpoints (in this case, relapse rates) versus survival would have made this release more complete.","This release about a small trial of immunotherapy applied to a dozen leukemia patients who are at unusually high risk of relapse leaps to premature interpretations and inflates the meaning of the results far beyond the limited guidance for future research that this sort of study can offer.
It inappropriately elevates the importance of relapse rates, implying that they predict vital outcomes, such as survival or quality life improvements, which this trial did not measure. Even as it puffs up the potential benefits, the release neglects to note either the short-term harms reported by researchers in their scientific conference abstract or the potential life-threatening harms that immunotherapy may expose patients to. The release doesn’t provide context for how these trial results relate to  existing or other experimental treatments, and it makes makes only an oblique reference to the personal financial stakes of a lead researcher. It does not make any reference to cost, even though recently-approved immunotherapy treatments suggest the price tag could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
On the positive side, the release does a good job of explaining why adjuvant treatment to enhance the immune system after bone marrow transplant may be necessary in certain leukemia patients.

In healthy people, the muscles work in seamless coordination each step they take.\n\nWhen Bush or McGlynn walks, he pushes a button on an external controller, which sends signals to a pulse generator, which then sends electrical pulses to the electrodes. The pulses stimulate the nerves, which in turn stimulate the muscles in both of Bush\'s legs and McGlynn\'s left leg.\n\n""Both guys were taking steps the first time we turned the systems on,"" said Ron Triolo, a professor of orthopaedics and biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve and executive director of the Advanced Platform Technology (APT) Center. ""When Robert Bush took a step, it wasn\'t\' pretty, but we saw the potential.""\n\nIn each patient, ""the pulses are sent in a pattern that is close to how normal muscles work,"" said Rudi Kobetic, a principal investigator at the Stokes Cleveland VA and APT Center. ""We try to time the pattern to stimulation so that it\'s integrated with their ability. Similar to regular physical therapy, we can see results.""\n\nSignificant improvement\n\nBoth men gained strength and endurance through repeated use of the systems and fine-tuning by the researchers.\n\nBush went from the two steps to consistently walking more than 30 yards during the trial. In that time, he used a walker to help maintain his balance.\n\n""When they turned it on the first time, I was surprised how well it worked,"" said Bush, who had to give up his construction career due to the disease. ""I lifted my knee like I was high-stepping. Once we got it fine-tuned and I got walking, I thought it was amazing. I still think it\'s amazing.""\n\nMcGlynn\'s gait became noticeably more symmetrical and energetic, the researchers said. His gait without the system was about 19 yards per minute; with the system, 47 yards per minute. Training with the system improved McGlynn\'s speed when it was turned off to 23 yards per minute, indicating therapeutic benefit.\n\n""Distance is a challenge,"" he said. Initially, he could walk 83 yards but improved to 1,550 yards--nearly a mile--at the faster gait. ""I work up a good sweat and that makes me feel good,"" he said.\n\nDue to his improvements, the research team is developing a system that McGlynn can use at home and outside.\n\n""I\'ll be able to walk for exercise and hopefully be able to walk into church and into a restaurant,"" McGlynn said.\n\nWhen Bush\'s trial ended, surgeons removed his implanted electrodes. The researchers are seeking funding to fit him with a permanent FES system in a clinical trial.\n\nIn the meantime, Bush is now back to using a wheelchair but working to maintain his strength and flexibility, repeatedly standing and sitting while holding onto a rail or standing for long periods of time. ""I\'m keeping things ready for when they get the green light,"" he said.\n\n###\n\nOther researchers who contributed to the two studies are the APT Center\'s Lisa Lombardo, physical therapist; Kevin Foglyano, biomedical engineer; and Gilles Pinault, MD, a surgeon and co-director of the center.']","Short-term case studies of two patients, even very encouraging ones, don’t equal effective treatment for broad populations of patients, and the news release needed to spell that out.","Functional electrical stimulation illustration by Milos R Popovic – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=48016117
Just two patients — one with multiple sclerosis and one with paralysis from a stroke — participated in these studies on the feasibility of using implanted electrodes to restore the ability to walk.
Although it’s exciting so see assistive technology helping individuals, isolated short-term successes in a lab don’t equate to an effective treatment for broad populations of patients, but this news release from Case Western Reserve University doesn’t deliver that caution strongly enough. Nor does it discuss costs, offer comparisons with other treatment options, or explain potential risks with this technology, which was developed with the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The news release nicely describes how this technology affected these two patients, including videos showing them walking with and without the electronic stimulation.

For the first time, doctors say, new therapies that include the drug allow them to envision a time when they might be able to keep melanoma patients alive for years, treating the tumor as they would a chronic disease. Q&A: Learn more about this promising new drug The pill, known as PLX4032, doesn\'t cure melanoma, and it helps only the roughly 50% of melanoma patients whose tumors have a mutation in a key gene called BRAF. But among those patients in the study, 81% saw their tumors shrink. And for those 32 patients, the drug kept melanoma in check for a median of seven months, says the study\'s lead author, Keith Flaherty of Massachusetts General Hospital. No other drug has ever helped that high a percentage of patients with melanoma or any other solid tumor, says Paul Chapman, co-author of the study in today\'s New England Journal of Medicine. The results are especially striking, he says, considering that only 10% to 20% of patients respond to standard treatments for melanoma, which don\'t improve overall survival. ""This is the most important breakthrough in melanoma, ever,"" says Lynn Schuchter of the University of Pennsylvania, who worked on the study. Some patients improved within days, she says. The most common side effects are fatigue, rash and joint pain, but some patients also developed non-lethal skin cancers, the study says. Until recently, patients have had few treatment options. The last new treatment for advanced melanoma was approved 12 years ago, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation. In June, however, researchers published results of another experimental drug, ipilimumab, the first to prolong overall survival for advanced melanoma patients in a large-scale trial. And researchers already are developing several other drugs similar to PLX4032, Turnham says, which could be key to preventing relapses. Although cancer often can mutate to get around one roadblock, the disease might have a harder time overcoming two, three or four different obstacles. One day, Flaherty says, doctors hope to routinely test patients\' tumors for their genetic makeup, then prescribe a drug combination to keep melanoma under control for years. For now, the new drug ""gives us something that we\'ve never had before, which is to reverse the disease for a period of time and give people a respite,"" he says. ""But our goals are much loftier than that. We\'re not just aiming to buy patients nine months. We hope this marks the beginning of an era.""

Freedman of The Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa, the trial included 24 participants who were followed for up to 13 years. The $6.47 million trial was funded by the MS Society of Canada and its affiliated Multiple Sclerosis Scientific Research Foundation. The research was also supported by The Ottawa Hospital Foundation, The Ottawa Hospital Department of Medicine and Canadian Blood Services.\n\n""Our trial is the first to show the complete, long-term suppression of all inflammatory activity in people with MS,"" said Dr. Atkins, a stem cell transplant physician and scientist at The Ottawa Hospital, and associate professor at the University of Ottawa. ""This is very exciting. However, it is important to note that this therapy can have serious side effects and risks, and would only be appropriate for a small proportion of people with very active MS. People with MS who have had significant disability for a long time would likely not benefit.""\n\n""This procedure should be considered as a treatment option for people with early, aggressive MS,"" said Dr. Freedman, a neurologist and senior scientist at The Ottawa Hospital and professor at the University of Ottawa. ""Although this trial was relatively small, it was intensive, with the longest prospective follow-up of any such treatment group to date, and that is what makes the results so convincing. However, this is a very complex procedure that should only be performed at very specialized centres with expertise in both the management of MS patients and blood stem cell transplantation.""\n\nMS affects approximately 2.3 million people around the world, causing symptoms that range from blurred vision to extreme fatigue to partial or complete paralysis. It occurs when the immune system - which normally protects against foreign disease-causing organisms - mistakenly attacks the body\'s own central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. Early in the disease, people often experience temporary episodes of worsening symptoms accompanied by active inflammation in the brain (called relapses), whereas later on, disease progression is inevitable.\n\nThe trial evaluated a treatment called immunoablation and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (IAHSCT). The procedure begins by giving a person medication to coax their hematopoietic stem cells to migrate from their bone marrow into their blood. These stem cells are then collected from the blood, purified and frozen. Then, high doses of chemotherapy drugs are used to eliminate the person\'s diseased immune system. The stem cells are then transplanted back into the same person, so that they can give rise to a new immune system that has no ""memory"" of the previous pattern of attacking the central nervous system.\n\nThe trial included 24 participants with aggressive, relapsing MS. They were followed for anywhere between four and 13 years after treatment (with a median post-treatment follow up of 6.7 years).\n\nAfter the treatment:\n\nNot a single participant experienced a clinical relapse (zero relapses in 179 patient-years), whereas before treatment, the participants experienced an average of 1.2 relapses per year (167 relapses in 146 patient-years).\n\nNot a single new active inflammatory lesion could be detected in the brains of any of the participants (zero lesions on 327 MRI scans) whereas before the treatment, participants had 188 lesions on 48 scans.\n\nNot a single participant required MS-specific drugs to control their disease.\n\n70 percent of participants experienced a complete stop in disease progression.\n\nThe average rate of brain shrinkage, typically a measure that correlates with MS progression, returned to levels associated with normal aging.\n\n40 percent of participants experienced some lasting reversal of symptoms such as vision loss, muscle weakness and balance problems.']",Appropriately cautious release provides most of the right details on multiple sclerosis therapy advance.,"This is nearly a textbook example about how a news release can take mixed results from a clinical study and both highlight the promising findings while illuminating the harms and other issues, too.

In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects.\n\nTo Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D’s benefits is like a religion. “People want to have a simple story they can believe in,” he says.\n\nCedric Garland, meanwhile, hews just as strongly to the opposite view — that vitamin D supplements confer a slew of benefits, including warding off colon cancer, breast cancer, even Type 1 diabetes.\n\n“The science is, in my opinion, unassailable,” says Garland, an adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of California at San Diego. “It’s just preposterous to say it’s not proven.”\n\nIn January 2014, Autier published a statistical analysis of results from hundreds of studies of vitamin D. He concluded: “Unfortunately, there is probably no benefit to expect from vitamin D supplementation in normally healthy people.”\n\nGarland, on the other hand, is the co-author of dozens of studies showing a strong, inverse association between vitamin D levels and seemingly every disease under the sun. Indeed, sun exposure is Garland’s explanation for why rates of cancer, Type 1 diabetes and other diseases tend to be higher the farther people live from the equator. Vitamin D, after all, is the “sunshine vitamin,” synthesized from cholesterol in the skin in response to sunlight.\n\n“It’s a mathematical relationship,” he said in a telephone interview. “The higher your latitude and the greater your area’s average cloud cover, the higher your rates of cancer.” Since he and his late brother, Frank Garland, published the first study, in 1980, revealing that relationship, hundreds of other studies have explored the link between vitamin D, including supplements, and health — but none were large enough, long enough or designed well enough to convince the skeptics.\n\nNow three nationally recognized researchers are leading landmark studies designed to settle at least some of the questions about vitamin D once and for all. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public’s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves.\n\n“There’s been a rush to judgment on vitamin D,” says JoAnn E. Manson, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “Everyone has gotten on the bandwagon. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.”\n\nManson should know. She has led or collaborated on more than a dozen large, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, dating back more than two decades, which found none of the expected protection against cancer, heart disease, dementia or other diseases that scientists once attributed to beta carotene, vitamin E or vitamin C supplements. (She did find, however, that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 offered modest protection against age-related macular degeneration and, for those with a diet low in B vitamins to begin with, a hint of protection against the loss of cognitive abilities.)\n\nNow Manson is co-directing the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), testing whether, compared with placebo, a daily supplement of either 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D or one gram of fish oil (another widely touted substance) reduces the risk of stroke, cancer, heart disease and other health problems. The five-year study, involving 25,874 men and women, is scheduled to end in October 2017.\n\nAnother trial is testing whether a daily supplement of 4,000 IU of vitamin D will prevent Type 2 diabetes. The so-called D2d study, which will run for four years, is seeking to enroll 2,382 people older than 30 who are at high risk of developing diabetes due to weight or blood-sugar levels but who have not yet been diagnosed with the disease.\n\n“I would call myself an optimistic skeptic,” says Anastasios Pittas, principal investigator of the D2d study and a professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston. “The indirect evidence is very strong. People with higher levels of vitamin D in their blood have been shown again and again to have a lower risk of developing diabetes in the future. These studies are as consistent as we have ever seen with any nutrient.”\n\nBut, he adds, “those studies do not prove cause and effect. Before we make a blanket recommendation for the 86 million people in the United States who are at risk for Type 2 diabetes to go out and buy vitamin D supplements, we need to know for sure if they help.”\n\nA third trial, designed to test whether 5,000 IU of vitamin D per day will slow the progression of multiple sclerosis in 172 patients, is being led by Ellen Mowry, an associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n“I do discuss vitamin D with my patients,” Mowry says. “But I point out that we don’t yet have randomized, controlled-trials data to back it up. That’s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations. We have to be sure.”\n\nSo what are people to do in the meantime? Four years ago, Manson sat on a committee established by the Institute of Medicine to review how much vitamin D and calcium Americans need each day to maintain health and prevent disease. The report concluded that both are necessary for bone health but that as for preventing cancer, heart disease, diabetes and autoiummune disorders, the evidence was “inconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements.” Even so, the committee recommended that children and adults up to age 70 get 600 IU of vitamin D daily — from food and, if necessary, supplements — and that adults age 71 and older get 800 IU.\n\nSome studies have found no ill effects from taking far higher amounts, and many of the prospective but not proven benefits against cancer and other diseases are believed to require doses ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 IU. Manson urges people to rely on the Institute of Medicine report, which set a safe upper limit of 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day.\n\n“It’s fine to take that amount,” Manson said. “But keep in mind, there isn’t yet evidence that taking those higher amounts will confer any benefits beyond the recommended daily allotment of 600 to 800 IU.”\n\nSome studies, she noted, have even found evidence that very high levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood might be just as unhealthful as very low levels. A 2014 study, for instance, found that people with the highest levels of vitamin D in their blood (more than 60 nanograms per milliliter) were significantly more likely to die in the three months following a hospitalization as were people whose levels were between 30 and 49.9 ng/mL. Such findings are why she, Mowry and Pittas strongly advise people against taking more than the currently recommended upper daily limit of 4,000 IU, even though doses as high as 10,000 IU are available online and at many stores.\n\nFrustrated by the uncertainty? Pittas takes it in stride.\n\n“This is the beauty of medical research,” he says, “where you have some people convinced that vitamin D does nothing and others who believe it’s already proved to work. There is such controversy now that the only way to convince people who sit on those sides of the equation is to complete rigorous, randomized trials. We’ll see what happens. I have a hypothesis that vitamin D will work, but we have to test it. At the end of the studies, one of us will be right. I just don’t know which one.”\n\nHurley is a science journalist and author of “Natural Causes: Death, Lies and Politics in America’s Vitamin and Herbal Supplement Industry” (Broadway Books, 2007).']",A nice deep dive into existing research on vitamin D and the questions that some large new trials on the supplement are expected to resolve.,"This story examines the history of controversy over whether vitamin D has any preventive role in a laundry list of conditions including diabetes, depression and multiple sclerosis. There’s no controversy over its role in bone health. Different studies have reached different conclusions, and the story predicts that large randomized studies might help resolve these disputes a few years from now.
The coverage is exemplary in many ways. It delves deeply into the evidence on this topic and helps readers understand the strengths and limitations of existing studies. It features numerous expert perspectives from leaders in the field who provide a strong critical evaluation of the evidence. We were pleased to see the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) conclusions on vitamin D featured prominently. The IOM found that the evidence on vitamin D outside of bone health is “inconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements.”

Since then, clinicians and dermatologists have seen a rise in demand for minimally invasive laser-based treatments, including tattoo removal. However, it is difficult for the laser light, which is held at a distance from the skin, to be perfectly and selectively absorbed by only the targeted birthmark or tattoo. Now, researchers from the University of Missouri have developed instruments that transmit laser light into the tissue through direct contact. The techniques developed by the interdisciplinary team can be used by dermatologists and will reduce safety concerns in laser dermatology by improving laser transmission through surface layers of the skin.\n\nLaser techniques come with risks, including eye damage. Open-air transmission, in which the clinician holds the laser at a distance from the patient, is typical during normal dermatological procedures and presents a hazard to both the patients’ and doctors’ eyes. Paul J.D. Whiteside, a doctoral candidate in the MU Division of Food Systems and Bioengineering, devised a system that will not only improve the process, but will be safer for both clinicians and patients.\n\n“The system we developed uses ultrasonic pulsation in conjunction with a clinical laser to alter the properties of skin tissues during the procedure,” Whiteside said. “We’ve named the technique ‘sonoillumination,’ and we’re hopeful that the procedure will be available widely in the near future.”\n\nWhiteside and his team, including adviser, Heather K. Hunt, an assistant professor of bioengineering in the MU College of Engineering, tested the sonoillumination system on porcine skin tissue samples. Using various amplitudes and pulses, the instruments they developed were tested on the samples and showed great promise for the clinical setting. Whiteside presented his technique to clinicians on April 9, 2017, at the annual conference of American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS).\n\n“Pork skin samples are very close to human skin samples, so the initial results we saw are promising for human applications,” Hunt said. “‘Sonoillumination’ will be extremely beneficial for clinicians and the ASLMS presentation allowed us to demonstrate the system to the people who actually will be using the technology once it’s commercialized.”\n\nNicholas Golda, associate professor of dermatology and director of dermatology surgery at the MU School of Medicine, echoed the merits of the sonoillumination system and the effect it will have on dermatology.\n\n“Our goal is to provide patients with safer, more effective treatment options that potentially lower the number of treatments needed,” Golda said. “This new technology may also provide physicians with a safer, more controllable option for treating patients.”\n\nThe team co-authored the paper, “Ultrasonic modulation of tissue optical properties in ex vivo porcine skin to improve transmitted transdermal laser intensity,” which recently was accepted for publication by the society’s journal, Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. The sonoillumination research was funded in part by a 2015 Fast Track grant from the University of Missouri System.\n\nThe team is in the planning stages of developing a start-up company to commercialize the technique. Products produced by Whiteside and the team highlight the University’s impact on the state’s economic development efforts, including commercialization of research conducted at Mizzou, workforce development and job growth, quality of life improvements for residents, and attracting corporations and businesses to the state. Over the last five years, companies commercializing MU technologies have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and grants to advance their commercialization efforts. In 2016, the Office of Technology Management and Industry Relations reported that Mizzou received $14.9 million in revenue from more than 40 technology licenses.\n\nThe MU bioengineering department is jointly affiliated with College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR) and the College of Engineering.\n\nEditor’s Note: For more information on the patent application for sonoillumination, please see: https://www.google.com/patents/US20150351841']",Sensational terms like “revolutionized” are inapplicable when used to describe a new treatment that has yet to be tested on humans.,"This news release claims that a device being developed at the University of Missouri could revolutionize treatment to remove tattoos, birth marks and port-wine stains based only on a test on some pig skin…and that pig didn’t even have any tattoos or other markings.
The release quotes a researcher who hopes “the procedure will be available widely in the near future.” But there’s no evidence to support that statement either. While the release is peppered with claims that this device that combines laser light with ultrasound pulses will be safer and more effective, that’s not what the experiment tested. The researchers showed only that their device was able to push more laser light through a piece of pig skin than a conventional laser. Their assumption that increasing transmitted optical power will improve clinical effectiveness has yet to be tested. Neither benefits nor harms are put in numerical context. Alternatives are not mentioned. We applaud the release writers for including a link to a patent application, which provides more detail about the device and highlights potential benefits to the researchers. The release notes that the work was funded by a program to support commercialization of academic research.

Symptoms include weakness, muscle stiffness and difficulty thinking--a phenomenon often referred to as ""brain fog."" MS affects an estimated 2.5 million people worldwide, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.\n\nDamage to the thalamus, a structure in the middle of the brain that acts as a kind of information hub, and its connections with other parts of the brain play an important role in the cognitive dysfunction many MS patients experience.\n\nResearchers led by Laura De Giglio, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry at Sapienza University in Rome, recently studied the effects of a video game-based cognitive rehabilitation program on the thalamus in patients with MS. They used a collection of video games from the Nintendo Corporation, called Dr. Kawashima\'s Brain Training, which train the brain using puzzles, word memory and other mental challenges. The games are based on the work of Japanese neuroscientist Ryuta Kawashima, M.D.\n\nTwenty-four MS patients with cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to either take part in an eight-week, home-based rehabilitation program--consisting of 30-minute gaming sessions, five days per week--or be put on a wait list, serving as the control group. Patients were evaluated by cognitive tests and by 3-Tesla resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) at baseline and after the eight-week period. Functional imaging when the brain is in its resting state, or not focused on a particular task, provides important information on neural connectivity.\n\n""Functional MRI allows you to study which brain areas are simultaneously active and gives information on the participation of certain areas with specific brain circuits,"" Dr. De Giglio said. ""When we talk about increased connectivity, we mean that these circuits have been modified, increasing the extension of areas that work simultaneously.""\n\nAt follow-up, the 12 patients in the video-game group had significant increases in thalamic functional connectivity in brain areas corresponding to the posterior component of the default mode network, which is one of the most important brain networks involved in cognition. The results provide an example of the brain\'s plasticity, or ability to form new connections throughout life.\n\n""This increased connectivity reflects the fact that video gaming experience changed the mode of operation of certain brain structures,"" Dr. De Giglio said. ""This means that even a widespread and common use tool like video games can promote brain plasticity and can aid in cognitive rehabilitation for people with neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.""\n\nThe modifications in functional connectivity shown in the video game group after training corresponded to significant improvements in test scores assessing sustained attention and executive function, the higher-level cognitive skills that help organize our lives and regulate our behavior.\n\nThe results suggest that video-game-based brain training is an effective option to improve cognitive abilities of patients with MS.\n\nIn the future, the researchers hope to study whether the plasticity induced by video games in MS patients is also related to improvements in other aspects of their daily lives.

Now some medical centers are marketing their high-definitioncolonoscopes, which they say will detect more pre-cancerous polyps. Several recent studies have found a small benefit to high-definition colonoscopy over the standard variety, but gastroenterologists say physician technique is more important in detecting polyps than equipment.\n\nColonoscopy, a screening test doctors recommend for most people starting at age 50, allows doctors to remove pre-cancerous growths before they become full-blown cancer. The test involves inserting a thin, flexible tube into the rectum: An image of the inside of the colon is sent to a video screen.\n\nWhile the test saves many lives, scientists say, it is far from perfect and polyps are often missed. ""There is a growing consensus that we need to improve the overall quality of colonoscopies and high-definition is one of the technologies that may help us do that,"" says Michael B. Wallace, chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla. Dr. Wallace receives research funding from Olympus Corp., a manufacturer of HD scopes.\n\nTim Foley\n\nMany hospitals now use high-definition colonoscopes, which are sold by a number of companies. The image is sharper and more detailed, and could potentially help clinicians find polyps they would have otherwise missed. The HD scope made by Japan\'s Olympus, for example, shows 1080 horizontal lines of data on the screen, compared with 400 to 500 horizontal lines shown by a standard-definition scope, says Frank Filiciotto, executive director of technical marketing at Olympus Corp. of the Americas.\n\nLawrence Cohen, associate clinical professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, says switching to high-definition machines recently increased the detection rate of pre- cancerous growths called adenomas in his four-physician New York private practice to 50%, compared with 42% when using a standard-definition machine. Most of the increase involves small growths, or those with a flat shape that are hard to see.\n\nClinical trial results have been mixed. An 850-person study by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic found that HD colonoscopy did not improve the identification of individuals with either benign polyps or adenomas. The study was published online last August in the journal Digestive Diseases and Sciences.\n\nA 2,430-patient study by researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, published earlier this year in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, found adenomas in 28.8% of patients examined with high-definition colonoscopy, compared with 24.3% in those examined with standard colonoscopy. Polyps were found in 42.2% versus 37.8%. The scope tested, from Olympus, had both high-definition and a wide-angle view.\n\nThe combination of wide-angle and HD ""does increase polyp detection by a small but significant amount,"" says Dr. Wallace, senior author of the study. Most of the additional growths found were very small, he adds, and it\'s not known how many of them would actually become cancer.\n\nEventually, Dr. Wallace says, improved detection with HD and other technologies may allow for less frequent colonoscopy screenings—and maybe even a once-in-a-lifetime screen for people who don\'t have a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors. Currently, colonoscopies must be repeated every 10 years, or more often if polyps are found.\n\nHD colonoscopy doesn\'t currently cost patients or insurers more than standard-definition scoping. Over the long run, the more expensive equipment adds only a few dollars to the cost of performing each procedure, says Douglas K. Rex, director of endoscopy at Indiana University Hospital in Indianapolis, but the additional polyps found may result in more biopsies, raising costs. A number of technologies on the horizon—including blue light that improves visualization of blood vessels in polyps, may allow gastroenterologists to determine if polyps are pre-cancerous without sending them to the lab, he adds. Dr. Rex tests equipment for Olympus and is a paid consultant to the company.\n\nWhen planning a colonoscopy, patients should seek a doctor with good technique. Going slowly during the exam, washing the colon frequently and looking behind folds of skin is more important than the type of scope used, Dr. Wallace says. Ask your doctor what his or her adenoma detection rate is; doctors should be finding at least one adenoma in 25% of male patients and 15% of female patients, Dr. Wallace says.\n\nAn alternative to colonoscopy is flexible sigmoidoscopy, a shorter, less expensive exam which looks only at the bottom portion of the colon, combined with a fecal occult blood test, which looks for blood in the stool. This is a ""reasonable strategy"" for colon-cancer screening, but needs to be repeated at least every five years instead of once a decade, Dr. Wallace says.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com.']","A solid story that could have strayed into ""gee whiz"" territory. Instead, the writer places this new entry in the colonscopy device market — high definition cameras — into the proper context.","More outside sources, hard analysis of the data, use of absolute (not relative) data and better specifics about costs could have made the story even better.

The results of one new study may be less than hoped for, but the science is sound: The study concluded that injecting stem cells into the spinal cords of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe in most, though not all, cases. Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants.\n\nDr. Jonathan D. Glass, a professor of neurology and pathology at the Emory University School of Medicine and the director of the Emory ALS Center, specifically focused on human spinal cord-derived neural stem cells.\n\n""We put them into the spinal cord, and they came from a human spinal cord. The idea was that they would find a familiar and supportive environment,"" explained Glass.\n\nIn previous studies , Glass and his colleagues had transplanted such stem cells into the spinal cords of rodents with ALS and discovered that the treatment delayed the disease and improved survival.\n\nNext, in a study of 12 patients , Glass tested the safety of injecting the stem cells into the spinal cords of humans. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. Importantly, one patient showed some improvement, though he and his colleagues noted that this outcome ""must be interpreted with caution"" since the study wasn\'t designed to measure effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nFor the new study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, Glass and his colleagues tested increasing amounts of stem cells injected into 15 patients who were not enrolled in his previous study.\n\nWhat ALS does to the body\n\nWhen someone gets ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\'s disease, their motor network rapidly disintegrates. Nerve cells that communicate and control the voluntary muscles of the body (such as those in the arms, legs and face) degenerate or die. When communication between the brain and muscles ceases, the result is a gradual weakening and wasting away of muscles.\n\n""I always use the analogy of a house on fire,"" said Robert Goldstein, vice president of the ALS Therapy Development Institute . His nonprofit biotech research company has 25 therapeutic projects in progress, although none of them happens to be stem cell-based. ""The body is deteriorating rapidly.""\n\nJuanita Pharr, director of care for the Georgia Chapter of the ALS Association , has both personal and professional experience with ALS: A medical social worker, she also watched her father die from the disease.\n\n""My father was actually 69 when he was diagnosed. Someone can go for two years without being diagnosed properly, and that was the case with my father,"" Pharr said.\n\nNeither his primary care physician nor his neurologist could identify the cause of his deterioration. In fact, they first believed he had suffered a stroke. After all, ALS is rare, and in up to 90% of all cases, there is no family history and no known risk factors, as was the case with Pharr\'s father.\n\nALS affects men more often than women, usually between the ages of 40 and 70. Though more common between the ages of 60 and 69, this neurodegenerative disease can develop at any age, progressing rapidly. Most people with ALS die within three to five years after their symptoms begin, though about 10% survive for 10 years or longer. In Pharr\'s father\'s case, the progress of disease was rapid.\n\n""He did not want to go on the ventilator,"" she said, adding that many people prefer a ""natural death."" ALS often ends with respiratory failure since muscles in the diaphragm and chest walls eventually stop functioning. ""There\'s no cure, and we don\'t even have a treatment,"" she said.\n\nAccording to Goldstein, this isn\'t entirely a negative. ""One of the things ALS has going for it is, since it has no effective treatment or cure, you throw anything you can at it,"" he said. While for many other diseases, the researchers are focused on just one modality, ongoing ALS research uses each of the four key modes of medical treatment: small molecules, proteins and biologics, gene therapy and stem cells.\n\nWas this research necessary -- and ethical?\n\nThe ethics of human experimentation were thoroughly examined before the study began.\n\n""Ethical review happens at several levels: at the NIH, at the Food and Drug Administration and most importantly at University Institutional Review Boards at each institution where a faculty member is participating in a trial,"" Glass explained.\n\nIn Pharr\'s opinion, this and other stem cell studies are certainly fair from a participant\'s perspective, since beforehand, ""patients are presented with all the risk factors involved so they can make an informed decision."" Besides, she added, ""you automatically assume anyone with ALS can participate, but not everyone meets the criteria for a particular study.""\n\nThe results of the study: Most participants fared well. However, severe complications occurred in two of the patients as a result of the surgery involved. One developed partial paralysis, and another experienced ""incapacitating pain.""\n\n""People who do these studies should be considered medical heroes,"" Goldstein said, adding, ""The selflessness of these people when they\'re told they\'re gonna die.""\n\nSadly, disappointment is part of it, according to Pharr, who typically hears the frustration of people who go through a study that worked for another person but not for them. ""It may have had a different effect on someone else,"" she said. ""But that\'s why we don\'t have a treatment yet: because it doesn\'t work for everyone.""\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Stanley H. Appel and Dr. Carmel Armon wrote, ""These are clearly early stages of evaluating the risks and benefits of transplanting neural progenitor stem cells in patients with ALS.""\n\nThese early stages may be painful for some of the ""medical heroes"" involved, but the goal is clear: providing an effective and safe treatment for future patients who suffer from a devastating condition.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n""Importantly, people should understand that, at least for neurological diseases like ALS, we are just now getting started with testing our hypotheses about using stem cells as therapeutics,"" Glass said. ""We do not know if these treatments will work, and it will take time to test these therapies in a systematic and safe way.""']",This story is another example of an experimental stem cell therapy receiving news coverage while the research is still preliminary.,"A man with ALS participates in a fundraiser for research in New York City.
This story describes a small Phase 2 safety-focused trial of stem cell injections to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. The trial involving 15 patients tested whether the stem cell injections, previously performed in low doses at Emory University, would be safe in progressively larger doses administered at multiple medical centers. The study was published in the journal Neurology.
There isn’t much news here; the question remains open as to whether stem cells could be a safe and effective therapy for ALS. Nothing from these studies suggest that this treatment may slow or reverse progression of ALS. Given that, the story did a good job outlining the harms and risks from the procedure, and it included quotes from independent experts. But it is another example of how stem cell therapies get news coverage, even when the research is still preliminary.

Michael Cummings, told him to keep chewing the gum as long as it helped him stay off cigarettes. So 15 years after quitting smoking, Mr. Metzger, a 63-year old retired New York telephone worker, still chews 16 pieces of nicotine gum a day.\n\nPublic health officials are backing away from recommending against the long-term use of nicotine gum, lozenges and patches. The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to eliminate the 12-week warning and instead recommend nicotine-based quit-smoking aids for extended—perhaps even permanent—use. Anti-tobacco activists and GlaxoSmithKline PLC, the U.S.\'s leading marketer of nicotine-replacement therapy, or NRT, are also backing the potential move.\n\n""There really doesn\'t appear to be any great harm"" with long-term use of NRT, says Mr. Cummings, chair of the department of health behavior in the cancer-prevention division at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y.. ""You\'re better off chewing gum or wearing a patch than smoking.""\n\nBy giving former smokers the most addictive chemical in cigarettes—nicotine—NRT is designed to ease the difficulty of quitting. In more than a quarter century on the market, nicotine gum, lozenges and patches have amassed a strong safety record. Even among most long-term NRT users, the hazards of nicotine pale beside the dangers of smoking, which is the number one cause of lung cancer and the most preventable cause of cardiac death.\n\nNicotine itself is not believed by scientists to raise the risk of developing cancer. It may raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, however. It can elevate heart rate, constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure. Some people have adverse skin reactions to nicotine patches.\n\nLike other addictive substances, nicotine essentially hijacks the brain\'s reward system, conditioning users to associate intake with pleasure. But while other addictive drugs tend either to stimulate or relax users, nicotine can do both, depending on the user\'s mood, giving it a particularly tight grip.\n\nSudden withdrawal from the drug can induce intense cravings, nervousness, irritability, confusion and insomnia, among other symptoms.\n\nObtaining nicotine from gum, lozenge or patch doesn\'t replace entirely the pleasure of smoking any more than popping a tablet of caffeine—the addictive element in coffee—could equal the pleasure of a fresh-brewed cup of cappuccino. But jolts of nicotine can reduce the physical symptoms of withdrawal while quitters battle longings for the taste of tobacco, the sensation of smoke and various rituals that accompany the habit. (Going off NRT can also lead to withdrawal symptoms.)\n\nStudies, typically funded by NRT-manufacturers, have shown that those who use the products are about twice as likely to quit smoking after 12 weeks, compared to those who don\'t use NRT. But studies of those who successfully quit outside of NRT clinical trials often show no NRT advantage over the cold-turkey approach.\n\nAbout one in five American adults smokes—a rate that has remained virtually unchanged since 2004.\n\nNRT makers offer different dosages for heavy and light smokers, and recommend that the frequency of use decline over time, for instance, from a piece of gum every hour or two in the first six weeks of quitting to every four to eight hours in weeks 10 through 12.\n\nGlaxo products—which include Nicorette gum and lozenges and NicoDerm patches—account for more than half of the $835 million market in annual U.S. retail sales of over-the-counter smoking-cessation aids, according to market-research firm Euromonitor International. Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG also market NRT.\n\nThose skeptical of any move to eliminate warnings on long-term NRT use note that many public-health officials and anti-tobacco agencies have received funding from NRT\'s makers. ""There\'s no money to be made in cold turkey quitting, even though cold turkey is how the vast majority of former smokers kicked the habit,"" says John Polito, editor of WhyQuit, a popular blog that endorses cold-turkey cessation from tobacco.\n\nThe FDA has faced increasing pressure in recent years to loosen its rules on quit-smoking aids. Some public-health groups have filed petitions with the agency urging changes.\n\nAnother impetus is the landmark 2009 law signed by President Barack Obama that, for the first time, empowered the FDA to regulate tobacco products. The law, which is partly aimed at reducing smoking\'s toll on the nation\'s health, instructs the agency to consider rewriting the warnings on nicotine-replacement products, which range from eight to 12 weeks, depending on the type.\n\nThe warnings date back to when nicotine gum first received FDA approval back in 1984. They weren\'t based on hard science connecting health hazards to long-term nicotine addiction, but were set to mirror the length of use in clinical trials.\n\nBritain\'s Royal College of Physicians, which sets health standards in the U.K., concluded in a 2007 report on nicotine addiction that ""medicinal nicotine is a very safe drug"" and ""there are no grounds to suspect appreciable long-term adverse effects on health.""\n\nMany other countries have less-stringent policies on NRT. Canada, Germany, Japan and the U.K. have approved recommended-use periods of anywhere from six to 12 months.\n\nA few studies have examined the use of NRT beyond the current recommendations. Last year, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania published a study in Annals of Internal Medicine that found that smokers who use a nicotine patch for 24 weeks may be more likely to stay off cigarettes than those treated for eight weeks.\n\nHowever, the study reported no difference in the quit rates of the two groups when they were checked at the one-year mark, revealing the fact that many people began smoking again. The senior author of the study, funded by federal grants, has served as a consultant for GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nBarbara Gregg says that without nicotine gum she likely would have returned to smoking. Ms. Gregg, a 41-year-old executive assistant in the University of Minnesota\'s department of medicine, smoked for 22 years before she quit by going cold-turkey in 2007. She started chewing the gum about six months later, after experiencing nicotine cravings.\n\nIn 2009, before the start of her mother\'s funeral, she kept her father company as he smoked a cigarette in the parking lot.\n\n""I can guarantee you that if I didn\'t have nicotine gum with me, I absolutely would have bummed a cigarette off my dad and picked back up again,"" she says.\n\nWrite to David Kesmodel at david.kesmodel@wsj.com and Kevin Helliker at kevin.helliker@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This is a well written story that, with just a few additions, would have been a five-star story. Biggest need: a deeper exploration of the safety record for nicotine gum. </span>","The story explained in clear terms why nicotine gum is under scruitny right now and who is pushing for its expanded use. It listed many of the side effects of using the gum and explained nicotine addiction simply and elegantly.
We wish, though, that it had presented more of the hard data from some of the studies that receive only fleeting mention, that it had provided cost information and that it had done more to discuss alternatives to nicotine gum.
On the safety record for nicotine gum all we got in this story was one health behavior specialist saying, “There really doesn’t appear to be any great harm.” And a British regulatory proclamation that “there are no grounds to suspect appreciable long-term adverse effects.”  Statements like “doesn’t appear to be” and “no grounds to suspect” could be haunting some day. The story states that NRT products have “amassed a strong safety record” but we’re never given any details.
We also wish it had presented a more balanced perspective from the sources quoted. The two nicotine replacement users are probably not examples of how nicotine products are used widely. The use of nicotine replacement at high dose for 15 years is well outside any regulatory boundaries anywhere.

In 2012, Emily was the first child treated with an experimental immunotherapy that is on the verge of approval by the Food and Drug Administration. (Sean Simmers for The Washington Post)\n\nWhen doctors saw the report on Bill Ludwig’s bone-marrow biopsy, they thought it was a mistake and ordered the test repeated. But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans.\n\n“We were hoping for a little improvement,” remembered the 72-year-old retired New Jersey corrections officer, who had battled the disease for a decade. He and his oncologist both broke down when she delivered the good news in 2010. “Nobody was hoping for zero cancer.”\n\nThe pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Six-year-old Emily Whitehead, who was near death, became the first pediatric recipient in 2012. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free.\n\nSuch results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An FDA advisory committee will decide Wednesday whether to recommend approval of the approach, which uses patients’ own genetically altered immune cells to fight blood cancers.\n\nIf the panel gives the nod, the agency probably will follow suit by the end of September. That would open the latest chapter in immunotherapy — “a true living drug,” said Penn scientist Carl June, who led its development.\n\nEmily and her father, Tom Whitehead, have some ice cream alongside their dog, Lucy. Emily remains cancer-free five years after receiving CAR T-cell therapy. (Sean Simmers for The Washington Post)\n\nThe CAR T-cell treatment, manufactured by the drug company Novartis, initially would be available only for the small number of children and young adults whose leukemia does not respond to standard care. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. A year later, two-thirds remained so.\n\nAnd childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. Kite Pharma of Santa Monica, Calif., has applied for FDA approval to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and a similar Novartis application is close behind. Researchers also are exploring CAR T-cell therapy’s use for multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the disease that afflicted Ludwig. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge — using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example.\n\nThe excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. “We’re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit’s end trying to keep alive,” said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease — those who have exhausted all options — into remission.\n\nYet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure.\n\nIt involves extracting white blood cells called T cells — the foot soldiers of the immune system — from a patient’s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis’s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. There, a crippled HIV fragment is used to genetically modify the T cells so they can find and attack the cancer. The cells then are refrozen and sent back to be infused into the patient.\n\nOnce inside the person’s body, the T-cell army multiplies astronomically.\n\nNovartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion. Brad Loncar, whose investment fund focuses on companies that develop immunotherapy treatments, hopes the cost does not prompt a backlash. “CAR-T is not the EpiPen,” he said. “This is truly pushing the envelope and at the cutting edge of science.”\n\nThe biggest concerns, however, center on safety. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use.\n\n“Treating patients safely is the heart of the rollout,” said Stephan Grupp of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who as director of the hospital’s cancer immunotherapy program led early pediatric studies as well as Novartis’s global trial. “The efficacy takes care of itself, but safety takes a lot of attention.”\n\nOne of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. The other major worry is neurotoxicity, which can result in temporary confusion or potentially fatal brain swelling. Juno Therapeutics, a biotech firm in Seattle, shut down one of its CAR T-cell programs after five patients died of brain swelling. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said.\n\nTo try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others.\n\nGrupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy — and what to do about them — through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead.\n\nThe young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy.\n\n“I said, ‘Surely, this has been tried on kids somewhere else in the world,’ ” recalled her father, Thomas Whitehead of Philipsburg, Pa. “But Steve said, ‘Nope, some adults got it, but that was a different kind of leukemia.’ ”\n\nAfter she received the therapy, Emily’s fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital’s intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. Doctors decided to give Emily an immunosuppressant drug called tocilizumab.\n\nShe was dramatically better within hours. She woke up the next day, her seventh birthday. Tests showed her cancer was gone.\n\nThe approval of CAR T-cell therapy would represent the second big immunotherapy advance in less than a decade. In 2011, the FDA cleared the first agent in a new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. It has approved five more since then.\n\nThere are big differences between the two approaches. The checkpoint inhibitors are targeted at solid tumors, such as advanced melanoma and lung and bladder cancer, while CAR T-cell therapy has been aimed at blood disorders. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual. Many immunotherapy experts think the greatest progress against cancer will be achieved when researchers figure out how to combine the approaches.\n\nFor the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful.\n\nThe pair moved to Philadelphia in 1999 and dove into cancer research. Two years later, June’s wife died of ovarian cancer, something he has credited as spurring him to work even harder in the field. In the years that followed, researchers across the country, including at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, racked up an array of tantalizing discoveries involving T cells.\n\nFast-forward to 2010, when Ludwig, who lives in Bridgeton, N.J., became Penn’s first patient to receive CAR T-cell therapy. Two other men got the treatment not long after. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died.\n\nBut after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. To try to raise interest and funding, they decided to publish the results of their work. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a “firestorm,” June said — one that brought them new resources. David Porter, a Penn oncologist working with June, was on vacation in western Maryland and had to stop at a Kohl’s to buy a dress shirt for the immediate TV interviews.\n\nThe pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily.

In part, this is due to the cancer’s ability to resist anti-androgen therapy. A University of Colorado Cancer Center study published today [May 3] in Oncotarget shows that combining a CPT1A inhibitors with anti-androgen therapy increases the cancer’s sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide.\n\n“This is a huge development for men with CRPC that previously did not have many options,” says Isabel Schlaepfer, PhD, CU Cancer Center member, assistant professor in the Division of Medical Oncology and senior author of the study. “There is a critical need for improved therapies for this specific cancer type.”\n\nMost cells use the energy of glucose (sugar). Some prostate cancers evolve to use energy from lipids (fat). Previous work shows that metabolizing lipids helps prostate cancer escape anti-androgen therapy. However, there are many steps involved in lipid metabolism and researchers have been working to break prostate cancer’s ability to harness this energy source. In this study the researchers focused on the CPT1A enzyme. CPT1A helps facilitate the entry of long chain fatty acids into the cell’s mitochondria for oxidation. This oxidation is vital to lipid metabolism and has been shown to aid cancer cell survival, resistance to radiation, oxidative stress, and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways.\n\n“We had to find a way to block this pathway so that the cancer would not be able to burn lipid in the mitochondria to acquire energy to resist therapy,” explains Schlaepfer.\n\nIn fact, we are already able to block the action of the CPT1A enzyme. The drug ranolazine is a fat oxidation inhibitor that earned FDA approval in 2006 to treat angina. When Schlaepfer and colleagues experimented with fat burning inhibitors and anti-androgens in cancer cell lines, they found that the addition of ranolazine to anti-androgen therapy made tumors more sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide.\n\n“This finding may have a huge impact on patients with CRPC that had very few options before,” says Schlaepfer. “Since the drugs are clinically safe, a clinical trial can be designed in patients for whom enzalutamide is prescribed.”']",This release would have been greatly improved with a caution that pre-clinical animal research often doesn’t pan out in people.,"This news release on a study of a drug’s potential to help inhibit tumor growth in certain types of metastatic prostate cancer never informed readers that the study was done in mice and not men.
Maybe the best way to summarize this release is by parsing what the headline does and does not say: “Breakthrough Study Stops Fat-Eating Prostate Cancer Cells” may be literally true but completely and utterly misleading, lacking both evidence or relevance to real humans who may be suffering from castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) whose poor prognosis is due to their cancer’s ability to resist anti-androgen hormone therapy.
The study itself examines the use of CPT1A inhibitors and anti-androgen therapy which could increase a cancer’s sensitivity to enzalutamide in mice. But we think readers are left without even the most basic evidence to support the release’s claim that the study is a “huge development for men with CRPC that previously did not have many options.”

It finds that in the three years before widespread PSA testing (1983-1985), men getting their first diagnosis of prostate cancer were three times more likely to learn they had very late-stage cancer than men diagnosed in the most recent three years for which data is available (2006-2008).\n\n""By not using PSA tests in the vast majority of men, you have to accept you are going to increase very serious metastatic disease threefold,"" says study leader Edward Messing, MD, chief of urology at the University of Rochester Medical Center.\n\nIn 2008, about 8,000 U.S. men were diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. By projecting data from the pre-PSA era forward, Messing calculates that without routine PSA tests, 25,000 men would have been diagnosed in 2008 -- an extra 17,000 cases of deadly disease.\n\nBut it\'s not that simple, says Barnett Kramer, MD, MPH, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health. Studies looking back at cancer trends in a population are very unreliable when it comes to showing what caused those trends.\n\nFor example, Kramer says, what if a man got a PSA test when his prostate cancer was in the very earliest stages of metastatic disease? Microscopic cancers already have seeded his body. But he would not yet have symptoms or detectable metastatic disease, so he\'d be diagnosed with earlier-stage disease. He\'s subtracted forever from the men whose first diagnosis was late-stage disease, even though screening could not save his life.\n\nMessing says this misses the point of his study, which appears in the online July 30 issue of the journal Cancer.']",Better than ,"The story made an important attempt to evaluate the quality of the evidence, explaining that “studies looking back at cancer trends in a population are very unreliable when it comes to showing what caused those trends.” This doesn’t make up for some of the other gaps in the story  but it provides readers with invaluable information for helping them make a very important medical decision.

Several recent studies have shown that even a single dose in adults can lead to rapid reductions in depressive symptoms. However, relatively little research has been conducted into ketamine\'s antidepressant effects in adolescents.\n\n“Adolescence is a key time period for emergence of depression and represents an opportune and critical developmental window for intervention to prevent negative outcomes,” the authors wrote in the study.\n\n“Unfortunately, about 40% of adolescents do not respond to their first intervention and only half of non-responders respond to the second treatment,” they said. “Because standard interventions require prolonged periods (e.g., weeks to months) to assess efficacy, serial treatment failures allow illness progression, which in turn worsens the outcome. Hence, novel treatment strategies to address treatment-resistant depression in adolescents are urgently needed.”\n\nThe latest study involved thirteen young people aged between 12 and 18 years of age who had failed two previous trials of anti-depressants. Over two weeks the researchers gave them six ketamine infusions.\n\nThey found that the treatment was well tolerated, with the participants showing an average decrease in CDRS scores of 42.5%. Five of the participants met the criteria for clinical response and remission. Of these, three were still in remission after 6-weeks, while the remaining two relapsed within two weeks.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nAccording to the scientists, the results demonstrate the potential role for ketamine in treating adolescents with TRD. However, they note that the study was limited by its small sample size, so future research will be needed to confirm these results.\n\n""The field is excited about a potential new agent for adolescents with treatment resistant depression,” Harold S. Koplewicz, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology said in a statement. “We look forward to additional studies of ketamine to validate this treatment.”\n\nQuestions also remain regarding the long-term safety of ketamine as a depression treatment, so more information will be needed before broader clinical use.\n\niStock\n\nJames Stone, a Clinical Senior Lecturer from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King\'s College London, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek that there is ""a lot of potential for the use of ketamine as a second or third line antidepressant where other treatments have failed.""\n\n""Although ketamine is potentially a huge breakthrough in the treatment of depression, we still don’t know about the long-term safety, or about how to keep people well from depression without requiring regular ketamine dosing,"" Stone added. ""Further studies are needed to address these questions.""']",And potential harms weren’t spelled out — particularly important when it comes to the unknown effects of long-term use on developing brains and bodies.,"This story reported on a preliminary study looking at whether the drug ketamine might be a potential treatment for adolescent depression.  The story refrained from disease-mongering and quantified the scope of the observed benefits.
However, the headline and lead were misleading in stating that teens who took the drug had improvements in their depression. The word “promise” used in the headline wasn’t borne out by the data. In fact, the study wasn’t designed to offer reliable evidence that the drug offers a benefit. Caveats about the study were included only toward the end of the story, and readers were left in the dark about ketamine’s potential for misuse and its potential side effects. Costs were also missing.

A week later they were shown the colours again, accompanied by a loud sound but no shocks, and their fear responses were measured.*\n\nThe fear response was 60% lower in participants who had doxycycline in the first session compared to those who had the placebo, suggesting that the fear memory was significantly suppressed by the drug. Other cognitive measures including sensory memory and attention were not affected.\n\n""When we talk about reducing fear memory, we are not talking about deleting the memory of what actually happened,"" explains lead author Professor Dominik Bach (UCL Wellcome Centre for Neuroimaging, Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research and University of Zurich Division of Clinical Psychiatry Research). ""The participants may not forget that they received a shock when the screen was red, but they \'forget\' to be instinctively scared when they next see a red screen. Learning to fear threats is an important ability for any organism, helping us to avoid dangers such as predators. Over-prediction of threat, however, can cause tremendous suffering and distress in anxiety disorders such as PTSD.""\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a term for a broad range of psychological symptoms that can develop after someone experiences or witnesses a traumatic event. PTSD is caused by an overactive fear memory, and the new research shows that doxycycline can reduce the fear memory response in healthy volunteers.\n\n""We have demonstrated a proof-of-principle for an entirely new treatment strategy for PTSD,"" explains Professor Bach. ""The theory is based on the recent discovery that our brains need proteins outside nerve cells, called matrix enzymes, to form memories. Matrix enzymes are found throughout the body, and their over-activity is involved in certain immune diseases and cancers. To treat such diseases, we already have clinically approved drugs that block these enzymes, including the antibiotic doxycycline, so we wanted to see if they could help to prevent fear memories from forming in the brain. Our results support this theory, opening up an exciting avenue of research that might help us to find treatments for PTSD.\n\n""Using drugs to prevent PTSD would be challenging, since in the real world we don\'t know when a traumatic event is about to occur. However, there is growing evidence that people\'s memories and associations can be changed after the event when they experience or imagine similar situations. This is called \'reconsolidation\', and we now plan to test the effect of doxycycline on reconsolidation of fear memories. If this is successful, we would hope to apply the technique to more clinically realistic models of PTSD within a few years.""\n\nThe work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, University of Zurich and Wellcome.\n\n*In the first session, participants were given either doxycycline or a placebo and put in front of a computer. The screen would flash either blue or red, and one of the colours was associated with a 50% chance of receiving a painful electric shock. This happened 160 times, with the colours appearing in random order, so that participants learnt to associate the \'bad\' colour with the shock.\n\nA week later, under no medication, participants returned to repeat the experiment. This time there were no electric shocks, but a loud sound played after either colour was shown. Participants\' fear responses were measured by tracking their eye blinks, as this is an instinctive response to sudden threats. The fear memory response was calculated by subtracting the baseline startle response -- the response to the sound on the \'good\' colour - from the response to the sound when the \'bad\' colour was showing.\n\n###']",Bold claims abut this small and theoretical proof-of-concept study needed a lot more evidence.,"This University College London news release describes a complex piece of research that combines cell cultures, human volunteers, a theory that enzymatic proteins called matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors are involved in forming threat memories inherent in PTSD, and that a common antibiotic may prevent their formation by blocking the enzymes.
The fact that the research was a theoretical proof-of concept is buried deep in the release so readers might think, based on the headline and earlier paragraphs alone, that the evidence is stronger than it is.
The published research article describes some of the uncertainties involved in biopsychological investigations in animal models and people, but the release doesn’t mention any of them, nor does it include any meaningful numbers to describe the benefits. It does raise the issue of the practicality of using drugs to prevent PTSD since no one can predict when a traumatic event will occur.

This research shows that eating whole grains reduces the risk of heart disease,"" said John Kirwan, Ph.D., principal investigator and director of the Metabolic Translational Research Center, which is part of Cleveland Clinic\'s Endocrinology & Metabolism Institute.\n\nResearchers conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover trial. In the study, a group of 33 overweight and obese adults followed a whole grain diet (intervention) or a refined grain diet (control) for two eight-week periods. The diets were exactly the same, except for their content of whole grains or refined grains. At the beginning and end of each diet period, participants spent three days undergoing metabolic testing in a clinical research setting. Participants taking antihypertensive medication were instructed to maintain medication usage throughout the study.\n\nWhile on the whole grain diet, participants saw a three-fold improvement in diastolic blood pressure (the lowest pressure when your heart relaxes between beats) compared to the refined grain diet. This improvement equates to reducing the risk of death from heart disease by almost one-third, and the risk of death from a stroke by two-fifths.\n\n""The uniqueness of this study is that each of the 33 participants consumed both diets,"" said Kirwan. ""This level of control can only be performed for small numbers and provides the essential empirical data that cannot be obtained from large observational studies. These evidence-based data demonstrate the effect of diet on cardiovascular disease outcomes, particularly diastolic blood pressure.""\n\nBlood pressure is typically recorded as two numbers. Systolic is the top number that measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats. Diastolic is the bottom number, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle is resting between heartbeats.\n\nHypertension - or high blood pressure - is a common obesity-related condition that affects about 30 percent of U.S. adults and it is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Before age 50, an elevated diastolic blood pressure is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. As they age, people with elevated diastolic blood pressure are at a higher-than-average risk of developing elevated systolic blood pressure.\n\nOverall, there were substantial reductions in body weight, fat loss, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol during both diet periods, but these differences were due to the people changing their normal dietary habits to carefully controlled diets.\n\n###\n\nThis collaborative research began in 2010. It was supported by an investigator-initiated grant from Nestlé, NIH National Center for Research Resources Grant UL1RR024989, and NIH Grant T32 DK007319.

Located in Cleveland, Ohio, it was founded in 1921 by four renowned physicians with a vision of providing outstanding patient care based upon the principles of cooperation, compassion and innovation. Cleveland Clinic has pioneered many medical breakthroughs, including coronary artery bypass surgery and the first face transplant in the United States. U.S.News & World Report consistently names Cleveland Clinic as one of the nation\'s best hospitals in its annual ""America\'s Best Hospitals"" survey. Among Cleveland Clinic\'s 49,000 employees are more than 3,400 full-time salaried physicians and researchers and 14,000 nurses, representing 120 medical specialties and subspecialties. The Cleveland Clinic health system includes a 165-acre main campus near downtown Cleveland, nine community hospitals, more than 150 northern Ohio outpatient locations - including 18 full-service family health centers and three health and wellness centers -- and locations in Weston, Fla.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Toronto, Canada; Abu Dhabi, UAE; and London, England. In 2015, there were 6.6 million outpatient visits, 164,700 hospital admissions and 208,807 surgical cases throughout the Cleveland Clinic health system.

Each diet contained the same nutritional values but the whole grain diet consumers experienced a lowering of their diastolic blood pressure, which the researchers say lowers their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. But lowered blood pressure was a surrogate outcome, not a reduction in risk as the release claimed. It would take a larger outcomes study to determine if the diet reduced cardiovascular risk.

Don\'t take this to the bank.""\n\nLaRosa was referring to torcetrapib, which, like anacetrapib, belongs to the class of drugs known as cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors.\n\nA large trial on torcetrapib was killed after investigators found an increased risk of death and other cardiovascular outcomes.\n\n""I would be more excited [about anacetrapib] if I hadn\'t seen what happened to its cousin torcetrapib,"" Weintraub said. ""Torcetrapib raised HDL astoundingly but that was entirely neutralized by the increase in cardiovascular events.""\n\nIn the new trial, anacetrapib actually showed a tendency toward fewer cardiovascular problems and fewer angioplasty or bypass procedures, although the study only lasted 18 months.\n\nIt also didn\'t result in the blood pressure increases that helped doom torcetrapib.\n\nTo assess the safety of the trial, investigators randomly chose 1,623 adults with coronary heart disease who were taking cholesterol-lowering statins to receive either anacetrapib or a placebo for 18 months.\n\nAt the end of six months, LDL cholesterol was cut 81 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) of blood to 45 mg/dl, a reduction of about 40 percent. In the placebo group, LDL levels only declined from 82 mg/dl to 77 mg/dl.\n\nMeanwhile, HDL levels increased from 41 mg/dl of blood to 101 mg/dl in the treatment arm, versus a small jump from 40 mg/dl to 46 mg/dl in the placebo group.\n\n""We have 94 percent confidence that this drug doesn\'t have the harmful effect that torcetrapib had, but we didn\'t prove a reduction in events,"" said Brigham and Women\'s Cannon. ""That will be the subject of a larger study.""\n\nSuch a study is in the works, he added.\n\nDr. Neil Coplan, director of clinical cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, stressed that this was a ""safety trial, not a trial which is saying in any way that people should take these medications nor are the drugs approved.""\n\nStill, he added, ""the trial demonstrated safety and it demonstrated a tremendous effect on altering the lipid profile in a good direction. It\'s very promising but, as the authors note themselves, it\'s a first step.""\n\nExperts are still divided as to whether raising HDL levels will actually result in any meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes.\n\n""Currently, we\'re not convinced that manipulation of HDL matters, though certainly it\'s promising,"" said Weintraub, who added that results should be available relatively soon from other trials exploring the issue. ""The fact that LDL was also reduced also makes it promising.""\n\n""We\'ve never been able to satisfactorily demonstrate that raising HDL actually changes risk,"" added LaRosa.\n\nThe only drug currently available to raise HDL is nyacin.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Heart Association has more on understanding your cholesterol levels.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Better than CNN’s story on this same study, HealthDay <span style=""font-family: Arial;"">clearly framed the story around the safety concerns about this new class of drugs that are designed to alter how the body manages cholesterol and avoided promoting premature conclusions about potential health benefits. </span></span>","

The study reported outcomes in three groups of patients:  1) patients who underwent lumpectomy (surgery to remove the tumor) plus radiation versus lumpectomy alone; 2) patients who underwent lumpectomy without radiation versus mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast); and 3) patients who underwent lumpectomy plus radiation versus mastectomy.  Women who received radiation had a slightly lower (0.27% reduction) risk of death from breast cancer at 15 years compared to women with lumpectomy alone.
The release mentions some limitations of the research but missing is a broader discussion of the potential for over treatment of DCIS, whether DCIS needs to be treated at all, and whether women with low-risk forms of the disease can be safely monitored without treatment. We’ve written about this previously.

""Beta- blocker drugs compete with stress hormones and bind to the same target receptors [on a cellular level], but unlike stress hormones, do not activate cancer cells,"" said Dr. Des Powe, a senior healthcare research scientist at Queen\'s Medical Centre, Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust, in Nottingham, England.\n\nPowe is due to present the findings Friday at the annual European Breast Cancer Conference in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nPowe and his colleagues from the U.K. and Germany evaluated 466 cancer patients: 92 had received blood pressure-lowering medications and 43 of those 92, or nearly half, were on beta blockers at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThose on beta blockers had a substantial reduction in the formation of distant cancers, or metastases, and of local recurrence. They had a 71 percent reduced risk of death from breast cancer during the study compared to those who were either taking other blood pressure drugs or weren\'t on any blood pressure medications. Those on beta blockers also had a 57 percent reduced risk of getting a secondary cancer.\n\n""Our study was performed retrospectively, using patient notes [from women] that had received treatment in the late 1980s and 1990s,"" Powe said.\n\nOther experts called the results interesting, but preliminary. ""The concept of controlling tumor growth by preventing a stress or inflammatory response is not novel,"" said Dr. Cathie Chung, a medical oncologist and an assistant professor of oncology at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, Calif.\n\nFor instance, other research has found that women with breast cancer who regularly take aspirin, which is an anti-inflammatory, may have a decreased risk of recurrence.\n\n""I think this study is interesting, but very far from being conclusive,"" said Chung. It\'s not known, she said, whether there is a true association or whether it may be due to chance or another factor.\n\n""There is more work to be done before you can say whether this relationship is meaningful and will hold up,"" agreed Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nAs in other retrospective studies, he said, more research is needed to verify the potential link.\n\n""There are many other factors that come into play that could explain what happened,"" Lichtenfeld said. ""What if the women who take the beta blockers are more attuned to their health and they may be taking better care of themselves?""\n\nLike Chung, he agreed the proposed association is not far-fetched, just that more study is needed. Previous research, Lichtenfeld said, has found a reduced rate of skin cancer among men who take another type of blood pressure-lowering drug.\n\nPowe said he plans to do another study to validate the results.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about inflammation and cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']",A generally well done story that included ample caveats about this preliminary research. ,"This piece reports on preliminary results suggesting that there is an association between beta blockers and the decreased risk of dying from breast cancer or having a recurrence.

In order to explore the widely held belief that practicing yoga can relieve mental stress, the team reviewed more than 100 studies on the effect of yoga and mental health.\n\n“Most individuals already know that yoga produces some kind of a calming effect. Individually, people feel better after doing the physical exercise,” says lead study author Dr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, a professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke University Medical Center. “Mentally, people feel calmer, sharper, maybe more content. We thought it’s time to see if we could pull all [the literature] together … to see if there’s enough evidence that the benefits individual people notice can be used to help people with mental illness.”\n\n(MORE: Yoga Can Help Stroke Survivors Regain Their Balance)\n\nTheir findings suggest that yoga does in fact have positive effects on mild depression and sleep problems, and it improves the symptoms of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and ADHD among patients using medication.\n\nThe researchers focused on 16 studies that recorded the effects of practicing yoga on mental-health issues ranging from depression, schizophrenia, ADHD, sleep complaints and eating disorders to cognitive problems. They found positive effects of the mind-and-body practice for all conditions with the exception of eating disorders and cognition. Those studies involved too few participants or produced conflicting results to draw any meaningful conclusions.\n\nSome of the studies included in the analysis even suggested that yoga might affect the body in ways similar to antidepressants and psychotherapy. For instance, yoga may influence brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters (boosting levels of feel-good agents like serotonin), lower inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and produce a healthier balance of lipids and growth factors — just as other forms of exercise do.\n\n(MORE: We Tried This: Aerial Vinyasa (or Upside-Down) Yoga)\n\nEmbracing yoga as a complementary treatment for mental disorders is not uncommon. Yoga is a feature in many veterans’ centers throughout the country, backed by research funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Huffington Post reported that many troops use yoga as a form of treatment for PTSD, for example, with companies like Warriors at Ease training instructors in yoga techniques specifically catered to those in the military. A study published earlier this month of 70 active-duty troops found daily yoga eased anxiety and improved sleep.\n\nThe researchers say there’s enough evidence to warrant a larger study on the effects of yoga on mental health, and it should be considered as part of treatment for more disorders. “Many millions of Americans are doing yoga and many millions of Americans have mental illnesses and are popping psychiatric pills daily. Despite all of this, the vast majority of studies looking at the benefits of yoga are all small studies. We did not come across a single study where there was a coordinated effort done by some large agency to really conduct a large national study,” says Doraiswamy.\n\n(MORE: Does Yoga Really Drive People Wild with Desire?)\n\nBut while the research is promising, yoga likely won’t be a panacea for mental illness. Nor should patients try to replace their medications with the practice. “What we are saying is that we still need to do further, large-scale studies before we are ready to conclude that people with mental illnesses can turn to yoga as a first-line treatment,” says Doraiswamy. “We are not saying throw away your Prozac and turn to yoga. We’re saying it has the promise and potential. If a large national study were done, it could turn out that yoga is just as good and may be a low cost alternative to people with unmet needs.” In the meantime, he says it doesn’t hurt to add yoga to existing treatments so patients can take advantage of any potential benefits.']","This was a superficial report that passed along the main findings of a study, but not much else.","This story reports on a review of studies which found that yoga has “positive effects on mild depression and sleep problems, and it improves the symptoms of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and ADHD among patients using medication.” Unfortunately, that’s about all the story had to say about the review. If you want to know how much improvement yoga can produce, or what symptoms are most affected, or what type of yoga works best, you’re out of luck. Ditto if you’re looking for information on costs and harms, or if you were hoping for an independent take on the findings.The story did clearly call out some limitations of the included studies, but we wish it had mentioned some other critical caveats.

MD Anderson enrolled 18 patients who volunteered to provide both pre- and post-treatment tissue samples. The study revealed encouraging correlations between immunologic biomarkers and responses to treatment.\n\n""There have been no standardized treatment options for metastatic SCCA patients,"" said Van Morris, M.D., assistant professor of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology. ""This study demonstrated responses in five of 18 patients treated at MD Anderson, and many of the patients had significant reductions in their tumor size.""\n\n""In this first prospective phase II trial for refractory metastatic SCCA, our exploratory analysis of pre- and on-treatment tissues samples revealed potential correlations between immunologic biomarkers and clinical outcomes to nivolumab,"" said Cathy Eng, M.D., professor of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology and national study principal investigator.\n\nMetastatic SCCA, a cancer often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is normally treated with chemotherapy, although no trials have established a standard of care.\n\nThe study employed the monoclonal antibody nivolumab, one of the drugs represented among the growing arsenal of immunotherapy therapies. The drug frees the immune system to attack cancer by disrupting a brake that halts immune response.\n\n""This the first formal clinical trial completed with patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA,"" said Morris. ""In this trial, patients received a biopsy just before being treated with nivolumab and then a second paired biopsy after two doses.""\n\nStudy results showed a decrease in frequency of CD8 T-cells in post-treatment tumor samples among responder-patients. Immune monitoring of pre-treatment samples showed a significantly higher percentage of CD3 and CD8 T-cells as well as other indicators, all which point to correlations between immunologic biomarkers and responses to treatment. Five other markers did not demonstrate significant differences.\n\nOf note, patients who scored as responders had higher frequency of CD8 T-cells and PD-L1 CD45 immune cells in pre-treatment samples.\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded by MD Anderson\'s HPV Moon Shots Program and the HPV Anal Cancer Foundation, the E.B. Anal Cancer Fund, and a philanthropic donation. The Moon Shots Program aims to accelerate the conversion of scientific discoveries into clinical advances and significantly reduce cancer deaths.\n\nStudy team members for the correlative analysis included Armeen Mahvash, M.D., Interventional Radiology; Luis Vence, Ph.D., Jorge Blando, D.V.M., and James Allison, Ph.D., all of Immunology; Robert Wolff, Cancer Medicine; Aki Ohinata, GI Medical Oncology; Chimela Ohaji, Investigational Cancer Therapeutics; and Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., Genitourinary Medical Oncology.\n\nFinal clinical results for the study will be reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology\'s 2016 annual meeting in Chicago by Eng on behalf of the National Cancer Institute\'s Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) and its collaborators.']",This news release presents results of the study in a measured tone but doesn’t quantify in a clear way how this drug will benefit patients.,"As the nation’s largest cancer center, MD Anderson made a splash in 2012 with its ambitious announcement of a multi-billion dollar Moon Shots Program, which it called an unprecedented effort to rapidly convert scientific discoveries into life-saving advances. This news release, about a phase II clinical trial of the immunotherapy drug nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo) for one type of anal cancer, is decidedly more down to earth. The news release refrains from hype but still falls short of the mark when it comes to describing costs, potential harms, and comparisons with existing treatments. While calling results “encouraging,” the news release would be more helpful if it provided a meaningful assessment of whether this therapy might advance the Moon Shot’s directive of saving lives.

Twells, a clinical epidemiologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland. She bases this bold claim on her experience with seriously obese patients and a detailed analysis of the best studies yet done showing weight-loss surgery’s ability to reverse the often devastating effects of being extremely overweight on health and quality of life.\n\n“I haven’t come across a patient yet who wouldn’t recommend it,” Dr. Twells said in an interview. “Most say they wish they’d done it 10 years sooner.” She explained that the overwhelming majority of patients who undergo bariatric surgery have spent many years trying — and failing — to lose weight and keep it off. And the reason is not a lack of willpower.\n\n“These patients have lost hundreds of pounds over and over again,” Dr. Twells said. “The weight that it takes them one year to lose is typically back in two months,” often because a body with longstanding obesity defends itself against weight loss by drastically reducing its metabolic rate, an effect not seen after bariatric surgery, which permanently changes the contours of the digestive tract.\n\nIn reviewing studies that followed patients for five to 25 years after weight-loss surgery, Dr. Twells and colleagues found major long-lasting benefits to the patients’ health and quality of life. Matched with comparable patients who did not have surgery, those who did fared much better physically, emotionally and socially. They rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report problems with mobility, pain, daily activities, social interactions and feelings of depression and anxiety, among other factors that can compromise well-being.']","Benefits are discussed at length, but only in vague terms.","The story offers an overview of benefits associated with permanent bariatric surgery. It cites several studies, and includes links to all of them, and includes important information about the cost of surgery.

But three weeks later he was suicidal, checking into a mental hospital at his therapist’s urging.\n\nBy collecting the former editor’s DNA with a quick cheek swab, a new genetic test retailing at $3,800 would reveal which depression medications Brown would likely respond well to and those he would not.\n\nRUTLAND, Vt. — For the first time in John R. Brown’s two-decade quest for the right medication to make his brain behave, his psychiatrist offered him hope in the form of what seemed like rock-solid science.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I can’t help but wonder if I should have stuck with the devil I know,’’ Brown now says.\n\nGenetic tests to identify the most effective psychiatric drugs are the hot new technology in the race to create personalized treatments based on people’s DNA. More than 600,000 of these tests have likely been administered in the last three years, based on company websites and research data, to better treat conditions ranging from depression to attention deficit disorder to anxiety. In a nod to the tests’ growing acceptance, the federal Medicare program last year agreed for the first time to pay for the GeneSight test for some depressed patients.\n\nBut a review by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting has found that virtually all the evidence that these psychiatric tests work is based on limited studies funded by the companies themselves or researchers they fund, including all five studies used to promote GeneSight on the company’s website.\n\nThe federal government doesn’t require companies to prove that this and thousands of other tests are accurate before marketing and selling them. Unlike drugs, the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate them, though that may soon change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the testing firms’ research practices also raise questions about potential conflicts of interest. For example, California-based Proove Biosciences provides a full-time employee to administer and run a study on the company’s test at a Littleton, Mass., mental health clinic. It pays clinicians for time spent related to the study, a relationship that could give clinicians an incentive to steer patients to the test — and give the company access to insurance reimbursement for those patients.\n\nPatients also cannot find out for themselves if their doctor stands to gain financially by recommending a personalized medicine test. A public federal database created in 2014 to disclose financial relationships between the health care industry and physicians excludes most genetic tests.\n\n“It is the Wild West,’’ said Mildred Cho, associate director at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, who says there is little published evidence on the effectiveness of drug response tests.\n\nEric Lander, a leader of the Human Genome Project and founding director of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, goes further, saying in a New England Journal of Medicine article earlier this year that the mental health testing company claims are “not harmless and may be quite dangerous.”\n\nIn psychiatry, a field hampered by a lack of definitive tests for conditions and treatments alike, the idea of a genetic test to identify the drugs most likely to be effective is particularly appealing as a way to cut down on the trial-and-error approach to medications that many patients face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the tests do hold promise. The basic science behind them is built on years of solid research — analyzing an individual’s genetic make-up to determine how they may respond to drugs. GeneSight’s test was developed using technology from the respected Mayo Clinic and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.\n\nOfficials at Assurex Health, the Ohio-based company that makes GeneSight, stand behind their product. They make no guarantee that GeneSight will lead doctors to pick the right medicine for patients, but they point to company studies that show it more than doubles the odds they will. Plus, the officials note, the test underwent close review by a Medicare contractor before the agency agreed to pay for the tests.\n\n“Patients do better,’’ said Bryan M. Dechairo, senior vice president of medical affairs and clinical development for Assurex. “We continue to do more studies” to show the test’s value.\n\nThe amount of money at stake is enormous. Psychiatric conditions affect 1 in 4 adults every year and 1 in 5 teens, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Finding a test to more precisely target treatment could help troubled people find help more quickly, cut down on side effects, and save money. It can also make hundreds of millions of dollars for the test makers, which helps explain why at least 15 companies are now ramping up mental health testing.\n\n“It is so much more than just getting the medications right,’’ said Rachel Scott, vice president of clinical research and operations for Pennsylvania-based test maker Genomind. “It is giving patients the opportunity to step outside the stigma of mental illness, for them to see this is their biology — and give their clinician some objective information.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut psychiatric genetics remains in its infancy. Aggressive marketing and a lack of regulation of tests that have a thin scientific foundation have raised concerns for some bioethicists.\n\n“The claims of these companies are weak,’’ said Robert Klitzman, a psychiatrist and bioethicist at Columbia University in New York who had a commentary published last week in a mental health journal calling for vigilance in the marketing of genetic mental health tests.\n\n“Conflicts of interest in the field are major problems,” he said.\n\nPayments from test maker\n\nLast fall, the owners of the New England Center for Mental Health in Littleton, an adult and child clinic, were asked to be part of a research study.\n\nCalifornia-based Proove Biosciences wanted the center to join a national study, aimed in part at better understanding how its tests benefited adults with mental health conditions.\n\nThe company would provide the center with a full-time research assistant stationed in an office behind the reception desk. If a clinician and patient decided a Proove drug metabolism test, which analyzes 69 genetic variants, would be useful, the assistant would take the patient’s DNA with a cheek swab, collect insurance information for Proove to be reimbursed, and administer extensive questionnaires to track how the test worked out over time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We wanted to offer our patients a test that could really help them,’’ said Jessica X. Hennessey, director of operations and management at the Center for Mental Health.\n\nThe center received a one-time payment of $600 from Proove for training and is allowed to bill $150 for each hour of clinical research service and services rendered by Littleton staff members related to the study, according to Ernie Corrigan, a spokesman for the center. The Center for Mental Health has billed Proove a little more than $5,600 since then, Corrigan said.\n\nProove officials and Hennessey said clinicians are never compensated based on the type or number of tests they order, and clinicians do not promote the swab test in any way.\n\n“The tests are only ordered if they are medically necessary,” said Brian Meshkin, Proove’s founder and CEO.\n\nBut the close arrangement raises eyebrows among bioethicists because it can lead to the appearance of clinicians ordering the test to receive compensation for the study.\n\n“There is a big set of ethical concerns here,’’ said Columbia’s Klitzman, after being told about the Littleton study. He said those concerns are especially pronounced if doctors have financial incentives and “order tests that have no clear proven benefit.”\n\nFederal officials are growing increasingly concerned about such research-physician arrangements in the genetic testing field. Late last year, a large study that included psychiatric drug response by New Orleans-based Renaissance RX was shut down after Medicare halted payments and began a review. A Rhode Island doctor also sued the company, charging, in part, that Renaissance RX enrolled ineligible people in order to bill insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Office of the Inspector General for the US Department of Health and Human Services last year singled out compensation agreements related to research studies in a special fraud alert, noting there were growing cases of doctors receiving improper incentives regarding referrals.\n\nMedicare review\n\nThe GeneSight test has gotten the most outside scrutiny among the tests because it faced review by Medicare before the agency agreed to cover it for certain patients with depression.\n\nMedicare contractors were swayed by company-funded studies showing that when these patients took the medications recommended by the test, they had fewer symptoms after eight weeks compared with patients who did not use the test.\n\n“Use of the test to aid in [drug selection] has improved patient responses to treatment by 73 percent . . . these findings support the value of the GeneSight test,’’ according to the coverage decision.\n\nExcitement built in the mental health world that perhaps there was finally a scientific test that could help patients.\n\nBrown heard about the test from his psychiatrist, Susan Gerretson, of the Community Health Centers of the Rutland Region, and found out his federal insurance would pay for it.\n\nWhile his medications of lithium for bipolar disorder and the antidepressant Effexor were holding him steady, he was hardly in a happy place.\n\n“I figured, Why not try it?” he said.\n\n“I figured, Why not try it?” John R. Brown said. Caleb Kenna for The Boston Globe\n\nOf the five medications the test suggested he would respond best to, Brown had never tried two of them. After several months of discussion, Gerretson put him on one of those drugs, Fetzima.\n\nEven without the new drug, Brown says it was a challenging time: He turned 40, his old girlfriend called, and he quarreled with his mother.\n\nBut Fetzima “was a factor’’ in his breakdown, he believes. He paused during an interview this summer at the Brattleboro Retreat, a mental health treatment center, and gave a wry smile. “It sure didn’t help.”\n\nGerretson declined to talk specifically about Brown’s case, citing privacy concerns. But she said in an e-mail that she believes GeneSight can be helpful as long as a doctor fully understands a patient’s history and conducts his or her own research.\n\n“I never believe what sales representatives try to sell me,’’ she wrote.\n\nYet critics of these tests say it’s impossible for doctors — or anyone else — to truly evaluate many of the tests. GeneSight’s proprietary formula for interpreting genetic information has never been independently assessed. The test examines genes well-known to play a role in antidepressant response, but it adds others not suppported by the same level of evidence, some researchers say.\n\nRobert Howland, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, wrote a paper last year concluding that the makers of the GeneSight test have overstated the findings of their studies, making outside review more urgent.\n\n“Independent assessment . . . of the GeneSight test is necessary to overcome the appearance of bias,’’ said Howland.\n\nBut Assurex’s Dechairo said if the company didn’t do the research, no one would. The company has 12 ongoing studies not only for depression, he said, but for bipolar disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia and other medical issues.\n\nTo reach patients, the company markets its tests to the psychiatry world, in part by paying psychiatrists and nurses to talk favorably about their test to peers. The practice is not new in medicine, but, unlike the drug industry, most genetic test makers need not disclose which doctors they pay because they’re not FDA-regulated.\n\nCatherine Poulos, a psychiatric nurse practitioner at East End Mental Health in Hampton Bays, N.Y., advertises the GeneSight test on her website, saying it allows her practice “to use the right drug at the right dose.” But nowhere does it say on the site that she is paid to speak favorably to peers about the test; a patient would have to look at her Linkedin profile to see that. Poulos declined to speak on the record to NECIR.\n\nBut some consultants who use the tests say they do so because they believe in it, not because they get paid.\n\n“It adds clarity,’’ said Chris Bojrab, a psychiatrist and president of Indiana Health Group, a large behavioral health practice and a GeneSight consultant. He discloses his financial relationship with GeneSight on his website.\n\nAn FDA loophole\n\nThe FDA loophole that allows unregulated tests on the market dates back more than three decades to when the FDA began regulating diagnostic tests. At the time, the agency exempted what was then a small group of tests that were developed, manufactured, and used in a single lab, such as in a hospital.\n\nStarting in the mid-2000s, for-profit companies have used the exemption to develop thousands of complex genetic tests now in the marketplace without FDA review.\n\nThe FDA announced plans last year to regulate these tests over the next nine years. However, there is no timeline to finalize the rules, according to an FDA spokeswoman, and the process is likely to take years.\n\nCommercial labs and academic institutions are pushing back against regulation, arguing the rules will stifle innovation and delay life-saving tests getting to patients. Regardless of the outcome of the fight, many academic scientists say this new era in testing needs independent study. They question if the tests are adding unnecessary costs to health care.\n\n“These companies look at a very small subset of a very large number of factors’’ that go into treating patients, said Bruce Cohen, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and director of the program for neuropsychiatric research at McLean Hospital in Belmont. “People are making decisions based on unproven tests.”\n\nBrown’s decision was to go back to old medications. For him, the GeneSight test felt more like “a cool piece of science fiction” than a breakthrough. Still living in his mother’s house, he remains determined to rebuild his life.\n\n“I’m going to have to figure it out another way,” he said.']",This is a solid look at an emerging and important topic.,"This story, originally reported by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and published in partnership with the Boston Globe, describes the history and ethical implications of a loophole allowing genetic tests to bypass FDA approval before doctors prescribe them. Specifically, it outlines concerns regarding the use of genetic testing to help psychiatrists identify which drugs may work best for a patient with mental illness. The story evaluates the research that genetic testing companies use to demonstrate the effectiveness of their tests — and reports that most of these studies are funded or conducted by the companies themselves. The story makes clear that using these genetic tests to guide decisions on prescribing drugs poses risks for patients. The article overall is very well-researched and covers an emerging and important topic.

For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don’t have access to genetic tests at all.\n\nThat’s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient’s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.\n\nSome older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners — a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.\n\nMeanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.\n\nIt’s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics’ systemic blind spots.\n\nDiagnoses vs. probabilities\n\nThe algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They’re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.\n\nBut they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall “look” of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won’t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, “Does my patient have a genetic disorder?”\n\nThat’s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases — a means to an end.\n\n“We are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,” said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.\n\nDrawing that bright line between Face2Gene and “a diagnostic tool” allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.\n\nDiversity needed\n\nThe algorithm the NIH uses — developed by scientists at Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C., — seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.\n\nFace2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. “Since Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,” Gelbman cautioned.\n\nBut there’s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.\n\n“In every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,” Muenke said. “When I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren’t. There just aren’t.” (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH’s work.)\n\nSo diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn’t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. “We have thought about it but haven’t gone there yet,” Muenke said.\n\nFor example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges — as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome — the angles between landmark points on the child’s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children’s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other “typical” features weren’t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.\n\nIn fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. “One of the findings that I’m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,” Linguraru said.\n\nTo continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients’ faces — but that’s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH’s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.\n\nThose numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. “Most practitioners are located in North America and Europe,” Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn’t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.\n\nIt’s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH’s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 “skinny” budget proposal announced in March.)\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nFor now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm’s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAs both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients.""]","It’s also difficult to understand the “market” for this startup if most patients in the U.S. have access to genetic testing, which is needed for an actual diagnosis","This is a story that has a lot of good reporting, but by focusing on one company in the facial-recognition field, it leaves too many questions unanswered. The possibilities with facial recognition software are profound, and yet we don’t know from this story whether they truly could be used effectively for identifying and treating disease or whether they will be relegated mainly to sideshow status.

Several studies suggest a benefit to patients, but scientists say more large, rigorous studies are needed.\n\nCancer patients—due to the disease and to side effects of chemotherapy—often suffer from severe mental and physical fatigue, doctors say. Anxiety, nausea and pain are also common. In recent years, many cancer centers have been offering Reiki, a form of healing which originated in Japan in the early 1900s, according to scientific literature. In a session of Reiki, hands are placed lightly on the body. Each spot is treated for three minutes or longer and sometimes therapists place their hands just above the body without touching, says Donah Drewett, a Fairlee, Vt.-based Reiki therapist who works at Norris Cotton Cancer Center in Lebanon, N.H.\n\nExtra care is needed with cancer patients. Therapists must avoid sensitive areas on the body such as ports used to administer medications, doctors and therapists say. The gentleness of Reiki is appealing to cancer patients, many of whom are too ill to tolerate a deep-tissue massage, doctors say.\n\nReiki is often described as a treatment that helps life energy to flow in a patient—an explanation not generally accepted by scientists. Barrie Cassileth, chief of the Integrative Medicine Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, calls the energy theory ""absurd"" but says light-touch therapy can have a ""great relaxing effect"" on cancer patients ""who are constantly poked, prodded and given needles.""\n\nAdds Deborah Steele, manager of patient and family support services at Norris Cotton: ""How it works is a mystery, but we see anecdotally the amount of delight"" it brings patients.\n\nSome scientists think the benefits may be as simple as the warmth of human touch and the feeling that someone is caring for you. ""We do have a reciprocal effect between the mind and the body. if you relax one, you relax the other,"" Dr. Cassileth says.\n\nAt Memorial Sloan-Kettering, treatment for inpatients is available at no extra charge; outpatients pay $90 to $110 a session. At Norris Cotton, trained volunteers administer treatments free of charge—often while patients are at the hospital receiving intravenous chemotherapy treatments. Insurance typically doesn\'t pay for Reiki.\n\nOther centers don\'t offer Reiki, citing insufficient evidence. ""There isn\'t a good evidence base for its utility in cancer care as of yet,"" says Lorenzo Cohen, a professor in the departments of general oncology and behavioral science at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nDavid S. Rosenthal, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and medical director of the Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, co-authored a January study on Reiki that was published in Cancer. The study found twice-weekly, 50-minute sessions reduced anxiety in 18 men with prostate cancer, but the benefit wasn\'t statistically significant compared with a control group. A larger study is needed to determine if a benefit exists, Dr. Rosenthal says. ""The evidence for Reiki is still slim, but there are trends and we have to show whether those trends are real,"" he says.\n\nA 2004 study of 1,290 cancer patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering found a light-touch massage, standard Swedish massage and foot massage all helped symptoms including pain, depression anxiety, nausea and fatigue; the study didn\'t have a control group. In a 16-person study published in 2007 in Integrative Cancer Therapies, a team of Canadian scientists found five daily Reiki sessions of about 45 minutes improved quality of life and general well-being reported by cancer patients on a 28-question survey significantly more than resting for about the same period.\n\nStudy co-author Linda E. Carlson, a psychologist and an associate professor in the oncology division at the University of Calgary, says she thinks it is possible that a good rapport between the Reiki therapist and the patients could be the reason for the positive result.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com\n\nWrite to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The repeated statements about “benefit…healing…treatment…positive effect” in this column seemed to outweigh the statements about lack of evidence. </span>","We give the online version of this column credit for being merely descriptive in its headline: “Reiki used for cancer patients.” Yes. This method of light massage is indeed being used for cancer patients. But there isn’t much evidence to support it. The story tries to make this point clear, but the point is muddied by some of the more exuberant language in the piece. By referring to it as “a form of healing” and talking about how parts of the body are “treated” by “therapists,” the story legitimizes what is actually an uNPRoven form of massage that at times does not even involve contact between the massage therapist and the patient.

Based on 2010 U.S. Census data, a study estimated the prevalence of osteoporosis among women 50 to 69 years of age at 3.4 million. It has been estimated that the lifetime risk of osteoporotic fracture for a 60-year-old woman is 44 percent. Additional therapies are needed for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. As a result of its mechanism of action, it has been hypothesized that the drug abaloparatide, a synthetic peptide, would have a more pronounced anabolic (i.e., bone growing) action on bone compared with the osteoporosis drug teriparatide.\n\nPaul D. Miller, M.D., of the Colorado Center for Bone Research, Lakewood, Colo., and colleagues randomly assigned postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections for 18 months of placebo (n = 821); abaloparatide (n = 824); or teriparatide (n = 818). The trial was conducted at 28 sites in 10 countries.\n\nAmong 2,463 women (average age, 69 years), 1,901 completed the study. New vertebral fractures occurred less frequently in the active treatment groups vs placebo: in 0.58 percent (n = 4) of participants in the abaloparatide group; in 0.84 percent (n = 6) of participants in the teriparatide group; and in 4.22 percent (n = 30) of those in the placebo group. The estimated event rate for nonvertebral fracture was lower with abaloparatide vs placebo: 2.7 percent in the abaloparatide group; 3.3 percent in the teriparatide group; and 4.7 percent in the placebo group.\n\nBone mineral density (BMD) increases were greater with abaloparatide than placebo. Incidence of hypercalcemia (the presence of abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) was lower with abaloparatide (3.4 percent) vs teriparatide (6.4 percent). Overall, there were no differences in serious adverse events between the treatment groups.\n\n“Further research is needed to understand the clinical importance of risk difference, the risks and benefits of abaloparatide treatment, and the efficacy of abaloparatide vs other osteoporosis treatments,” the authors write.\n\n(doi:10.1001/jama.2016.11136; the study is available pre-embargo to the media at the For the Media website)\n\nEditor’s Note : This study was funded by Radius Health.

Shoback, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco, in an accompanying editorial.\n\n“The bar is high for any preventive treatment—in the efforts to prevent a fracture that may or may not ever occur, prescribers do not want to prescribe a therapy that causes a new problem.

But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.\n\n""The expectation in MS has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease. Now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability,"" said lead researcher Dr. Gavin Giovannoni. He is a neurology professor at Queen Mary University of London in England.\n\nThe treatment is not without its downsides, however. Because of the potential for side effects, people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, Giovannoni said.\n\nGiovannoni described Lemtrada as an immune system ""rebooter."" First, it depletes the immune system, then it allows it to recover, he explained.\n\nDuring the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said.\n\nAlso, when the immune system rebuilds itself, ""a significant number of people, about 40 percent, will develop another autoimmune disease,"" Giovannoni said. These include Graves\' disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which occurs in about 2 percent of patients, he noted.\n\n""But these diseases can be treated, so it\'s not like MS. It\'s kind of trading in your MS for another autoimmune disease,"" Giovannoni said.\n\nStill, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug.\n\nLemtrada is not for every patient with MS and the decision to use it should be carefully considered, said Dr. Dhanashri Miskin, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n""Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease,"" Miskin said.\n\nThe decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said. ""Although alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] treatment is associated with safety risks, those risks are manageable in most patients,"" Miskin said.\n\nThe new trial of more than 600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS was funded by Sanofi Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the drug\'s makers.\n\nMS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. People can suffer muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type, with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission.\n\nFor this study, Giovannoni and colleagues treated 628 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to at least one other MS drug. Lemtrada was given to 426 patients, while 202 received another drug, interferon beta-1a.\n\nThe researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years. By the study\'s end, nearly 28 percent of those given Lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a 10-point disability test, versus about 15 percent of those receiving interferon, the researchers found.\n\nMoreover, patients receiving Lemtrada were 2.5 times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon. And they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness, the findings showed.\n\nThe findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren\'t led by those recovering from relapses.\n\nGiovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from MS symptoms. Not only does alemtuzumab improve disability, but most patients go into long-term remission of at least five to eight years, he said.\n\n""Some patients have been going 12 years without any evidence of disease activity,"" he said.\n\nAccording to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, ""Restoring lost function is a significant unmet need for people living with MS.""\n\nThis study examines previous findings related to the reversal of some disability in those receiving alemtuzumab, he said. ""I am encouraged by these results and urge others to pursue potentially restorative approaches to treatment,"" Bebo said.\n\nGiovannoni pointed out that most of the drug\'s benefits are obtained early in the disease. ""If you really want this drug to have a big impact, you should use it as early as possible. In the European Union, it\'s recommended for early use,"" he noted.\n\nThe report was published online Oct. 12 in the journal Neurology.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about multiple sclerosis, visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.']",Readers need reminding that the manufacturer of a drug has an extremely strong interest in getting their drug used as early as possible in a disease process and that measures of “benefit” need to correspond to this early use.,"While most drugs are studied as a way to demonstrate benefit over other treatment, this trial of what could be described as a “last-ditch” drug–Lemtrada (alemtuzumab)–was studying optimal timing. Basically, is is better to give this drug more quickly, or only after trying other treatments?
This is a very important question and while this HealthDay story seems balanced, with numerous mentions of benefits and harms, there was a noted lack of a few key details, including the potential conflicts of interest among those who are pushing for quicker use of this treatment.

The first pregnancy from a frozen egg occurred in 1986.\n\nBut it’s been only in the past few years that fertility specialists have begun freezing eggs with any regularity — so short a time that two major professional groups, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, still consider egg freezing experimental. They caution that a request to freeze eggs should be considered by an institutional review board before being granted.\n\nFreezing eggs for non-medical reasons — a healthy woman choosing to harvest and preserve her eggs for conceiving a baby sometime in the future — is new enough that there are few reliable statistics on how successful the procedure is. “Success’’ in such cases means a take-home baby, not just an egg that is frozen without damage, or thawed safely, or even fertilized to yield a genetically normal, healthy embryo.\n\n“So few women who have frozen eggs have come back to use them [that it’s impossible] to quote a clear pregnancy rate on it,’’ says Dr. Elizabeth Ginsburg, medical director of assisted reproductive technologies at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. There hasn’t been time to collect enough data, since women usually plan to freeze eggs for many months or years before retrieving them for conception.\n\nBut the idea is clearly catching on. Nationwide, roughly half of 282 US fertility centers surveyed offer egg freezing, according to researchers at the University of Southern California, who conducted the study and published findings last month in Fertility and Sterility, a journal of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. There are about 400 fertility centers in the United States.\n\nEgg freezing, not usually covered by insurance, can cost $10,000 or more per procedure.

The new moms found that the conversations helped relieve symptoms.\n\n“Postpartum depression is a problem for one in seven women, and many of them don’t get help because there’s a stigma and they don’t have time and it’s expensive,” said study leader Dr. Nicole Letourneau, a professor and research chair in parent-infant mental health at the University of Calgary. “Training peer counselors to do phone counseling is an effective, low-cost and non-stigmatizing way for new moms to get the help they need.”\n\nParticularly for first-time mothers, postpartum depression can be hard to distinguish from the stress and fatigue that come with caring for a new infant around the clock, Letourneau said. Symptoms can include sadness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feelings of shame or guilt, as well as difficulty bonding with the baby or thoughts about harming the baby.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of phone counseling for easing these symptoms, Letourneau and colleagues identified 64 mothers with symptoms of major depression within 24 months after delivery and offered them up to 12 weekly peer support calls.\n\nThe average mom with depression was about 26 years old. Most had symptoms of depression before they got pregnant, and many had previously been treated with medication or professional counseling.\n\nThe women who volunteered as peer counselors attended an eight-hour training course and received reference materials about postpartum depression. They also had nurses available for phone consults if they had concerns about anything the moms said during their conversations.\n\nBy midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.\n\nOver the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. On average, they spoke about three times.\n\nMothers who left the study said they no longer needed support, sought counseling from mental health professionals, or didn’t have time for the phone calls.\n\nWhile all of the mothers were depressed at the start of the study, at mid-point only 32 percent were at risk for depression, and this declined to 15 percent at the end. Furthermore, at mid-point, 60 percent of the mothers had low depression scores; this percentage rose to 75 percent at end.\n\nEven though the small study had several women drop out and lacked a control group of moms who received different treatment, the results are consistent with previous research that has proven peer counseling works, said Dr. Ruta Nonacs, a psychiatrist at the Center for Women’s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\n“It is a very powerful experience to be able to talk to a woman who has gone through the same thing and come out the other side,” said Nonacs, who wasn’t involved in the study. “A lot of first-time moms wonder what’s normal, what’s depression, and what to do with the fact that they feel overwhelmed and alone and like their experience looks nothing like the happy moms they see smiling in all of the baby food and diaper commercials.”\n\nBecause postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbirth, it makes sense to explore peer counseling and other interventions that can reach women in rural or suburban areas where access to mental health professionals may be limited, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the Center for Women’s Mood Disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n“Most people in the world have access to a telephone,” said Meltzer-Brody, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1MPlxUu Journal of Advanced Nursing, online February 23, 2015.']",A generally complete report on a study of peer phone counseling for postpartum depression.,"This story reports on a small study suggesting that peer counseling by telephone can be helpful for some mothers experiencing postpartum depression. The story is thoroughly reported. It includes perspectives from two experts not affiliated with the research, and a good explanation of the study’s limitations. But there are a few areas where some extra details would have made the story stronger. For example, the story falls short in describing costs and potential harms of the intervention. We’d also add that in any study with no control group, it’s important to evaluate all aspects of the study that might explain the positive results. Did the women have any contact — for example, with other doctors or health professionals — that might have led to a reduction in symptoms? The story also could have done more to explain what happens to women with postpartum depression who aren’t treated. Would most of them get better with time? The study may not prove much if the women would be expected to get better on their own.

The results appear in the journal Cancer Research.\n\nOne difficult but crucial determination for surgeons and tissue pathologists is figuring out where a tumor ends. A solid tumor may be easily identifiable, but the tissue around the main body of the tumor, known as the margin, may contain cancerous cells as well. Because of this, excess tissue surrounding the tumor is typically removed, but the question lingers of whether any cancer cells remain to re-emerge later as tumors.\n\n""In almost all solid-tumor surgeries, there\'s a question of margins,"" said Dr. Boppart, who also is a medical doctor. ""Typically, surgeons will remove the tissue mass that contains the tumor and will send it to the lab. The pathologist will process, section and stain the tissue, then examine the thin sections on microscope slides. They look at the structure of the cells and other features of the tissue. The diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted. This is what we call the gold standard for diagnosis.""\n\nThe new device is a hand-held probe based on a technology called optical coherence tomography (OCT) that uses light to image tissue in real time. Cancer cells and normal tissue scatter light differently because they have different microstructural and molecular features, Boppart said, so OCT gives physicians a way to quantitatively measure the cellular feature of a tumor. Surgeons can pass the OCT wand over a section of tissue and see a video on a screen, with no special chemical stains or lengthy tissue processing required.\n\n""In many cases, you can\'t tell the difference between cancer cells and normal tissue with the naked eye, but with OCT they\'re very different,"" said Boppart, who also is affiliated with the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the U. of I.\n\nIn the clinical study, surgeons treated patients according to the standard surgical procedure, but OCT data were collected from the margin of the tumor cavity and the margin of the removed tissue mass during surgery so that the results could be compared later. The study found that the OCT device analysis identified the differences between normal and cancerous tissue with 92 percent sensitivity and 92 percent specificity. They also found that the way that OCT spotted cancer in the removed tissue was closely correlated with the results from the postoperative pathology reports, which often came days later.\n\n""For the first time, this study demonstrates the use of OCT for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity, in the patient, during surgery,"" Boppart said. ""It is likely better to check to see if any residual tumor cells might be left behind, rather than checking the tissue mass that was taken out. Then, the surgeon can intervene immediately.""\n\nThe researchers will continue clinical studies with the OCT device, looking at other types of solid-state tumors. Diagnostic Photonics, a start-up company Boppart co-founded that also collaborated on the study, is commercializing the OCT probe technology for broader use.\n\n""Ultimately, new technological innovations like this in medicine and surgery are going to improve our health care and save lives. That\'s when this work will be most rewarding,"" Boppart said.\n\n###\n\nThe National Institutes of Health supported this work.\n\nEditor\'s notes: Editor\'s note: To reach Stephen Boppart, call 217-244-7479; email: boppart@illinois.edu.']",Pretty good account of an early study about a new device. Addition of cost and potential harms would have completed the picture for readers.,"The experimental light probe. Credit University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
This news release describes the results of a small clinical “proof of concept” trial designed to blind-test the reliability and accuracy (i.e. sensitivity and specificity) of a hand-held light-only probe that surgeons might use to accurately determine how much tissue beyond a visible tumor should be removed during cancer surgery to help contain the disease. The release does a praiseworthy job of pointing out right away that the goal of the study was to measure the performance of the instrument, called an optical coherence tomography (OCT) device, against the “gold standard” practice of surgically collecting tissue from both the tumor and the “margins” around the tumor cavity, and sending both to a pathology lab for definitive diagnosis and evidence  that surgeons “got it all.” The release would have benefited from more information about the sensitivity and specificity of the results among the patient groups. And it didn’t describe what it is, exactly, that OCT identifies — i.e. the mixed and disorganized microscopic tissue structures that are the markers of malignancy. But overall, the release does make clear the potential of the technology without over-promising a timetable for clinical use. And it does an admirable job of disclosing the financial interest in commercialization of the device by one of the investigators. Readers will be mostly well informed by this release.

Nocturnal hot flashes are among the most problematic because they can contribute to poor sleep.\n\nA new study shows that electro-acupuncture may be effective in providing some relief. The study is being published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).\n\nCompared with women who undergo natural menopause, women with breast cancer are at a greater risk of experiencing hot flashes, partially as a result of the premature menopause that results from chemotherapy and surgery, as well as estrogen deficiency caused by the use of breast cancer treatments such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. It is estimated that by the year 2020 there will be nearly six million breast cancer survivors in the United States.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from a randomized, controlled trial involving 58 breast cancer survivors experiencing bothersome hot flashes. They compared the benefits of using electro-acupuncture (the application of a pulsating electric current) to prescribing gabapentin, an anti-seizure medication frequently prescribed to treat sleep disturbances related to hot flashes. The study showed electro-acupuncture to be comparable to, if not better than, gabapentin in helping to reduce hot flash severity and frequency and improving overall sleep quality (including falling asleep faster and fewer sleep disruptions). Although it is not exactly understood how acupuncture affects sleep, it has been shown to affect a number of neurotransmitters associated with sleep, such as serotonin and melatonin.\n\nPoor sleep is particularly bothersome for breast cancer survivors experiencing nighttime hot flashes because it has been shown to increase levels of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Although electro-acupuncture produced significant sleep improvements, researchers noted that sleep quality for the participants was still not as good as it should be, implying that more research is necessary to explore possible combinations of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.\n\n""This study shows that, for women who need or choose to avoid medications, electro-acupuncture may be an option because it has minimal risks, but blinded controlled trials are needed,"" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, NAMS executive director.\n\n###\n\nFunding for the study was provided in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Cancer Center.']","The release is absent of useful details savvy readers look for when analyzing an intervention such as demonstrated benefit, cost, harms, and sponsors.","This short release reports on a small study looking at whether electro-acupuncture is effective in diminishing night-time hot flashes among breast cancer survivors, and therefore, improving the quality of their sleep.  While it states that this therapeutic approach is as good as, or perhaps better, than a drug (gabapentin) often prescribed for hot flashes, the release offers no data showing the extent of improvement, nor are there mentions of the cost of such treatments, or of potential harms from using it which, while not enormous, are not negligible either.  The release also neglects to identify any of the researchers involved in the trial.

Surgery, radiation, or some combination of both may lead to miserable side effects such incontinence, impotence and rectal damage. Doctors usually can’t predict whether a man will suffer all or none of those side effects. While some risk factors are well-known -- including age, diabetes and poor cardiovascular health -- whether a man suffers harsh side-effects is often chalked up to random luck.\n\nSo what if it were possible to know before treatment which men might be more likely to suffer complications?\n\nNew research, published Thursday in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, discovered a set of genetic markers that appear to indicate a significantly greater risk of collateral damage from radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Knowing a man’s susceptibility to fallout from radiation may steer a doctor toward surgery instead of other potentially damaging therapy.\n\n“More often than not, it’s not clear-cut which way to go,” explained Barry Rosenstein, professor of radiation oncology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. “If you see a surgeon, he’s likely to say surgery is best. If you see a radiation oncologist he’ll say oncology.”\n\nDetermining what type of treatment a man should receive is only part of the dilemma of prostate cancer. The debate whether to even test for it is ongoing. This early-stage study represents a big step toward doctors and their patients making that decision.\n\nThe researchers started with a pool of 841 men treated with radiation for prostate cancer. Patients were assessed every three to six months for signs of sexual dysfunction for up to five years. The number of men studied was eventually winnowed down to 260 patients with erectile dysfunction and 205 controls.\n\nThe scientists then performed DNA analyses on the men, looking for genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced snips), slight differences in the “spelling” of our DNA. After sifting through hundreds of thousands of SNPs, they settled on 12 suspect genetic variations.\n\nIt turned out that when the SNPs were combined to create a score that could be used to measure individual risk of treatment complications, having just one of the 12 SNPs more than doubled the risk. The more of the 12 a man had, the greater his chances of radiation therapy complications.\n\n“It is cumulative,” Rosenstein explained. “If a man has five or six, it increases his chances quite a bit.”\n\nThe research is still in the early stages, so doctors aren’t likely to be using the genetic markers to determine treatment any time soon. “This is still not nearly good enough, yet” he said.\n\nBut he’s part of an international consortium that is trying to make that very scenario a practical reality. The next step, he said, is for group members to validate the predictive power of the markers his team found.\n\nIf they can, then doctors really will be “able to assign patients to treatments and see if we maintain the same level of control of cancer and lower the incidence of complications,” he said. “And if we can do that, then there’ll be enough confidence to put it into use in the clinic.”\n\nEven better, he suggested, it may one day be possible to use drugs to target the SNiPs, or the biological processes they influence, as a way to prevent damage from therapy.\n\nThat hope is evident to other researchers, such as Dr. Ithaar Derweesh, a urologic oncologist and associate professor of surgery at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center.\n\n""This is a study that in certain ways is groundbreaking and also elegantly performed,"" Derweesh said.\n\nWhile Derweesh agreed with Rosenstein that such a technique will take time to validate, and be used to steer patients toward a particular therapy -- something he called the ""holy grail"" -- he suggested that in the nearer term, such markers might be used as a trigger to pre-emptively begin erectile rehabilitation or to take measures that might lessen the potential damage.\n\nThis kind of work is important not just for prostate cancer, but all cancers. While there has been greater success in treating cancer, survivors may live many years with side effects after treatment. If Rosenstein’s hopes are fulfilled, it may one day be possible to prevent some of the damage before it’s done, and still effectively treat the cancer.\n\nBrian Alexander (www.BrianRAlexander.com) is co-author, with Larry Young Ph.D., of ""The Chemistry Between Us: Love, Sex and the Science of Attraction,"" (www.TheChemistryBetweenUs.com), now on sale.\n\nRelated:']","This story, based on a paper in a radiation oncology journal, never tells readers whether the radiation treatment that followed the test in question helped the men in the study in terms of cancer control.  Big picture missing.","The story reports on interesting and important research, but the story gets satisfactory scores on less than half of our criteria.

Proof that they help is not.,"['And that duck on a plane? It might be an emotional-support animal prescribed by a mental health professional.\n\nThe trend, which has accelerated hugely since its initial stirrings a few decades ago, is underpinned by a widespread belief that interaction with animals can reduce distress — whether it happens over brief caresses at the airport or in long-term relationships at home. Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. But the popular embrace of pets as furry therapists is causing growing discomfort among some researchers in the field, who say it has raced far ahead of scientific evidence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year in the Journal of Applied Developmental Science, an introduction to a series of articles on “animal-assisted intervention” said research into its efficacy “remains in its infancy.” A recent literature review by Molly Crossman, a Yale University doctoral candidate who recently wrapped up one study involving an 8-year-old dog named Pardner, cited a “murky body of evidence” that sometimes has shown positive short-term effects, often found no effect and occasionally identified higher rates of distress.\n\nOverall, Crossman wrote, animals seem to be helpful in a “small-to-medium” way, but it’s unclear whether the critters deserve the credit or something else is at play.\n\n“It’s a field that has been sort of carried forward by the convictions of practitioners” who have seen patients’ mental health improve after working with or adopting animals, said James Serpell, director of the Center for the Interaction of Animals and Society at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “That kind of thing has almost driven the field, and the research is playing catch-up. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn’t enough.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUsing animals in mental health settings is nothing new. In the 17th century, a Quaker-run retreat in England encouraged mentally ill patients to interact with animals on its grounds. Sigmund Freud often included one of his dogs in psychoanalysis sessions. Yet the subject did not become a research target until the American child psychologist Boris Levinson began writing in the 1960s about the positive effect his dog Jingles had on patients.\n\nBut the evidence to date is problematic, according to Crossman’s review and others before it. Most studies had small sample sizes, she wrote, and an “alarming number” did not control for other possible reasons for a changed stress level, such as interaction with the animal’s human handler. Studies also tend to generalize across animals, she noted: If participants are measurably soothed by one golden retriever, that doesn’t mean another dog — or another species — will evoke the same response.\n\nEven so, media headlines are often about the happiness bounce. Hal Herzog, a Western Carolina University psychologist who has long studied human-animal interactions, recalls a 2015 study on the health benefits for children of having a pet dog. “Here’s a reason to get a puppy,” NBC announced. “Kids with pets have less anxiety.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat’s actually not what the study concluded. The authors did find that children with dogs had lower anxiety based on screening scores than children without dogs. Still, they cautioned that “this study does not answer whether pet dogs have direct effects on children’s mental health or whether other factors associated with acquisition of a pet dog benefit their mental health.”\n\nIt was a classic case of conflating correlation and causation, which Herzog says is common. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). The pet-industry backed organization funds research on the topic.\n\n“The number of papers I see that start out, ‘It is now well-established that there are health benefits from owning pets’ — that drives me crazy,” Herzog said. “Yes, there’s literature that supports that. But there’s also literature that doesn’t find that.”\n\nHABRI Executive Director Steven Feldman takes a more positive view of the science while acknowledging that more research needs to be done. “Just like getting vegetables and getting exercise, I would say having animals in our lives is also an essential element of human wellness,” he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo many animal lovers and pet owners, the back-and-forth might sound horribly wonky. There’s something intuitive about the good feelings animals give us. Why over-analyze it?\n\nAlan Beck does not disagree. Beck, who directs the Center of the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, cites one common theory for why animals might be therapeutic. It’s called the biophilia hypothesis, and it argues that humans evolved a built-in need to affiliate with other living beings.\n\n“Throughout history, animals gave us some comfort. So if it works for you and me in a relatively normal environment, maybe it has a special role for someone who has a depression and stress disorder — that just makes sense,” he said. “The literature does show it’s not bad. And that’s just as important.”\n\nFocusing too much on scientific support sometimes feels like a form of “physics envy,” Beck added, “where you try to quantify everything without appreciating it.”\n\nBut there are good reasons for rigorous research on animals and mental health. In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it would not cover costs of service dogs for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, citing “a lack of evidence to support a finding of mental health service dog efficacy.” The department is now in the midst of a multiyear study on the topic, which could lead to government funding for these pooches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnother reason, the scientists say, is for the animals’ sake. Crossman pointed to a 2014 incident at Washington University in St. Louis as an example of animal therapy gone wrong. A bear cub brought to campus during finals week nipped some students, causing a rabies scare that almost ended with the animal being euthanized. More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier “is not a harmless distortion. … If the public believes that getting an animal is going to be good for them, many times an unsuitable person will get an unsuitable animal, and it doesn’t work out well for either.”\n\nThe research is getting stronger, in part because funding is growing — from HABRI as well as from a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health and the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition. Crossman’s recent study at the Yale Innovative Interactions Lab was among the work being supported.\n\nIt relied not just on the Labrador retriever Pardner but seven other certified therapy dogs. Several times a month over much of the past year, they hung out at the university for 15-minute sessions with children who had just finished two stressful tasks: spontaneously crafting stories and telling them to strangers, followed by doing math problems.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe strangers were the researchers, and their mission was to assess whether the kids, ages 10 to 13, would find their time with the dogs to be therapeutic. The study was designed to avoid some of the pitfalls that Crossman has seen elsewhere, which is why some of the 78 young participants got to play only with a fuzzy blanket — because tactile stimulation is known to reduce stress — and why others simply waited for the 15 minutes.\n\n“Without the controls, the changes could be due to all kinds of things, like the fact that lots of time has passed,” Crossman said. “Kids are actually pretty good at coping.”\n\nThe children completed questionnaires to assess their mood and anxiety before and after; spit samples, to measure the “stress hormone” cortisol, were taken at three points. At the end, all the kids got a “junior scientist” certificate, lots of praise and an open play session with the dogs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCrossman, who emphasizes that she is an animal lover, declined to reveal the findings before they’re published. But “hopefully” they will show that dogs can affect children’s stress, she said — before quickly offering a researcher’s clarification.\n\n“I say ‘hopefully’ not just because I think it works or hope it does, but because these programs are used so widely,” she explained. “Kids are already participating in this on a huge scale. Ideally, the order goes the other way around: We test the idea, and then we implement.”\n\nRead more:\n\nAD']",The story effectively conveys the lack of scientific consensus regarding how effective therapy animals are at reducing stress.,"The story focuses on the lack of evidence supporting the fundamental concept of “therapy animals” — that interacting with animals can reduce stress or distress in humans.
The story includes input from an array of expert sources and offers a broad (if vague) overview of the research literature regarding therapy animals. There are some shortcomings here — for example, not much was said about the costs of pet therapy.
However, in sum, the story effectively conveys the lack of scientific consensus regarding how effective therapy animals are at reducing stress.

Specifically, they aren’t getting enough DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), an omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega 3-LCPUFA) that's critical to a baby's brain development. DHA is primarily obtained by eating fish and other seafood.\n\nFor the study, researchers from Canada's University of Alberta studied 600 women during and after pregnancy to monitor their intake of omega 3-LCPUFAs. These include DHA, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid). DHA is believed to be the biggest player in neurological health and is the primary structural fat found in the brain.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association recommends that healthy adults, including pregnant and lactating women, get at least 500 milligrams per day of omega 3-LCPUFAs. Meanwhile, the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids advises that pregnant and lactating women consume at least 200 mg of DHA per day.\n\nThe researchers found that only 27 percent of women during pregnancy and 25 percent of women three-months postpartum were meeting those DHA recommendations.\n\nThe Power of DHA\n\n“Omega 3s are needed for the infant’s brain and nervous system to develop properly,” says contributing study author Catherine Field, a registered dietitian and professor of nutrition at the University of Alberta. “Also, the membranes of every cell in a person’s body contain omega-3 fatty acids. They are needed for the cell to grow and function.” After all, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, babies are doing at lot of growing.\n\nWhat’s more, during pregnancy omega-3 fatty acids are required for mom’s body to produce more red blood cells so that she can provide enough nutrients and oxygen to her growing baby. These fatty acids also help the placenta grow and function as needed, Field says. It’s this placenta that omega-3 fatty acids including DHA diffuse across to reach the baby and spur brain development, says Dr. Vincenzo Berghella, past president of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine as well as professor and director of the division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.\n\nNot surprisingly, low intake of DHA in moms is linked to babies with lower cognitive development (often associated with crying and poor sleep) as well as lower IQs and attention deficit disorders, Field says. What’s more, her previous research in both animals and humans shows that DHA intake during breastfeeding impacts infants’ immune system development, which may explain why babies who receive low amounts of DHA through breast milk have an increased risk of asthma and allergies. She also notes that DHA supplementation may help prevent preterm labor, preeclampsia and postpartum depression.\n\nHowever, whether DHA benefits more than babies' brain health isn't conclusive. “Data from observational studies and from randomized controlled trials suggest that omega-3 during pregnancy could be associated with several benefits such as lower risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia and other obstetrics complications. However, there are contradicting results,” Berghella says.\n\nIn fact, Berghella’s 2015 review of 34 randomized controlled trials found that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with decreases in risk. However, the review did find that women with single-child pregnancies (no multiples) had a 73 percent lower risk of stillbirth or early infant death if they began supplementation by 20 weeks into their pregnancies.\n\nHow to Get More DHA\n\nSushi’s one thing, but during pregnancy, you shouldn’t lay off seafood entirely, Berghella says. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant and breastfeeding women eat at least two servings of fish or shellfish (about 8 to 12 ounces) every week. But take care to choose low-mercury options such as shrimp, salmon and catfish. The group recommends avoiding shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, and limiting white tuna consumption to 6 ounces per week.\n\nHitting those recommendations will get you approximately 1,400 mg of DHA per week, Berghella says. (While that’s not exactly 200 mg per day, if you average your intake out over the course of a 7-day week, you still hit recommended amounts.) In the University of Alberta study, seafood, fish and seaweed products contributed to 79 percent of women’s omega 3-LCPUFA intakes from food. The biggest source: salmon. Good thing, as a 2007 study published in The Lancet found that children born to mothers who reported no seafood intake had the greatest risk of behavioral problems and poor scores on early developmental and IQ tests.\n\nIf you don’t eat seafood, DHA supplements can help, says Dr. Gabriele Saccone of the University of Naples Federico II’s department of neuroscience and Berghella’s collaborator. But if you do take supplements, opt for fish-oil varieties, since DHA from fish may be more beneficial than getting it from vegetarian supplements, according to Saccone. And no worries, they are low in mercury.\n\nEven if you are eating some seafood – just not quite two servings per week – a fish-oil supplement could still help. In the current study, women who took a supplement were 11 times more likely to get 200 mg of DHA per week during pregnancy and lactation compared to those who went supplement-free. Apart from taking supplements, Field also recommends eating foods enriched with DHA, such as milk and eggs.\n\nWondering about avocados, walnuts and olive oil? While they are all filled with omega-3 fatty acids, they aren’t of the DHA variety. These plant sources of omega-3s contain ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which, while good for you, has a hard time converting into DHA so that it can really benefit baby’s brain development, Berghella says. In North Americans and Europeans, only about 4 percent of all ALA consumed becomes EPA or DHA, Field says.""]",This story embraces a study’s finding that “women aren’t getting enough” omega-3s during pregnancy. We thought the story could have provided more context with that message.,"This story had some useful information. It does a nice job explaining what omega-3 fatty acids are and how they are related to development in babies. It also gives an overview of general recommendations for omega-3 intake and fish consumption during pregnancy. But we were hoping for more critical interpretation of the new study which is the news hook for the story. And while it does mention a study that critically examines some claims about omega-3s in pregnancy, the story also drops a litany of scary-sounding conditions — lower IQs, attention deficit disorders, asthma and allergies, preterm labor, preeclampsia, postpartum depression, stillbirth, early infant death! — that are supposedly linked to insufficient omega-3 intake. We think the cumulative effect of this barrage is more likely to frighten than inform.

story_reviews_00744,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/new-method-for-hip-replacement-wins-favor-with-some-surgeons/,2013-03-25 04:00:00,New method for hip replacement wins favor with some surgeons,"['Correction: A previous version of this story had an incorrect spelling of physical therapist Patrick Kennelly’s name and an incorrect location for his practice. This version has been updated.\n\nHip replacement involves removing the joint — the damaged bone and cartilage — and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal, plastic or ceramics. In a break from past practice, some surgeons prefer to cut into the joint from the front. (ANTHONY UNGER/ANTHONY UNGER)\n\nOver the past two decades, the number of Americans having total hip replacements has more than doubled, to more than 300,000 a year. Though most patients eventually walk again without pain or the aid of a cane, recovery and rehabilitation can be rigorous, painful and lengthy.\n\nThe surgery is extensive: As its name suggests, it involves removing the joint — the damaged bone and cartilage — and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal, plastic or ceramics. Typically, surgeons enter the joint from the rear, which requires cutting through muscle and cartilage. But with a relatively new procedure, surgeons enter from the front and only stretch the muscles aside, avoiding the cutting and minimizing pain and recovery time. According to those who use this anterior technique, the benefits are substantial.\n\nAnthony Unger, medical director at the Institute of Bone and Joint Health at Sibley Memorial Hospital and a clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at George Washington University Hospital, says the anterior approach is “truly minimally invasive.” Unger, who has done about 4,000 hip replacements over 26 years and has used the anterior technique for the past eight years, says “patients have better overall functionality, can sleep on their sides and be confident the new hip won’t dislocate.”\n\nBut, as with many transitions in medical techniques, some surgeons have been reluctant to change. Although agencies and hospitals don’t track hip replacements by the type of procedure used, Unger says that, based on statistics from the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, only 20 percent of its members choose the anterior approach.\n\nJoshua Jacobs, a vice president of the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons and chairman of orthopedic surgery at Rush University in Chicago, says the AAOS doesn’t “endorse or promote one specific technique or procedure over another.” Jacobs prefers the posterior approach, which he says has been reliable for him.\n\nHe says that while he’s heard about the benefits of the anterior approach, he’s “not aware of a randomized, controlled trial comparing the posterior and anterior approach that shows a definite superiority of one over the other.” What’s key is that “surgeons need to do the approach they’re most comfortable with to get the best outcomes.”\n\nTeetering ‘like Chaplin’\n\nA study by Unger in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery in 2011 found that with the anterior procedure, there was less muscle damage and inflammation both in the immediate postoperative period and two days later than with the posterior approach.\n\nOthers surgeons who prefer the anterior procedure say it preserves more of the normal anatomy, which also means fewer medications and shorter hospital stays. Michael Bollinger, who operates at Palm Drive Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif., switched methods a few years ago.\n\nWith the anterior approach, Bollinger says, “we can take\n\nX-rays during the operation, to see if the new hip is placed correctly and adjust it, when necessary.” Many surgeons use a special operating table that makes this possible.\n\nAlthough surgeons can also take X-rays during the posterior procedure, it is much more difficult, and they wait until patients are in the recovery room, where, Bollinger says, “there’s not much that can be done.” He explains that while the body “tolerates an imperfect alignment pretty well, if a new hip gets dislocated, it’s often because it’s not in perfectly.”\n\nThe anterior approach offers other benefits.\n\nRobert Saunders, a nurse at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif., sees about 200 hip replacement patients a year. He says that “nurses love the anterior approach” because there’s less worry about dislocating the joint. “With the posterior approach, we have to spread patients’ legs apart and strap them to a pillow to keep the new joint in place. If they want to move or roll over, they can’t,” he says.\n\nSaunders says the anterior patients also have an easier time with physical therapy, which can start the same day as the surgery. “Those who’ve had the posterior procedure have a lot of pain, since, when they sit up, they’re right on top the incision,” he explains.\n\nPatrick Kennelly, a physical therapist with Smartherapy in Chevy Chase, says people who have the anterior procedure “don’t feel so weak, because their hip muscles haven’t been cut. If they’ve had the posterior procedure, even if they don’t consciously feel weak, they tend to shift their weight onto one foot and teeter like [Charlie] Chaplin.”\n\nCautious surgeons\n\nGiven benefits such as these, why haven’t more surgeons switched methods? Unger says that most surgeons have used the posterior approach for years, have fine results, and see no need to switch. Also, he says, they work in a “very high-stress, high-liability environment. For this reason, new techniques are adapted slowly with extreme care, and in some cases, not at all.”\n\nUnger adds that surgeons are naturally cautious and typically wait to see results from many studies before they switch methods. Besides his study, there have only been a few others. One, a prospective, randomized study by William Barrett, an orthopedic surgeon in the Seattle area, compared the two approaches in a peer-reviewed paper he presented at the 2012 annual AAOS meeting and found benefits with the anterior approach.\n\nAnother obstacle to the widespread use of the newer approach is that if established surgeons want to switch, they face time and cost constraints. They must get training in classes and cadaver labs, and the learning curve can be steep. Unger says his was relatively short — about 20 cases. Others say it took about 50 cases.\n\nAnd this creates economic issues. “If you’re a busy surgeon, you have a volume to maintain,” Bollinger says, “and it’s hard to go from doing three a day to one during the learning period.”\n\nChristopher Chen, a surgeon who uses the anterior approach at Alta Bates Summit, adds that most doctors “still use the posterior approach because it’s the one they were taught.” And, he says, the majority of younger surgeons learn the older approach because established surgeons are typically the ones who staff the residency training programs and demonstrate the method they know best.\n\nMost surgeons don’t profit from choosing one approach over another, Chen says. “If there is a financial incentive” for promoting the newer technique, he says, “it is that more patients will want the anterior approach, so that the surgeon does more surgeries, and therefore collects more professional fees for that.”\n\nWilliam Hamilton, who operates at the Anderson Orthopaedic Clinic at Inova Mt. Vernon Hospital, trains young surgeons to do the anterior approach in a year-long hip and knee replacement fellowship program. Hamilton says that “during this time, they’re taught both approaches.” But he adds that “since 2009, of the 13 fellows he trained, 12 use the anterior procedure as their primary approach in their practices.”\n\nHamilton says that “a decade ago, very few residencies and fellowships taught the anterior approach. Now, several institutions around the country have at least one surgeon teaching it. So when students leave and begin their practices, it’s no longer foreign to them.”\n\nHamilton, who has performed 1,100 anterior procedures and strongly supports the method, says that despite growing interest, “it will take a generation of new surgeons” before use of the anterior approach is widespread.\n\nPatients aren’t informed\n\nMany patients aren’t aware of the option. The case of Daniel Ellsberg — who in 1971 released the Pentagon Papers, a secret study about U.S. involvement in Vietnam — is instructive. His hip had been hurting for about a year, and when he decided to have surgery, his primary-care physician recommended a respected surgeon. Just days before the operation last July, a friend told him about the anterior approach.\n\n“I’d never heard of it, and neither my doctor nor surgeon mentioned it. I called the surgeon’s office, learned he did the posterior procedure, asked for and got a recommendation for one who performs the anterior one, and my experience was amazing. The same day as the operation, I walked down the hall with a walker. I was home in three days, and a week later, [I] walked one or two blocks without pain or a cane. In a month, I bodysurfed at the beach,” says Ellsberg, who is 81 .\n\nMargot Machol, who is two decades younger and lives in Washington, had both hips replaced — the first with the posterior procedure several years ago, the second with the anterior procedure last October. Unger performed both surgeries.\n\n“After the first, I needed pain medicine when I came home from the hospital. Also, I had a long list of restrictions of what I could and couldn’t do so the hip wouldn’t pop out. For six weeks, I had to sleep on my back, couldn’t cross my legs and wasn’t able to drive.\n\n“After the second, I didn’t take any pain pills once I was home, slept on my side soon after the surgery, had almost no rules and drove my car in two weeks. I even wanted to ski over Christmas, because I felt fine,” Machol says.\n\nKoeppel is a writer based in Washington.']","The story feels like a conversation among a lot of very smart people explaining hip surgery in a very compelling way, so compelling that you might miss the lack of evidence for the new method being touted in this story.","The descriptions in this story are well crafted, and the attempt to bring in a variety of voices about hip replacement should be commended. Ultimately, though, we were left with a big question mark about why this method of surgery was being promoted at this time. A careful reader might note that the headline could be applied to nearly any new  medical technique. “New method for hip replacement wins favor with some surgeons” could easily be “new method for tummy tucks wins favor with some surgeons” or “new method for prostate removal wins favor with some surgeons.” There always will be “some surgeons” who favor one technique over another. That doesn’t make the technique worth promoting for free in a prestigious newspaper.

This cancer trap can be used for early diagnosis and treatment of metastasized cancer.\n\n“Our cancer trap works just like a roach motel, where you put in some bait and the roach goes there and dies,” said Liping Tang, UTA bioengineering professor and leader of the research. “We are putting biological agents in a cancer trap to attract and kill cancer cells.\n\n“This method is effective for both diagnosing and treating metastasis cancer and can be used in combination with traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy,” he added.\n\nCurrently, there are many treatments for primary tumors but they do little to prevent metastasis and stray cancer cells from relocating to another part of the body. Surgical removal of cancerous tissue also can spur the spread of cancer in the body. While there are drugs given to patients after surgery to prevent cancer cells from adhering to each other or other tissues, these drugs do not rid the body of cancer cells or collect them to allow an assessment of the patient’s status.\n\n“We have made a nano-sized device that we can put under the skin using an injection needle to recruit the cancer cells into a small area where we can treat them with less overall side effects to the whole body,” Tang said.\n\n“So the cancer trap is really complementary to current cancer treatments and especially beneficial at the early stages when it is difficult to see if the cancer is spreading as there are few cancer cells. We have also found it very effective in late stage cancers to stop the spread of the disease and to prolong lifespan,” he added.\n\nLiping Tang, UTA bioengineering professor and inventor of the cancer trap\n\nThe cancer trap works by releasing different chemokines or regulatory proteins to attract circulating cancer cells and then expose them to chemotherapeutic agents to eradicate potential spreading. The trap has been tested in the lab and proved effective on many kinds of cancer cells, including melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia and esophageal cancer.\n\n“We are hoping to move toward clinical trials in the next few years as this technology could potentially significantly increase the lifespan of cancer patients,” Tang said.\n\nThis work on cancer forms part of a larger program at UTA where more than 30 faculty from different colleges and disciplines are developing new solutions to attack this disease.\n\nWith more than $4 million in research expenditures in 2017, UTA’s program for cancer encompasses basic cancer research, identification and diagnostics, as well as in noninvasive, midterm, invasive and postoperative therapies. UTA’s multidisciplinary research teams harness proficiencies from across science, engineering, computer science, nursing and kinesiology to tackle the challenges of precision oncology and cancer treatment.\n\nTang’s expertise encompasses a broad area, including stem cells, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, biocompatibility, biomaterials, inflammation, infection and fibrosis. He has published much of his work in high impact journals, including Biomaterials, Journal of Clinical Investigation, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Blood, Journal of Experimental Medicine, and Tissue Engineering.\n\n“Tang is a remarkable innovator and internationally recognized researcher,” said Michael Cho, UTA’s chair of bioengineering. “His work is a clear example of UTA’s strategic focus on health and the human condition and of the strength of multidisciplinary work.”']","Based on the information in the release, the device appears to be — at this point — little more than a concept.","This news release announces the European patent for a medical device that is designed to attract, trap and kill cancer cells. Ostensibly, the device could be used to detect early signs of metastasis in various forms of cancer, and potentially could find use in cancer treatment.

She now has eight locations in New York, Florida and Israel. The Brooklyn salon, opened in April, has big boxes of lollipops and Twizzlers. Cartoons playing on a TV screen are interrupted by the constant ring of the phone and chatter of schoolchildren. A lice check at a local private school one day last week had brought a steady stream of business.\n\nSome six million to 12 million infestations of head lice occur each year in the U.S. in children ages 3 to 11 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite experts’ assurances that head lice pose no health concern, the insects are a regular source of angst for schools and families, who may spend as much as hundreds of dollars to get rid of them.\n\nAn enlarged view of Pediculus humanus--a human head louse. Photo: Getty Images\n\nLice have become increasingly resistant to widely used over-the-counter shampoos such as Nix or Rid, which contain permethrin or pyrethrins. While such products are still recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups as the first line of treatment, some doctors and parents are turning to new topical treatments, which are generally available by prescription. Also getting a boost are combing salons, some of which have expanded into multistate chains.\n\n“The process of combing out is the only way to get rid of all the lice and nits,” says Deborah Capone, who calls in Lice Busters’ employees when there is a lice outbreak at the three preschools she runs in Brooklyn.\n\nThe salons typically use a technique known as wet combing. Hair is doused in some sort of lubricant—often Pantene conditioner—and employees use a specially designed comb to remove the lice and nits. The conditioner loosens the pests and makes them easier to spot. The process can take more than an hour as hair is combed multiple times from different angles.\n\nLice Busters’ Ms. Harel says her two New York locations charge $20 for an initial check and $150 to $250 for a treatment, depending on hair length and how severe the infestation is. A recheck a week later is another $20. Employees also do house calls.\n\nCustomers at the Brooklyn salon say they come there to avoid applying chemicals on their children’s heads. “We can leave here relieved,” says one mom.\n\nKarin Kutasewich, owner of Lice Squad in Toronto, Ontario, works to remove lice from a customer’s hair. Adding conditioner makes the hair easier to comb through. Photo: Melissa Renwick/Getty Images\n\nThere are close to 1,000 lice-removal companies in the U.S. today, says Katie Shepherd, founder and chief executive of the Shepherd Institute for Lice Solutions, a nonprofit in West Palm Beach, Fla., that trains people who want to start a lice-combing business. By comparison, there were 42 such companies in 2009 when she published a book that detailed her method of nit removal. Ms. Shepherd also heads a company that tests lice products and she operates three lice-combing salons.\n\nSome experts criticize lice-combing businesses because they aren’t regulated. People who work in the salons tend to have no particular training in pest control or entomology, says Richard J. Pollack, a senior environmental public health officer at Harvard University. And most aren’t able to distinguish between debris and dandruff, and between a nit, a louse and some other kind of bug, says Dr. Pollack, who also runs a consulting business called IdentifyUS LLC that identifies bug specimens, mainly bed bugs and ticks, and offers guidance on managing pest problems.\n\nNewer prescription treatments have been shown to be safe and effective, and to have no serious side effects, according to an article published online in the journal Pediatric Dermatology last week that reviewed studies of the products. The effectiveness of traditional over-the-counter shampoos has dropped to about 25% from nearly 100% two decades ago, the researchers say. “Widespread and indiscriminate use” of the traditional products and mutations in lice made them resistant to the insecticides, they say.\n\nThe prescription products include benzyl alcohol, sold under the brand name Ulesfia; ivermectin, or Sklice; malathion, or Ovide lotion; and spinosad, sold as Natroba. The medications have been found to be from 68% to 87% effective after one or two applications. Most don’t require combing.\n\nThe review article’s authors, some of whom have consulted with pharmaceutical companies, also say there is no evidence for the effectiveness of some popular home remedies for lice, including dousing the hair in olive oil, petroleum jelly, mayonnaise or essential oils, practices that could also be unsafe.\n\n“We thought it was time to review some of these newer products so people would understand what control options they have,” says John Clark, a professor of environmental toxicology and chemistry at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and a co-author on the study.\n\nHaving multiple treatment options is important to help prevent the rapid development of resistance again, says Dr. Clark, whose research has documented the development of the mutations in lice believed to have contributed to their resistance to over-the-counter treatments. Dr. Clark says he has worked as a consultant for some of the companies that developed the prescription treatments, but has no current active research projects.\n\n“My guidance would be that the first step should be to contact a physician and ask for a visit and prescription,” says William Ryan, another co-author on the Pediatric Dermatology article. Dr. Ryan says he previously ran the development program for the company that created Sklice. He works as a consultant in the pharmaceutical industry but isn’t currenlty working for any companies with lice products.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and some other medical associations, including the National Association of School Nurses, still recommend OTC shampoos as the first line of treatment for lice unless resistance has been documented in a community.\n\nThe OTC treatments sometimes don’t seem to work because the lice diagnosis wasn’t accurate or the products aren’t used properly or the patient became reinfected, says Dawn Nolt, clinical associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, Ore.\n\nWhile the prescription drugs are effective, they are more expensive, says Dr. Nolt, who is on the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that developed last year’s updated lice recommendations. Prescription lice medications can cost as much as $300 and aren’t always covered by insurance.\n\nNatasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Kansas City, Mo., recommends parents first try the over-the-counter lice treatments because they are inexpensive and will still work in certain regions of the country. If those aren’t effective after one or two days, she suggests a prescription medication or occasionally oral antibiotics in combination with an OTC treatment.\n\n“Some parents don’t like to do the prescriptions because they think it’s more chemicals on their kid’s skin,” Dr. Burgert says. As for a combing salon, “It’s a nice option and it certainly gets the job done. It’s just very, very tedious.”\n\nWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com']",We were pleased to see how the story pointed out any potential conflicts of interest among the sources.,"The treatment of childhood cases of head lice infestations is a popular news media perennial at the start of the school year, and this Wall Street Journal story falls into that category.  It covers the usual elements — prevalence of the infestations among school age children, over-the-counter and prescription treatments, home remedies (which generally don’t work) and reassurance about the pesky but essentially benign health impact.

The improvements were more robust in those who were adherent to PAP therapy.\n\n""Quality of life is one of the most vital outcomes for patients and often one of the primary reasons to seek medical attention,"" said lead author and principal investigator Dr. Harneet Walia, assistant professor at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University and staff at the Cleveland Clinic\'s Sleep Disorders Center. ""We noted consistent improvement in global and sleep-specific quality-of-life measures after PAP therapy.""\n\nThe study is published in the Nov. 15 issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.\n\nNearly 30 million adults in the U.S. have obstructive sleep apnea, a chronic disease that involves the repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Common warning signs include snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. One treatment option for sleep apnea is PAP therapy, which uses mild levels of air pressure, provided through a mask, to keep the throat open while you sleep.\n\nThe study involved 2,027 patients with sleep apnea who began PAP therapy between Jan. 1, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2014. Participants had a mean age of 56 years, and about 54 percent were men. General quality of life measures, such as mobility and usual activity, were assessed using the European Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Sleep-specific quality of life was examined with the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), which assesses the effect of sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness on activities of daily living such as productivity and intimacy. Scores before and after up to one year of PAP therapy were compared.\n\nResults also show that older patients and those in a higher socioeconomic subgroup had better quality of life measures after PAP therapy.\n\n""Our study also serves as a basis for targeted efforts to optimize quality of life in younger adults and lower socioeconomic subgroups,"" said Walia. ""This information will guide clinicians in terms of expected quality of life outcomes with sleep apnea treatment."" The American Academy of Sleep Medicine previously identified quality of life as one of three sleep apnea outcome measures that clinicians can track to optimize care for adult patients. Implementation of a quality assurance program to track these quality measures can help improve patient outcomes, reduce the public health burden of sleep apnea, and provide a measurable standard for evaluating and managing sleep apnea.\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded by a scholar award from the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute-Center of Research Outcomes and Evaluation and by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nFor a copy of the study, ""Impact of Sleep-Disordered Breathing Treatment on Quality of Life Measures in a Large Clinic-Based Cohort,"" or to arrange an interview with a study author or an AASM spokesperson, please contact the AASM at 630-737-9700 or media@aasm.org.']",A few facts from the study along with the very basics — such as cost and harms of the intervention — would have improved this release.,"This news release from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine describes a large retrospective study that shows that positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy improves quality of life in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. PAP therapy is often given via CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines, and has been a standard treatment for sleep apnea for several decades. The release does a good job describing the study itself, and how the authors broke down patients into subgroups that compared age and socio-economic status.
But the release also left much to be desired: it didn’t describe the limitations of retrospective studies or adequately discuss the harms or costs of these machines, which can be prohibitively expensive for some patients. Most importantly, the news release did not do a good job of establishing the novelty of this study. While there was a large sample size and various measures of quality of life, it is still unclear how this study is new since the benefits of CPAP are already well known.

But now, new research suggests that the benefits of short-term hormone treatment to control life-disrupting menopausal symptoms outweigh the risks — as long as the treatment is started at or near menopause.\n\nThere are also lots of products now available and different ways to use them that enhance the safety of hormone replacement. And there is even an app to help women and their doctors explore various options and choose the most suitable treatment.\n\nFor women without a history of cancer, blood clots or heart disease, most professional medical societies concerned with women’s health now recommend treatment for menopausal symptoms for up to five years using therapy that combines estrogen and progesterone and even longer for those who take estrogen alone.\n\nEvery day, about 6,000 women in the United States — more than two million women a year — enter menopause. At an average age of 51, they stop having their periods because their ovaries no longer produce enough estrogen to stimulate growth of the uterine lining that is shed each menstrual cycle.\n\nFor months before and up to a decade or more after menopause begins, many women have symptoms that can seriously diminish the quality of their lives by disrupting their productivity, sleep, moods and ability to enjoy sexual intercourse.\n\nThe most common symptom — hot flashes — can leave some women dripping with sweat for minutes at a time several times a day and especially during the night. Menopause-related vaginal dryness and atrophy can result in severe sexual discomfort, pain and bleeding with exercise, vaginal and urinary infections and incontinence.\n\nUntil the early 2000s, many women with menopausal symptoms took hormone replacement therapy — H.R.T. — to counter them. Even some who did not have disturbing symptoms used H.R.T. because observational studies indicated it lowered the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and popular books and articles suggested it delayed signs of aging.\n\nThen in 2002, the results of the largest randomized clinical trial of hormone replacement, the Women’s Health Initiative (W.H.I.), created a kind of menopausal panic, prompting millions of middle-age women to stop or not start hormone treatments and doctors to not prescribe them.\n\nThe study found that, among the women treated with the hormones, there was an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and, most frightening of all to many women, a slightly higher risk of breast cancer among those randomized to take the leading H.R.T. regimen of conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin) and a synthetic progesterone (Provera) recommended for women who still had a uterus. (Those without a uterus, who were randomized to take conjugated estrogens alone, had no increase in breast cancer; in fact, they had a slight decrease over all.)\n\nThe hormone combination did protect against hip fractures and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but for the overwhelming majority of menopausal women, the risks of H.R.T. seemed — on the surface — to outweigh the benefits.\n\nHowever, according to Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, an endocrinologist and one of the principal investigators for the W.H.I., “The W.H.I. findings have been seriously misunderstood and misinterpreted,” and millions of women for whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks are needlessly being denied treatment. “The pendulum has swung too far,” she said.\n\nThe W.H.I. study actually had nothing to do with menopausal symptoms. Most of the 27,347 women entering the study were already in their 60s and 70s, already a decade or more past menopause. Rather, the study was designed to determine whether H.R.T. did, in fact, reduce the risk of heart disease, the leading killer of American women. Among these older women, it found no such effect.\n\nIn the years after the W.H.I. findings, many new analyses and studies have prompted experts to rethink the wisdom of avoiding hormone replacement, especially for women within a few years of menopause whose personal and family history do not place them at high risk of breast cancer.\n\nExperts like Dr. Manson, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham & Women’s Hospital, maintain that the results of the W.H.I. study are not relevant to the more common use of H.R.T. for women in their 50s and for those experiencing earlier menopause as a result of medical treatments.\n\nDr. Howard N. Hodis, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Southern California, said the billion-dollar W.H.I. study made “a big mistake” by starting the hormones in older women, when cardiovascular damage may have already occurred. “The cardiovascular protection found in observational studies involved women who were younger and within a few years of menopause when they started taking H.R.T.,” he said.\n\nIn a Danish randomized controlled trial of 1,006 women entering menopause, among those given hormones for 10 years, “there was a reduction in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer — a clear benefit with nominal risk,” Dr. Hodis said. These benefits persisted after 16 years of follow-up, according to the study, which was published in 2012.\n\nDr. Hodis is especially disturbed about the reluctance to prescribe estrogens for menopausal women who have had a hysterectomy and don’t need progesterone to prevent endometrial cancer.\n\nIn an analysis in 2013 in the American Journal of Public Health, Dr. Philip M. Sarrel and his co-authors calculated that, based on reduced death rates among women taking only estrogen in the W.H.I. study, avoiding hormone replacement resulted in the premature deaths of 18,601 to 91,610 women in the decade after the study’s release.\n\nDr. Manson is distressed about the large number of women — about a third of those now on hormone replacement — who are relying on “custom-compounded” products that have not been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the Food and Drug Administration. They come with no warnings in a package insert and could contain contaminants and inconsistent dosages, she said.\n\n“There’s little or no reason to go the custom-compound route,” she said. “Women today have so many options — a wide array of doses, from low to traditional, and ways to use them.” In addition to pills, there are patches, gels and sprays applied to the skin. Vaginal and urinary symptoms can be treated with vaginal inserts containing very small amounts of estrogen that do not enter the bloodstream and thus are safe for women who have had breast cancer.\n\nTo help women and their doctors assess H.R.T. options and select the best treatment for women 45 and older with menopausal symptoms, the North American Menopause Society has developed a mobile app, MenoPro, for iPhone/iPad and Android devices.\n\nRelated:\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.']","When clinical research is mentioned in this blog post, no specifics are given on the measured benefits or harms.","In this New York Times’ Well blog post, the gist of the text is supporting the idea that old fears about the health risks of hormone replacement therapy for women have been rethought and new conclusions should reassure the public about its safe use–especially in short-term (fewer than 5 years) relief of menopausal systems.
The post mentions that HRT has been used in two ways: to treat menopause symptoms, and to prevent chronic disease. But the information is relayed in a somewhat confusing, incomplete way. For example, there was no discussion of where the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force falls on the idea of using HRT to prevent chronic disease. (They recommend against it.) When clinical research is mentioned, no specifics are given on the measured benefits or harms.

Although the tumors were small, these cancers can spread to lymph nodes under the arm, which can allow the tumors to spread around the body through the lymph system.\n\nAs a precaution, doctors usually remove some of these lymph nodes. But that surgery can be painful and lead to an incurable and sometimes disabling condition called lymphedema, which causes the arm to swell.\n\nIn recent years, doctors have made an effort to spare women from this complication by first removing only one or two crucial lymph nodes, called the sentinel nodes. If those nodes contain cancer, doctors remove many of the other lymph nodes. If the sentinel nodes are cancer-free, doctors leave the others in place, greatly reducing the risk of lymphedema.\n\nIn this study, doctors found that it\'s not necessary to take out additional lymph nodes, even if they find cancer in the sentinel ones. About 92% of women were alive after five years, whether or not the extra lymph nodes were removed, according to the study, conducted at 115 locations around the USA and funded by the National Cancer Institute.\n\nResults of the study were presented at a medical meeting last summer, and some surgeons are already changing their practices. The University of Washington-Seattle Cancer Care Alliance began removing fewer lymph nodes at the end of last year, ""after a faculty retreat and lots of discussion,"" professor Julie Gralow says.\n\nThe findings apply to only a small number of breast cancer patients. On average, the women in the study were in their 50s, and women who had mastectomies weren\'t included, Gralow says.\n\nAlso, women in the study had small tumors, with only one or two affected lymph nodes, says Mehra Golshan, of Boston\'s Dana Farber/Brigham and Women\'s Cancer Center. The findings may not apply to women with three or four affected lymph nodes or larger tumors. And doctors don\'t yet know how the women will fare in the long term, because researchers followed them for only six years, he says.\n\nThe American Cancer Society\'s Otis Brawley doesn\'t think doctors will change their methods overnight.\n\nEven so, depending on the results of other ongoing research, this study may influence medical practice over the next three to five years, he says.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Good job in a short story, but for more depth and decision-making help, women would get more out of the 3,500-word </span>","Improved quality of life, with no reduction in survival.

So, that these results were so positive for something that’s very safe is an impressive accomplishment.”\n\nRecent studies have suggested that tai chi, with its slow exercises, breathing and meditation, could benefit patients with other chronic conditions, including arthritis. But not all of these reports have been conclusive, and tai chi is hard to study because there are many styles and approaches.\n\nThe fibromyalgia study involved the yang style of tai chi, taught by a Boston tai chi master, Ramel Rones. Dr. Solomon and other experts cautioned that bigger studies with other masters and approaches were necessary.\n\nStill, patients, who received twice-weekly tai chi classes and a DVD to practice with 20 minutes daily, showed weekly improvement on an established measurement, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, improving more than the stretching-and-education group in physicians’ assessments, sleep, walking and mental health.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nDr. Chenchen Wang, a Tufts rheumatologist who led the study, said she attributed the results to the fact that “fibromyalgia is a very complex problem” and “tai chi has multiple components — physical, psychological, social and spiritual.”\n\nThe therapy impressed Mary Petersen, 59, a retired phone company employee from Lynn, Mass., who said that before participating in the 2008 study, “I couldn’t walk half a mile,” and it “hurt me so much just to put my hands over my head.” Sleeping was difficult, and she was overweight. “There was no joy to life,” she said. “I was an entire mess from head to foot.”\n\nShe had tried and rejected medication, physical therapy, swimming and other approaches. “I was used to being treated in a condescending manner because they couldn’t diagnose me: ‘She’s menopausal, she’s crazy.’ ”\n\nBefore the study, “I didn’t know tai chi from a sneeze,” said Ms. Petersen, who has diabetes and other conditions. “I was like, ‘Well, O.K., I’ll get to meet some people, it will get me out of the house.’ I didn’t believe any of it. I thought this is so minimal, it’s stupid.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a few weeks, she said she began to feel better, and after 12 weeks “the pain had diminished 90 percent.” She has continued tai chi, lost 50 pounds and can walk three to seven miles a day.\n\n“You could not have convinced me that I would ever have done this or continued with this,” she said. “I wouldn’t say it’s a cure. I will say it’s an effective method of controlling pain.”\n\nDr. Shmerling said that though tai chi is inexpensive compared with other treatments, some patients would reject such an alternative therapy. And Dr. Gloria Yeh, a Beth Israel Deaconess internist and co-author of the editorial, said others “will say, ‘It’s too slow, I can’t do that.’ ”\n\nBut she said it offered a “gentler option” for patients deterred by other physical activities. “The mind-body connections set it apart from other exercises,” she said, adding that doctors are seeking “anything we can offer that will make patients say ‘I can really do this.’ ”""]",The best of the five stories we reviewed on the same study.  Read why. ," This is a well considered look at a limited study of an unusual approach to a disorder that has stumped clinicians for decades. It is the only one of the five stories we reviewed that quoted a patient about her experience. This has pluses and minuses. The patient’s extraordinary improvement after tai chi could give reader’s the impression that it will work for everyone. At the same time, it shows that the reporter attempted to gather a fuller picture of the study than most of the other reporters covering it.

He\'s a professor of anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\nThe dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells, on both sides of each of the spine\'s vertebra, and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body, spinal cord and brain. Stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain, the researchers explained.\n\nA pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness. The strength of stimulation, programmed by a doctor, is based on the patient\'s level of pain, he said.\n\nThe treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. In spinal cord stimulation, a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine, but the pulses don\'t target the specific pain source.\n\nIn addition, dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain, McCarthy said.\n\nThe goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. McCarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in 67 people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to 18 months. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year.\n\nBefore receiving the device, most patients rated their pain as an 8 on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst. For most patients, the device reduced pain by 33 percent, which was significant, the researchers reported.\n\nIn addition, patients said they experienced a 27 percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain. In all, 94 percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial.\n\nThe procedure was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.\n\nMcCarthy said the therapy is not widely available, even though it was approved by the FDA in 2016. At the moment, its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.\n\nAlso, the procedure isn\'t covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.\n\nFor uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.\n\nSpine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies may have varying policies.\n\nMcCarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available, especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain.\n\nOne pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure.\n\n""The results of this study are very significant,"" said Dr. Kiran Patel, director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nIt shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.\n\n""In my pain practice and career, dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain,"" Patel said.\n\n""I encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate,"" she said.\n\nThe findings were presented Sunday at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, in San Francisco. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke for more on back pain.']",But the story did a good job of reporting on the cost and availability of this procedure.,"This story reports on an study of 67 people with chronic back pain, most of whom reported feeling at least a little better after they had a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulator implanted in their spine.

Not long after, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n""Fast forward now, and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening,"" Stecker says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography/Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography/Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography\n\nStecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called Wheelchair Kamikaze.\n\nMore than a year ago, Stecker started writing about a theory Italian physician Paolo Zamboni proposed in 2008 called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.\n\nIt\'s been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and death. However, Zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins — leading to inflammation, which, in turn, causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nZamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. Stecker was hopeful.\n\n""Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it,"" Stecker says.\n\nThe \'Liberation Procedure\'\n\nTo clear the veins, his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon. Zamboni calls it ""the liberation procedure"" but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it\'s used to open clogged arteries — not veins.\n\nA Brief History Of Multiple Sclerosis In 1822, Augustus D\'Este, the grandson of England\'s King George III, began documenting his illness, which would one day be identified as multiple sclerosis. Since D\'Este\'s day, researchers have learned how to better treat the disease, but have not yet found a cure. Here is a timeline of some key events along the way.\n\n1868: Scientists identify multiple sclerosis as a distinct condition. 1878: Myelin, which insulates nerve fibers, is discovered. In MS, the body erodes the myelin, which damages nerve fibers and interrupts brain signals. 1916: Using a microscope James Dawson examines the brains of people who died from MS. He is able to describe in depth the damage done by the disease. 1969: Researchers use a hormone typically made by the pituitary gland to treat the symptoms of MS. 1981: The MRI is first used to help diagnose MS, reducing diagnosis time from seven years to six months after the first symptom. 1993: Doctors begin using a drug called Beta interferon 1-b to reduce disease flare-ups. 2008: Paolo Zamboni proposes the theory Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency. — From the National Multiple Sclerosis Society\n\n""At first, I was very skeptical. But anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it.…So, I decided, you know, hey it was worth a shot,"" Stecker says.\n\nBut it didn\'t work. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says.\n\nStill, some would say Stecker was lucky. Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later. Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as ""stents,"" placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots. Several patients have even died as a result.\n\nStecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. But he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure.\n\n""CCSVI equals hope and a lot of MS patients just are completely devoid of hope,"" Stecker says. ""People don\'t want to have MS. They want to go back to who they used to be. You know, along comes this theory that offers an easy-to-understand solution, so it\'s very, very, very seductive.""\n\nGrowing Public Controversy\n\n\n\nIt\'s so seductive, in fact, that Canadians and Americans with MS have been flocking overseas to get the ""liberation procedure."" Something that many researchers find very troubling. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography\n\n""Even if the treatment is not useful for patients with MS, I don\'t think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in MS,"" Zivadinov says. ""And I think this merits very detailed understanding of what is going on.""\n\nWhat is going on is still a bit of a mystery. Critics argue that although Zamboni\'s original research suggests a vascular cause for MS, other studies don\'t. These discrepancies, and growing public controversy, prompted the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the U.S. and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada to take Zamboni\'s claims seriously. They funded a number of independent studies to investigate the relationship between CCSVI and MS.\n\nRobert Fox, a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic, currently oversees one of the studies funded by an MS Society grant. He says part of the confusion comes from variations in how CCSVI is measured.\n\n""That\'s absolutely one of the potential problems in the previous studies: Are the techs who got negative results, did they just not know how to do the ultrasound in the way that Dr. Zamboni described doing the ultrasound?

But the standard PSA test cannot distinguish between cancers that grow so slowly they can safely be left alone and aggressive life-threatening tumors that call for surgery or radiation therapy.\n\nThe new test measures blood levels of three different types of PSA. Combined with annual biopsies, or tissue samples, it was about 70 percent accurate in singling out the aggressive tumors in a small study, John Hopkins University researchers were to report Sunday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, in Washington, D.C.\n\n""What we have shown is that using the Prostate Health Index and tissue DNA measurement is informative in separating out patients whose cancers are likely to progress vs. those that are not likely to progress,"" said study leader Robert W. Veltri, an associate professor of urology and oncology at Hopkins.\n\nProstate Health Index is the name given to the test by Beckman Coulter Inc., which plans to market it.\n\nThe study included 71 men originally diagnosed as having small, low-grade and low-stage prostate cancer, the kind whose ultimate aggressiveness is often in doubt.\n\nCurrently, identifying the dangerous tumors in that group is no better than ""a coin-flip,"" Veltri said, and, as a result, many men and their doctors choose treatment that might be unnecessary and can cause impotence and other major problems.\n\nMen in the trial had periodic blood tests that measured three different forms of PSA, including pro-PSA, a molecule in which two of the amino acids that make up the protein have been clipped off. It is the pro-PSA level that is most valuable as a predictor, Veltri said, but it is only one part of the study.\n\nThe new PSA test is given twice a year, along with a digital rectal exam to determine the size of the tumor, and a yearly biopsy. The regimen found unfavorable indications for 39 of the cancers -- meaning progression of cancer grade or tumor size -- and favorable for the 32 others, Veltri said. ""When you combine the DNA reading and the serum Prostate Health Index, it is accurate in about 7 out of 10 cases,"" he said.\n\nBut it was a small study, and ""it will take another year or two to get enough cases to nail down the predictive index,"" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins group is trying to identify other biomarkers that would improve the program\'s predictive value, he said. One hope is that the now-annual biopsies could be done every other year, Veltri said.\n\nThe study results have caused ""excitement,"" he said. ""Through active surveillance, we can identify a set of prostate cancer patients with low-grade tumors that may be able to have intervention deferred or delayed,"" Veltri said.\n\nThe Hopkins work was described as ""outstanding"" by Dr. William J. Catalona, director of the prostate cancer program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital\'s Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, who pioneered the use of the standard PSA test and helped develop the new version of the test.\n\nThe test is awaiting approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and already is approved for use in Europe, Catalona said. In a study of 2,000 men in the Chicago area, ""we found it to be more accurate than the tests now available, and it also seems to identify the more aggressive prostate cancers,"" he said.\n\nAnother report at the same meeting described use of a microchip to detect tumor cells in the blood of people with prostate cancer. The presence of circulating cells can indicate spread of the cancer to other parts of the body, but they are so rare that they are invisible to current technology.\n\nThe new circulating tumor cell (CTC) chip identified such cells in nearly half of 20 people with early-stage prostate cancer and in two-thirds of people with advanced cancer, providing important prognostic information, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital reported.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn about diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer from the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']",The language of the story was more persuasive about the success of the tests reported on than the current data suggest. ,"The bottom line is that the value of the new test remains quite uncertain.  The study’s sample size was small, the follow-up period appeared relatively short, and the accuracy statistics were difficult to interpret.   The story reports on a study in 71 men, but allows another source to throw in unsourced information about a Chicago-area study in 2,000 men.

Seaman\n\n(Reuters Health) - Women who take part in exercise, diet programs or a combination of the two during pregnancy can prevent excessive weight gain, according to a fresh review of past research.\n\nThe review incorporates dozens of new studies to update a previous review that did not find enough evidence to support the use of diet and exercise during pregnancy.\n\nAfter including the new studies, the new review found “high-quality evidence” to show diet, exercise or both can reduce the risk of excessive weight gain during pregnancy, write the researchers in The Cochrane Library.\n\nOther benefits may include a lower risk of cesarean delivery, excessive birth weight, and respiratory\n\nproblems in the newborn, “particularly for high-risk women receiving combined diet and exercise interventions,” add the researchers, led by Benja Muktabhant of Khon Kaen University in Thailand.\n\nThe U.S. Institute of Medicine says the amount of weight women should gain during pregnancy varies depending on their non-pregnancy weight.\n\nFor example, a normal-weight woman should gain between 25 and 35 pounds, while an overweight woman should gain between 15 and 25 pounds. Obese women should gain even less.\n\nGaining too much weight is tied to an increased risk of complications for both mother and child, according to the researchers, who completed the review for The Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research.\n\nFor the new review, the researchers examined data from 65 randomized controlled trials, which are considered the “gold standard” of medical research. They were able to combine data from 49 trials involving a total of 11,444 pregnant women.\n\nThe women were randomly assigned to a diet, exercise, a combination of the two or standard care. The diets and exercise programs varied, but could include low-glycemic diets and unsupervised exercise.\n\nWomen who took part in diet, exercise or combination programs were about 20 percent less likely than women in standard-care groups to gain too much weight while pregnant, the researchers report.\n\nThe women who took part in diet, exercise and combination programs were also less likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy, compared to those in the standard care group.\n\nThere was no clear benefit among the women in the diet and exercise groups when the researchers looked at other complications, such as cesarean delivery, but it did look like there may be some benefit, they write.\n\nWhile the new study generally did not show fewer complications in the diet and exercise group, Dr. Loralei Thornburg told Reuters Health that it’s good that there was no increase in complications.\n\n“This was very reassuring that there wasn’t an increased risk of preterm birth with moderate exercise,” said Thornburg, a high-risk pregnancy expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\n\n“Most people gain more weight than they probably should during pregnancy,” Thornburg, who was not involved with the review, told Reuters Health.\n\nShe said women who gain too much weight may not be able to lose it after the baby is born. Then, during the next pregnancy the woman is already heavier and that may increase the risk of complications.\n\n“In the next pregnancy, if you don’t get it off, you may go from obese to very obese,” Thornburg said.\n\nShe cautioned, however, that women should check with their doctors before starting a diet and exercise program during pregnancy.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1C3lYDc The Cochrane Library, online June 11, 2015.']","This story had a solid foundation, but lacked a few important details that would have made the coverage more thorough and informative.","The story recaps a recent paper that reviewed the medical literature on the effect of exercise and diet programs on pregnant women. The story reports that women who took part in exercise, diet programs, or both, were less likely to gain too much weight during pregnancy. And it does a good job of defining the guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy for women of different body weights. However, the story could have quantified the potential benefits of diet and exercise programs in a more precise and meaningful way. In addition, it suggests that such programs reduce the risk of other health-related outcomes without clarifying the variability of evidence to support those claims (many results for these benefits were not statistically significant). The story also didn’t note that diet and exercise programs increased the risk of low pregnancy weight gain, which, like excessive weight gain, is associated with a variety of adverse health effects.

This technology is a way to directly measure how much fluid is in a patient, allowing us to intervene before they develop symptoms of congestion, before they end up in hospital. This is a big game-changer.”\n\nFunded by the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, the device called CardioMEMS™ HF System was successfully implanted by interventional cardiologists at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in March 2017. The system features a small butterfly-like sensor that then sits inside the pulmonary artery of a heart failure patient. When the patient lies on an accompanying antenna-equipped pillow device, the sensor provides important data – including the patient’s lung pressure readings to clinicians – via a secure website.\n\n“Never before have we had the ability to obtain a patient’s accurate lung pressure data while they are outside the hospital,” said Meredith Linghorne, nurse practitioner, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. “Traditionally we’ve relied on a patient describing symptoms, and by then they may have already progressed to the point of hospitalization. With this device, we can see warning signs days in advance, and adjust treatment accordingly.”\n\nThe most rapidly rising cardiovascular disease in Canada, heart failure affects close to one million Canadians, and an estimated 26 million people globally. In Canada, heart failure patients stay an average of almost 10 days for each hospital admission, accounting for 1.4 million hospital stays a year. These patients live an average of 2.1 years after diagnosis and cost the Canadian health-care system more than $3 billion annually. About one-quarter of these patients return to hospital within three months, while approximately 50 per cent return to hospital within six months.\n\nThe CardioMEMS™ HF System is designed to monitor heart failure patients whose condition is serious but who are not so ill that the technology cannot improve their outcome. The first Canadian patient implanted with the heart monitor will be among 25 patients within the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre to be fitted with the device over the next nine months.\n\nProduced by Abbott, the CardioMEMSÔ HF System is approved in the United States by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and is currently awaiting approval by Health Canada.\n\n- 30 -\n\nVideo interview: Dr. Heather Ross, cardiologist, and Meredith Linghorne, nurse practitioner.\n\nABOUT THE TED ROGERS CENTRE FOR HEART RESEARCH\n\nThe Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research aims to develop new diagnoses, treatments and tools to prevent and individually manage heart failure – Canada’s fastest growing cardiac disease. Enabled by an unprecedented gift of $130 million from the Rogers family, the Centre was jointly conceived by its three partner organizations: the Hospital for Sick Children, University Health Network, and the University of Toronto. Together, they committed an additional $139 million toward the Centre – representing a $270 million investment in basic science, translational and clinical research, innovation, and education in regenerative medicine, genomics, and the clinical care of children and adults. It is addressing heart failure across the lifespan. www.tedrogersresearch.ca / @trogersresearch\n\nABOUT THE PETER MUNK CARDIAC CENTRE\n\nThe Peter Munk Cardiac Centre is the premier cardiac centre in Canada. Since it opened in 1997, the Centre has saved and improved the lives of cardiac and vascular patients from around the world. Each year, approximately 55,000 patients receive innovative and compassionate care from multidisciplinary teams in the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, and the Centre trains more cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons and vascular surgeons than any other hospital in Canada. The Centre is based at the Toronto General Hospital and the Toronto Western Hospital - members of University Health Network. www.petermunkcardiaccentre.ca']",An anecdote doesn’t constitute good scientific evidence. Where are the data?,"This news release covers the first implantation of a device called CardioMEMS in a Canadian heart failure patient. The wireless device includes a butterfly-like sensor, which sits inside the patient’s pulmonary artery and sends pressure readings to a secure website.
No other context or data are given. Although CardioMEMS is “novel” in Canada, the US has implanted the device in patients since 2007, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for market in 2014.
We would have liked to have seen some outcome data from the CHAMPION trial, which followed 550 heart failure patients for around 15 months to see whether patients with CardioMEMS devices would require fewer heart failure-related hospitalizations. Instead, we are told that this one Canadian patient’s implantation procedure in March was “successful,” without any further information on how the patient is doing now and may do in the future.
Finally, the news release uses terms like “big game-changer” for the device and refers to heart failure as an “epidemic.” In these types of announcements, we like to see more neutral and cautious wording for medical stories, especially since the news release doesn’t mention the costs and harms associated with this device.

The authors presented their findings February 2 at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2018 in San Diego.\n\nThe findings could influence how neurologists prescribe the medication. ""Neurologists have been looking for safer ways to administer natalizumab infusions to their patients, but there hasn\'t been clear data on whether decreasing dosing frequency improves safety,"" says first study author Lana Zhovtis Ryerson, MD, assistant professor of neurology at NYU School of Medicine and an attending neurologist at NYU Langone\'s Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center. ""Our safety findings are clinically and statistically significant, and we believe that extending the dosing schedule of natalizumab is practice changing and may save lives.""\n\nNatalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to prevent MS relapses, improve quality of life, and slow worsening disability. The medication is indicated to be prescribed in 300-milligram infusion doses every 4 weeks.\n\nTaking the medication longer than two years, however, may increase risk PML, which is caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). There have been 756 PML cases reported worldwide as of January 2018, with a global incidence rate of 4.19 per 1,000 PML cases in people treated with natalizumab. Patients who test JCV antibody-positive are typically either told to not to start natalizumab, or have had treatment stopped after two years, when risk was deemed to be too high.\n\nThe new study, however, reports safety data through up to 72 months, or 6 years, when the extended dosing regimens were applied, with risk reduction for PML as high as 94 percent.\n\nHow the Study Was Conducted\n\nResearchers reviewed data on all patients who have been exposed to JCV who are enrolled in TOUCH, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for natalizumab that requires manufacturers to document all uses of a medication to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Since the optimal extended dose schedule is not known, researchers chose to look at the data in multiple ways, with the primary definition looking at extended dose history in the last 18 months, the secondary definition looking at extended dose occurring at any time in the dosing history, and for tertiary definition looking primarily at how extended dose history affects PML risk. The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions.\n\nThe new study did not look at drug efficacy comparing extended to standard doses. However, previous research led by Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson\'s group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication\'s efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people. The authors are planning prospective efficacy studies of extended dose natalizumab.\n\nNatalizumab is manufactured by Biogen Idec and Elan, and sold under the name Tysabri®. Biogen provided the researchers access to their data and statistical support.\n\nOther infusion disease-modifying therapies approved to treat MS include the drugs alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab. Oral and injectable medications are also prescribed.\n\n###\n\nThe study was carried out in collaboration with Biogen and academic collaborators from NYU School of Medicine\'s Division of Biostatics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, and Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Clinic in Utah.\n\nIn addition to Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson, Ilya Kister, MD, associate professor of neurology, Judith D. Goldberg, professor of population health and environmental medicine, and Xiaochun Li, PhD, research scientist of biostatistics, were co-authors at NYU Langone Health. Other co-authors include Dr. John Foley, Dr. Ih Chang, Professor Gary R. Cutter, Dr. Ryan Metzger, Dr. Evan Riddle, Dr. Bei Yu, Dr. Zheng Ren, Dr. Christophe Hotermans, Dr. Pei-Ran Ho, and Dr. Nolan Campbell.']",The news releases also left out mention of several major conflicts of interest.,"Researchers referenced in this news release presented study findings last week at a national multiple sclerosis (MS) meeting suggesting that giving the drug natalizumab less frequently may dramatically reduce the risk for developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection.
The news release describes the study design well but could have served readers better by including more about costs, harms, significant conflicts of interest, and some important limitations of the study.

Australian revised National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for obesity management say that lap band surgery should be considered in adolescents with severe obesity – that is with a body mass index (BMI) over 40 kg/m2 or over 35 kg/m2 (weight/height2) with the presence of obesity-related diseases and who don’t respond to medical treatment. However there is no data available in Australian adolescents beyond 24 months post-surgery.\n\n“We are talking about a group of adolescents with severe obesity and significant health and psychological problems related to their increased weight – this is not for everyone,” says corresponding author and Paediatric Endocrinologist Dr Alexia Peña, who is a Senior Lecturer with the University of Adelaide’s Robinson Research Institute.\n\nThe study found that weight and BMI improved significantly at all follow-up times following surgery from three months through to 45 months and, in some cases, as long as five years. BMI loss was between 7.1 and 14.7 kg/m2.\n\n“The median BMI reduction of 10 kg/m2 with the lap band is a good result when compared to BMI reduction using the few medications available or lifestyle measures, which is around 1-3 kg/m2,” says Dr Peña. “Lap band surgery is reversible and allows time for adolescents to mature to make a more informed decision on a permanent surgical procedure if required later on in life. This is not the case for other surgeries currently offered for obesity management.\n\n“It is also important that teenagers undergoing this surgery have access to an experienced surgeon as part of a multidisciplinary paediatric team of doctors and Health professionals to ensure there is long-term regular follow-up.”\n\nPaediatric surgeon Mr Sanjeev Khurana, who did all the lap band surgeries between 2009 and 2013, says lap band surgery is a reversible surgical procedure that can be safely used in teens with severe obesity.\n\n“Although gastric banding has been controversial and is currently less used in adults with severe obesity, lap band surgery is one of the most studied surgeries for obesity management, has a high safety record and can be a temporary option to manage severe obesity during adolescence,” says Mr Khurana, who is also a Senior Lecturer in the University of Adelaide’s Discipline of Paediatrics.\n\n“Our findings support lap band surgery as a safe and effective option for management of adolescents with severe obesity – provided it is performed by an experienced surgeon and managed afterwards in a paediatric multidisciplinary environment with regular follow-up until adulthood.”\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nDr Alexia Peña, Paediatric Endocrinologist and Senior Lecturer, Robinson Research Institute, University of Adelaide.

The release states that two-thirds of the teens lost significant amounts of weight for up to five years and further describes the procedure as “a first option” to manage obesity during adolescence.
Researchers quoted in the text repeatedly and appropriately cautioned that the procedure “is not for everyone” and requires careful management, but the release remained determinedly cheery about the outcome. Importantly, it also failed to acknowledge the small sample size in this study and the lack of a control group,  as well as the health complications that stymied a few of the participants. Also ignored was that one-third of the 21 participants either failed to lose weight or began to regain it over the course of the study. Lap band surgery for severely obese teens is clearly no panacea.

Marketers of genetic tests claim the answer is in mail-order kits costing less than $200.\n\nSome customers say the test results help them steer their children to appropriate sports. But skeptical doctors and ethicists say the tests are putting profit before science and have a much greater price tag — potentially robbing perfectly capable youngsters of a chance to enjoy activities of their choice.\n\n""In the `winning is everything\' sports culture, societal pressure to use these tests in children may increasingly present a challenge to unsuspecting physicians,"" according to a commentary in Wednesday\'s Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nScientists have identified several genes that may play a role in determining strength, speed and other aspects of athletic performance. But there are likely hundreds more, plus many other traits and experiences that help determine athletic ability, said Dr. Alison Brooks, a pediatrician and sports medicine specialist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.\n\nBrooks and University of Michigan physician Dr. Beth Tarini wrote the commentary to raise awareness about the issue.\n\nA handful of companies are selling these tests online. In some cases, the tests screen for genes that are common even among non-athletes. As science advances, Brooks said, ""My guess is we\'re going to see more of this, not less.""\n\nBradley Marston of Bountiful, Utah, bought a test online a year ago for his daughter Elizabeth, then 9.\n\nShe\'s ""a very talented soccer player,"" and Marston wanted to know if she had a variation of a gene called ACTN3, which influences production of a protein involved in certain muscle activity.\n\nOne form of the gene has been linked with explosive bursts of strength needed for activities such as sprinting and weight lifting.\n\nThe ACTN3 test sold by Atlas Sports Genetics was developed by Genetic Technologies Limited, an Australian firm. Atlas\' $169 kit consists of two swabs to scrape cells from the inside of the cheek. Customers return the used swabs to the Boulder, Colo., company and receive an analysis several days later.\n\nElizabeth Marston\'s test showed she has a sprinting-related gene form — results her father hopes will help her get into elite sports programs or win a sports scholarship to college.\n\nMarston said he ordered the test partly out of curiosity, but approached it cautiously and talked with Elizabeth to make sure she could handle it.\n\n""She told me, `Well, Daddy, I just have to try harder\'"" if the results came back negative, Marston said.\n\nElizabeth has loved soccer since age 4 and said she\'s happy with the results.\n\nBut even at age 10, she knows it will take more than genes to reach her goal of playing in the Olympics.\n\n""I think I would have to train hard,"" she said.\n\nNat Carruthers, operations president for Atlas Sports Genetics, says the company has sold several hundred test kits since it began marketing them in 2008.\n\n""Our goal is to help people become the athlete they were born to be,"" not to exclude kids from certain sports, Carruthers said.\n\nHe said critics have misrepresented the test ""to sound like we\'re telling parents what their kid should do and how good their kid will be. That\'s not at all our claim or desire,"" he said.\n\nCyGene Laboratories, based in Coral Springs, Fla., sold a similar $100 swab test online for different sports-related genes until last fall, but it has suspended operations.\n\nCyGene also sold kits online advertised as testing for human diseases, but Mark Munzer, the company\'s former president, said that industry is reeling from a Food and Drug Administration crackdown last year on efforts to sell disease-related gene tests in retail pharmacies.\n\nThe FDA scheduled a hearing on Tuesday to receive feedback from an expert panel on how the agency should be regulating direct-to-consumer genetic tests that make medical claims. Marketers of sports gene tests that don\'t make medical claims aren\'t FDA regulated.\n\nUniversity of Maryland researcher Stephen Roth, a specialist in exercise physiology and genetics who has studied the ACTN3 gene, said the science of how genes influence athletic ability ""is in its infancy"" and that marketers\' claims are based on ""gross assumptions.""\n\nRoth said roughly 80 percent of people worldwide have the ACTN3 gene that has been linked with explosive force. The fact that few of them become elite athletes underscores that it takes more than genes to make a sports star.\n\nAlso, about 20 percent of people have a gene variation that inhibits production of the protein involved in explosive force. That doesn\'t mean they can\'t excel in sports, Roth said, citing a Spanish long jumper who made it to the Olympics despite lacking that protein.\n\nDr. Lainie Friedman Ross, a medical ethicist and pediatrician at the University of Chicago, said the tests raise ethical questions when used in children because they\'re too young to understand the possible ramifications and to give adequate consent.\n\n""This is recreational genetics with a real serious potential for harm,"" Ross said. ""People are going to think, `If my kid has this, I\'m going to have to push real hard. If my kid doesn\'t have it, I\'m going to give up before I start,"" she said. Instead, Ross said, parents should ""let kids follow their dreams.""\n\n""While parents have the authority to make health care decisions about their children, this type of genetic testing is elective at best and should actively involve the children in the decision-making process,"" Ross said.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nJAMA: http://jama.ama-assn.org']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">Nice job summarizing the potential ethical and psychological impact of home gene testing kits and provides an appropriately cautious tone regarding the evidence surrounding a particular gene and its association with athleticism.  </span></span>"," A recent commentary published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) calls attention to the potential harms associated with testing children for genes associated with sports performance. 
What differentiates the results reported in this study of genes associated with athletic performance from other association studies appears to be the lack of strong evidence supporting this association with athletic performance. This means that unlike certain genes that really have been associated with, say heart disease, at the level of a population, the jury is still out on the evidence for genes associated with athletic performance. So if we’re not sure at the population level, it means that this test is of no practical value for any individual (or as this article mentions – the hopeful parent of an indifferent child) who wishes to predict the future likelihood of being a professional athlete.

Two studies will be published back-to-back in the December issue of Journal of Nuclear Medicine--one as featured article of the month--describing testing of three candidate molecules in patients with Alzheimer\'s disease, as well as the use of one molecule to measure the accumulation of tau proteins.\n\n""One of the greatest public health challenges is Alzheimer\'s disease, for which there currently is no cure and no definitive diagnostic until autopsy,"" says Dean Wong, M.D., Ph.D., professor of radiology and radiological sciences, psychiatry and behavioral sciences, neurology and neuroscience, and director of the Section of High Resolution Brain PET Imaging, Division of Nuclear Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""We have been working hard to identify new radiopharmaceuticals that can help speed the discoveries of diagnostics and treatments for these devastating neurodegenerative disorders.""\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is characterized in the brain by the appearance of two abnormal protein structures: amyloid plaques and tangled fibers made up of a protein called tau. One of the biggest challenges in studying Alzheimer\'s disease thus far, according to Wong, is the inability to watch these so-called neurofibrillary tangles develop in real time.\n\nAs part of a longer term project funded by F. Hoffman-La Roche, the team previously tested a collection of approximately 550 potential tracer molecules and identified six promising tracers, eventually narrowing them down to three to be made and tested as candidate Tau PET radiopharmaceuticals. These three most promising tracers were previously tested in nonhuman primates, and the results looked promising enough to test in people.\n\nThe researchers recruited a total of 12 patients with Alzheimer\'s disease, seven younger healthy controls (ages 25-38 years old) and five older healthy controls (age 50 or older) for brain-only PET scans. An additional six older healthy controls were recruited for full-body scanning. The study was divided into three parts. In the first part, each person was injected with two of the three randomly designated tracers (on separate visits) prior to receiving a brain PET scan with subsequent evaluation to determine which molecule performed best. In the second part of the study, researchers tested the optimal tracer, called F-18 RO948, with additional brain imaging in five patients with Alzheimer\'s and five older controls, with follow-up of previously seen patients to evaluate the potential progression of tau protein tangling after an average span of approximately 16 months.\n\nThe third part of the study examined six older controls undergoing whole-body scanning. In total, the researchers looked at 80 different regions in the brain to evaluate how well the tracers were taken up by the brain, how well they penetrated through the tissue and how specifically they bound to the tau protein rather than just sticking indiscriminately to anything. Regions of the brain that typically contain accumulated tau protein include the temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital lobe, among others; grey matter in the cerebellum is thought to contain low or no tau in patients with Alzheimer\'s. They found that healthy brains retained little to no tracer, whereas the brains of those with Alzheimer\'s showed tau to be in regions of the brain consistent with previously reported postmortem data on filamentous tangles.\n\nIn the second paper, the team examined the detailed quantification of tau binding via F-18 RO948 in 11 patients with Alzheimer\'s disease, five young cognitively normal controls and five older cognitively normal controls. They verified that detailed quantification of the tested and retested tracer in those five patients with Alzheimer\'s and five older controls generated good and reproducible results. According to Wong, this body of work reveals that, as compared with the currently used Tau tracer, F-18 AV1451, the new tracer, F-18 RO948, does not bind randomly to other tissue, offering greater clarity into quantification of potential tau burden within the human brain.\n\n""It really takes a village to make progress in biomedical research, and this project was no exception, with the involvement of the PET team at Hopkins, a CRO who helped recruit healthy subjects, colleagues in psychiatry and behavioral sciences, colleagues at the National Institute of Aging and neuroscience imaging experts at Roche,"" says Wong. ""This is a true example of cross-disciplinary collaboration, and I\'m honored to have such great collaborators.""\n\n###\n\nThis study was made available online in May 2018 ahead of peer-review and publication. It was published in the December 2018 issue of the journal.\n\nAuthors of the first Journal of Nuclear Medicine featured paper ""Characterization of 3 Novel Tau Radiopharmaceuticals, 11C-RO-963, 11C-RO-643, and 18F-RO-948, in Healthy Controls and in Alzheimer Subjects"" include Dean F.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. contract to The Johns Hopkins University. Susan Resnick and Madhav Thambisetty are employees of the NIH, National Institute on Aging.\n\nThe authors report no other relevant potential conflict of interest.']","This news release did a good job of explaining how the study was done but didn’t provide data on benefits, costs, or harms.","The release focuses on two papers that discuss early research into developing a technique for identifying people who will develop neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. The papers were published in the December issue of the Journal of Nuclear Medicine.
Specifically, the papers evaluated “tracer” molecules that might be useful for identifying “tau tangles” — proteins in the brain that occur in patients with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.
The release does a good job of describing the research, but does not address costs, potential harms, or the potential accuracy of diagnostic tests that might be developed based on these tracer molecules. Also, we think the headline jumps the gun in calling this a “promising diagnostic tool.”

But each shot costs as much as $1,000, and because the drug has a limited track record, experts do not agree on how well it works.\n\nProponents say Vivitrol could save money compared with the cost of locking up a drug offender — about $25,000 a year for each inmate at the Sheridan Correctional Center, 70 miles southwest of Chicago.\n\nNew drug offered to addicted inmates combats opioid epidemic\n\nDr. Joshua Lee, of New York University’s medical school, said more evidence is needed to determine whether the medication can help substantial numbers of people and whether it’s worth paying for, but the early results are encouraging.\n\n“It sounds good, and for some of us, it feels like the right thing to do,” said Lee, a leading researcher on the treatment.\n\nVivitrol is emerging as the nation searches for ways to ease an opioid epidemic that affects more than 2 million Americans and an estimated 15 percent of the U.S. prison population. Many experts view prisons — where addiction’s human toll can be seen most clearly — as a natural place to discover what works.\n\nChristopher Wolf had already served prison time for nonviolent crimes when he was ordered into treatment for a heroin addiction by a judge who suggested Vivitrol. Three months later, the 36-year-old from Centerville, Ohio, is clean and working full time as a cook.\n\nHe now suggests the medication to other addicts.\n\n“I don’t have cravings,” Wolf said. “I see how much better life is. It gets better really fast.”\n\nVivitrol targets receptors in the brain’s reward system, blocking the high and extinguishing urges. In some programs, prisoners get an injection before release, then follow-up shots from any clinic.\n\nFor decades, researchers have recognized addiction as a relapsing brain disease with medication an important part of therapy. But most jails and prisons reject methadone and buprenorphine, the other government-approved medications for opioid addiction, because they are habit-forming and can be abused.\n\nJust ask Joshua Meador, 28, an inmate at Sheridan who hopes to get into the Vivitrol program before his release in January. Before incarceration, he abused both older treatment drugs. When given take-home doses of methadone for the weekend, he would sell them for heroin.\n\n“When I’m on Vivitrol, I can’t get high,” he said. The drug has no street value or abuse potential.\n\n“You couldn’t design something better for the criminal justice system,” said David Farabee of the University of California at Los Angeles, who leads a Vivitrol study in a New Mexico jail. “There’s been pushback with other medications, people saying, ‘We’re just changing one drug for another.’ That argument goes out the window when you’re talking about a blocker” like Vivitrol.\n\nPrison systems in Illinois, Vermont, Wyoming and Wisconsin are trying the drug on a small scale. Michigan is offering Vivitrol to parolees who commit small crimes, if addiction is the reason for their new offense. The federal Bureau of Prisons ran a field trial in Texas and plans to expand the program to the Northeast next year. The drug’s manufacturer hopes prisons will be the gateway to a larger market.\n\nAlso known as extended-release naltrexone, the medication won Food and Drug Administration approval for alcohol dependence in 2006 and in 2010 to prevent relapse in post-detox opioid users.\n\nThe evidence for giving Vivitrol to inmates is thin but promising.\n\nIn the biggest study, sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 300 offenders — most of them heroin users on probation or parole — were randomly assigned to receive either Vivitrol or brief counseling and referral to a treatment program.\n\nAfter six months, the Vivitrol group had a lower rate of relapse, 43 percent compared with 64 percent. A year after treatment stopped, there had been no overdoses in the Vivitrol group and seven overdoses, including three deaths, in the other group. The results, published in March in the New England Journal of Medicine, have been promoted by the drugmaker, Ireland-based Alkermes, as it markets Vivitrol to U.S. correctional systems.\n\nYet addiction is stubborn. When the injections stopped, many in the study relapsed. A year later, relapse rates looked the same in the two groups.\n\n“It does suggest six months wasn’t enough,” said Lee, the lead author.\n\nT.J. Voller was a Vivitrol success story — until he wasn’t. After Vivitrol was approved by the FDA, Voller talked about getting the shot with The Associated Press and Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN segment. The 30-year-old was back at work and seemed proud of his recovery. But after 10 months on Vivitrol, he died of a heroin overdose.\n\n“He was alone for the weekend and picked up that needle one last time,” said his mother, Kathi Voller of Raynham, Massachusetts.\n\nAdvocates argue that inmates have a constitutional right to all FDA-approved addiction medications throughout their incarceration.\n\n“Treatment should be offered from the moment they are brought into the system,” said Sally Friedman, legal director of the New York-based Legal Action Center, which is looking for a test case to bring to court.\n\nPhysicians have learned to be cautious about pharmaceutical company marketing, said Andrew Kolodny, senior scientist at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University.\n\nNot so for criminal justice officials, who may be too trusting, Kolodny said.\n\n“When the drug company sends someone in to give them a talk and buy them pizza, they think they’re getting a scientific lecture,” he said.\n\nAlkermes spokeswoman Jennifer Snyder said the company’s sales team helps educate corrections staff and community care providers only after they have shown interest in Vivitrol.\n\nThere’s widespread agreement that counseling, support groups and treatment for underlying problems such as depression are crucial for Vivitrol patients, said Dr. Joseph Garbely of Pennsylvania-based Caron Treatment Centers, which supports medication-assisted treatment and prefers Vivitrol.\n\n“The disease of addiction is a cunning, baffling and powerful one,” Garbely said. “And you need all hands on deck.”']",This story’s focus on cautionary aspects of the drug’s use and marketing does a nice job of illuminating the complexity of drug introductions.,"
Extended-release naltrexone, which blocks the effects of opioid use, is being increasingly used by prisons in an effort to help prisoners with opioid use disorder stay off drugs once they have been released.
This story tracks that experimental use of the drug, marketed as Vivitrol by the Ireland-based pharmaceutical company Alkermes, and reflects the hope on the part of both prison officials and inmates that the drug will prove effective. However, the story also emphasizes that research on the drug’s effectiveness among prisoners has been scant, the cost of injections is high, and the company appears to be actively marketing the drug to prisons where, according to one source, an insufficient level of wariness about marketing tactics may enhance gullibility. One could argue that the preliminary nature of these efforts to test Vivitrol in a prison environment should lead journalists to delay stories until more evidence is in hand. But this story’s focus on cautionary aspects of the drug’s use and marketing does a nice job of illuminating the complexity of drug introductions.

But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests.\n\nA spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia.\n\n""Nocturia is very common in patients over 50 years old, and can cause significant problems by causing loss of sleep, and injury due to falls,"" said study lead author Dr. Jed Kaminetsky.\n\nThe millions of people with nocturia wake up two or more times a night to urinate. Besides an enlarged prostate, Kaminetsky said, common causes are bladder problems, poor circulation and obesity.\n\nKaminetsky is a clinical assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.\n\nIn the United States there\'s no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said.\n\nThe new drug, while promising, is of concern because of its potential to lower blood sodium levels in the elderly, one doctor said. Meanwhile, another researcher suggested that exercise might help stave off nocturia.\n\nKnown as SER-120, the nasal spray contains desmopressin, a low-dose synthetic version of the naturally occurring hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin, an anti-diuretic, reduces urine production.\n\nSER-120 appears to delay urine production for four to six hours during sleep, said Kaminetsky, ""and wears off by morning when patients awaken and start to drink fluids.""\n\nHe is scheduled to present his team\'s research Sunday in San Diego at a meeting of the American Urological Association. The research was funded by the spray\'s manufacturer, Serenity Pharmaceuticals.\n\nDesmopressin is commonly used to treat bed-wetting among children ages 6 and up, the study authors pointed out.\n\nTo assess its potential in adults, the study team enlisted nearly 1,400 men and women, 50 and older, who had a history of nocturia.\n\nFor three months, participants were randomly assigned to use either the desmopressin spray (two doses were tried) or a non-medicinal spray (a placebo).\n\nPatients kept three-day urination diaries, and filled out quality-of-life questionnaires.\n\nDesmopressin spray prompted ""a significant decrease"" in the frequency of nightly bathroom trips compared with the untreated group, Kaminetsky said. On average, patients reported at least two fewer episodes a night.\n\nThe treatment group also experienced a ""significant increase"" in the length of time they could sleep before awakening to urinate. That uninterrupted sleep period extended to more than four hours, Kaminetsky said.\n\nThe researchers also found that those in the higher-dose spray group experienced a ""significant improvement"" in overall quality of life, compared with the untreated group.\n\nThough SER-120 is still considered investigational, Kaminetsky said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the findings, with a possible decision late this year.\n\nDr. Tomas Griebling, a professor of urology at the University of Kansas, described the study results as ""promising,"" but added a note of caution.\n\n""Other researchers have examined the utility and safety of desmopressin for the treatment of nocturia in the past,"" he said. ""However, there have been concerns about safety, particularly in elderly patients.""\n\nGriebling said the American Geriatrics Society includes desmopressin in the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, primarily because of concerns about resulting low blood sodium levels.\n\nBut the lower doses used in this study (1.5 or 0.75 mcg) ""may help to improve the overall safety profile, particularly for geriatric patients,"" he said. ""Additional research will be needed to fully answer this question in the future.""\n\nThe study team said two of the higher-dose patients developed significantly low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) as did one person taking the placebo.\n\nDr. Julien Dagenais, a urologist at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston, explored nocturia from another angle. He analyzed physical activity data reported by more than 10,000 men and women (aged 20 and older) in a U.S. health and nutrition survey conducted between 2005 and 2010.\n\nPeople who reported higher levels of exercise were less likely to suffer from nocturia, Dagenais found. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.\n\nThese findings will also be presented at the American Urological Association meeting. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThere\'s more on nocturia at the National Association for Continence.']","This story carefully pointed out the known harms of the intervention, but could have been more specific on costs and alternatives.","This story is about a proposed new drug for nocturia, which is defined as having to urinate two or more times during a normal night of sleep. The story also briefly mentions another study linking increased physical activity with a smaller number of people suffering from nocturia.
The story included commentary from an independent source and discussed potential harms of the drug, which is good. And we’re told early on that the information about the study will be used a a presentation at a conference, making it preliminary. We also appreciated that the study’s funder was disclosed.
But the story didn’t mention potential pricing for this new drug, and it didn’t compare the drug against currently available treatments for this condition.

It also appeared to prevent colds in people who used it over the course of about five months.\n\n“This is great news,” says Kay Dickersin, PhD, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and director of the U.S. Cochrane Center. “We really don’t have interventions for colds that work.”\n\nThe review of 15 studies with 1,360 participants was published by the Cochrane group, an international collaboration of researchers that reviews evidence behind therapeutic interventions.

We think it did a nice job explaining the science behind zinc’s effect on colds, and it provided some good details about the possible harms associated with taking zinc.
But Reuters took a much more cautious approach – and appropriately so – with a headline that “Zinc will help your cold, at least a little”.  And the opening sentences:  “may take the edge off the common cold. But not a whole lot.”

SHP465 (triple-bead mixed amphetamine salts - MAS) is an investigational oral stimulant medication being evaluated in the U.S. as a potential treatment for ADHD, a therapeutic area with significant need for additional treatment options.\n\nThe primary efficacy analysis of study 305 demonstrated that SHP465, administered as a daily morning dose, was superior to placebo on the change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV (ADHD rating scale) total score, with a Least Squares (LS) mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -9.9 (95% CI: -13.0 to -6.8, p<0.001), suggesting a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms. SHP465 was also superior to placebo in the key secondary efficacy analysis on the clinical global impression improvement scale (CGI-I), with an LS mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -0.8 (95% CI: -1.1 to -0.5, p<0.001), indicating a significantly higher proportion of patients were rated improved on the CGI-I rating scale. The CGI-I is a standardized assessment tool that allows clinicians to rate the severity of ADHD illness, change over time and efficacy of medication.\n\nTreatment-emergent adverse events ≥ 5% for SHP 465-305 were decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, irritability, nausea, weight decrease and dizziness. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and similar to those observed in previous SHP465 studies and with other amphetamine compounds.\n\nThe completion of SHP465-305 addresses an FDA requirement to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHP465 in children and adolescents prior to filing a Class 2 resubmission of the medicine for FDA approval.\n\n""We are pleased with the positive results of the SHP465-305 study,"" said Philip J. Vickers, Ph.D., Head of Research & Development, Shire. ""These results represent an important step toward a new treatment option for patients with ADHD. Shire looks forward to including these data as part of the FDA resubmission and is eager to continue advancing this clinical program.""\n\nDr. Matthew Brams, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor at Baylor College of Medicine and principal investigator for study 305, added: ""The study of SHP465 in children and adolescents is an essential next step to progressing the clinical program. I\'m excited about these positive data from SHP465-305 because of the benefit that this potential new treatment option may provide for patients with ADHD.""\n\nOverall Robust SHP465 Clinical Development Program to Support Class 2 Resubmission\n\nIncluding study 305 and previous studies, Shire now has a robust database of 15 clinical studies evaluating SHP465 in more than 1,100 subjects. Once the pharmacokinetic study and an additional safety and efficacy Phase 3 trial in adults currently under way are complete later this year, Shire plans to add these study results to its existing SHP465 data set to submit a Class 2 resubmission for FDA approval of the medicine for treatment of ADHD. SHP465 remains on track for potential U.S. launch in the second half of 2017.\n\nIn previous adolescent and adult clinical studies, SHP465 demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo at 16 hours post dosing, with onset of action starting 4 hours post dosing, as measured by the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP). PERMP was not measured in the SHP465-305 study.\n\nProtection for Shire\'s ADHD Franchise Extends to 2029\n\nThere are patents supporting Shire\'s overall ADHD franchise in the U.S. that extend to 2029. With a launch planned for the second half of 2017, Shire expects that SHP465, following potential FDA approval, will have three years of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity and at least three patents listed in the FDA Orange Book expiring as late as May 2029.\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nShire enables people with life-altering conditions to lead better lives.\n\nOur strategy is to focus on developing and marketing innovative specialty medicines to meet significant unmet patient needs.\n\nWe focus on providing treatments in Rare Diseases, Neuroscience, Gastrointestinal and Internal Medicine and we are developing treatments for symptomatic conditions treated by specialist physicians in other targeted therapeutic areas, such as Ophthalmics.\n\nhttp://www.shire.com\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nStatements included herein that are not historical facts, including without limitation statements concerning our announced business combination with Baxalta and the timing and financial and strategic benefits thereof, our 20x20 ambition that targets $20 billion in combined product sales by 2020, as well as other targets for future financial results, capital structure, performance and sustainability of the combined company, the combined company\'s future strategy, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the anticipated timing of clinical trials and approvals for, and the commercial potential of, inline or pipeline products are forward-looking statements.

Shire’s release aimed at investors and financial reporters is the latest example.,"This news release announces the results of a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of a long-acting stimulant drug for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. The pharmaceutical company Shire completed this follow-up trial on the drug’s safety and efficacy after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required more data when Shire first sought approval for the drug.
The drug was tested in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years old with ADHD. The company claims that the drug showed significant improvement in both children and adolescents when compared with a placebo and on the clinical global impression improvement scale, a standardized measurement of improvement.
While the release is clearly targeted to investors and financial reporters, it was distributed and made available to a wide public audience. Just because a release is written for a business audience does not mean it should skimp on transparency. Its biggest weakness is the strong claims it makes without providing any links or references to published research where the results can be evaluated. We perused the company’s website for details of the study but came up empty-handed. The news release doesn’t mention the lead investigator’s financial relationship with the drug sponsor, projected costs of the new drug, nor make any comparisons with numerous similar drugs already on the market.

Called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the lung ailment has forced 54-year-old Calick to use steroids and a rescue inhaler daily.\n\n“You can’t get up and walk 10 or 15 feet to go to the bathroom without wheezing,” Calick, of West Hempstead, New York, told FoxNews.com.\n\nCalick’s medications helped manage COPD, but anytime she stopped taking them, her symptoms would return.\n\nAs Calick ran out of options, she sought help from Dr. David Borenstein in New York City. Borenstein, an integrative medicine physician, is one of numerous doctors in the world who is using stem cell therapy to treat various diseases.\n\nStem cells, which can self-renew and replace damaged areas of the body, have been used in the treatment of orthopedic, cardio, autoimmune, neurological— and pulmonary disorders, like Calick’s.\n\nFor the procedure, Borenstein draws fat cells from the patient’s buttocks or midsection during liposuction, and then separates the stem cells in a centrifuge. Next, stem cells are mixed in a solution, which is administered through an IV and put into a nebulizer, from which the patient inhales them.\n\n""The ideal candidate for this procedure is someone with an early-stage [form of] COPD, so we can halt the progression of the disease,” Borenstein told FoxNews.com.\n\nBorenstein said about two-thirds of his patients see COPD relief within several weeks to about five months, and that those results last for about a year.\n\nAlthough Borenstein’s stem cell treatments for COPD isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or covered by health insurance, Calick said the procedure— which costs less than $8,000— was well worth the price.\n\n""I could walk further, I\'m not wheezing , I could go out with different friends, stand for long periods of time, walk places,” Calick said of her condition after the stem cell therapy. “[If] someone says, ‘Oh, you\'re using the elevator,’ [I say], ‘No, I’m using the stairs!”\n\nFor more information on stem cell therapy for COPD treatment, visit David Borenstein’s website.']",Vague language and anecdotal claims amount to advertising for an unproven treatment.,"We were thrilled to see this story mention the costs of the treatment, its lack of FDA approval, and the fact that insurance won’t cover it. But that was just one sentence. The rest of the story is so heavily focused on the experiences of one patient who believes she was successfully treated through stem cells that readers would understandably be driven to dial up this doctor based on scant evidence, no real understanding of the potential benefits, no independent assessment of the treatment, no comparison to alternatives, and no mention of risks.

While the drug is not being hailed as a cure for peanut allergy, it has proven successful in building up patients’ tolerance to peanuts over time, lessening the potential for life-threatening complications.\n\n“We’re excited about the potential to help children and adolescents with peanut allergy protect themselves against accidentally eating a food with peanut in it,” said allergist Stephen Tilles, MD, ACAAI former president, study co-author and consulting advisor for Aimmune Therapeutics, according to EurekAlert. “Our hope when we started the study was that by treating patients with the equivalent of one peanut per day, many would tolerate as much as two peanuts. We were pleased to find that two thirds of people in the study were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts per day after nine to 12 months of treatment, and half the patients tolerated the equivalent of four peanuts.”\n\nFDA WARNS AGAINST HONEY PACIFIERS AFTER TEXAS INFANTS HOSPITALIZED WITH 'RARE' ILLNESS\n\nThe results, which were presented Sunday at the College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were based on study participants ranging in age from 4 to 55 years old. All participants, who mostly fell between ages 4 and 17, had a peanut allergy, but one third received a placebo while the rest were given a peanut protein powder that increased in dose over time.\n\nParticipants ingested the peanut protein under the supervision of a board-certified allergist as part of a process called an oral food challenge (OFC).\n\n“Reactions from the oral challenges at the end of the study were much milder than prior to treatment,” Tilles said, according to EurekAlert. “On average, the participants were able to tolerate a 100-fold higher dose of peanut at the end of the study than they did at the beginning. In addition, the symptoms caused by the 100-fold higher dose at the end of the study were milder than the symptoms on the lower dose at the beginning of the study.”\n\nEXPERTS: CHILDREN AT RISK OF LEAD POISONING IN CHATTANOOGA\n\nWith FDA approval this drug would mark the first treatment available by prescription for peanut allergies. The study’s authors noted that patients would need to stay on the drug in order to receive protection against the allergy.\n\n“This is not a quick fix, and it doesn’t mean people with peanut allergy will be able to eat peanuts whenever they want,” Jay Lieberman, MD, vice chair of the ACAAI Food Allergy Committee and study co-author, said, according to EurekAlert. “But it is definitely a breakthrough. The hope would be to have a treatment available in the second half of 2019. If that happens, people who receive and are able to tolerate this treatment should be protected from accidental exposures.""]",Harms and costs aren’t addressed.,"This Fox News story describes a new treatment for kids with peanut allergy called AR101, which could help protect against severe reactions to peanut ingestion. It’s one of two stories we reviewed about this important and newsworthy study. The other was from CNN.
This story does not appear to contain original reporting. Instead it relies on a news release, including multiple quotes from the study authors, one using the unfortunate word “breakthrough.” Significantly, it doesn’t address costs or harms.

One group of 105 patients was offered a three-month regimen of self-care advice on diet, exercise and psychological support.\n\nThe second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of ""traditional"" acupuncture.\n\nAll of the participants kept hot flash diaries. At the end of the three-month period (and for up to six months thereafter) daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency.\n\nThe result: by the end of the treatment period, those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were 50 percent lower than those in the non-acupuncture group. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended.\n\nThose in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health, with no serious side effects, the study authors said.\n\nSo why does acupuncture seem to work?\n\nRazzini cited several reasons, including acupuncture\'s ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient\'s nervous system, while stimulating the release of endorphins -- a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion. It also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine, as well as the mood regulator serotonin.\n\nRazzini didn\'t know how much American patients might have to pay for such treatment, but added, ""Compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants, (acupuncture) should be less expensive, and, for sure, more safe and feasible.""\n\nDr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look.\n\n""Anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice, because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti-hormonal treatment can be profound,"" she said.\n\n""Almost all women experience them. For some it\'s a moderate situation, but for others it\'s a really significant problem. Some women -- I would say probably about 15 percent -- have such severe hot flashes that they even refuse to take medications that can cut their risk for cancer or cancer recurrence by 50 percent, simply because they can\'t handle the hot flashes,"" Vito explained.\n\n""And I\'ve actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I\'m not surprised by the finding,"" she added. ""But it is heartening that we now have scientific proof that this can work. Which, in the end, may help to encourage insurance companies to their expand coverage so this can become an affordable option for all patients in need.""\n\nMore information\n\nThere\'s more on cancer and hot flashes at the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']","When previous research exists, it’s important to place the new work in context. How is the new work different? This HealthDay story about a study looking at treating hot flashes with acupuncture for breast cancer patients didn’t fill in readers on older research.","The story focuses on a recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology that finds female breast cancer patients who use acupuncture therapy in conjunction with “enhanced self-care” had fewer problems with hot flashes than patients who used only enhanced self-care.
The story does a good job of explaining the study’s design, and includes an independent source. However, it fell short when quantifying the benefits, and it did not discuss potential harms or the already existing body of work related to acupuncture’s use to ameliorate hot flashes in breast cancer patients.

But the influence of cognitive decline on how sexuality is perceived in later life wasn’t known, researchers said.\n\nThe study, conducted in the Netherlands, involved 1,747 men and women from a larger study of aging. The subjects were 71 years old, on average. About three-quarters had partners. Researchers assessed cognitive function with tests of memory, mental processing speed, general cognitive function and fluid intelligence, or the ability to reason and think abstractly.\n\nSubjects responded to four questions about the importance of sexuality personally and to older people generally, and about their current sex life and need for intimacy and touching with aging. Chronic diseases, depression and medications were recorded.\n\nA quarter of the subjects rated their current or personal sexuality as important or very important, while 41% rated it as unimportant. Nearly 28% agreed that sexuality at an older age isn’t important anymore; 42% felt it was important.\n\nCurrent sexual activity was considered pleasant and unpleasant by 32% and 6%, respectively, but 67% believed intimacy and touching are still needed in older people, while 12% didn’t agree.\n\nSubjects who didn’t see the importance of sexual behavior or a need for intimacy, and who considered their current sexuality unimportant and their sex life unpleasant, had lower average cognitive scores compared with those who felt sexuality was important and were satisfied with their current sexual activity. The association between lower cognitive functioning and the belief that sexuality was unimportant was significant in both sexes, but seemed stronger in women, researchers said.\n\nCaveat: The study didn't include subjects with severe cognitive impairment. Causal relation between sexuality and cognitive function couldn’t be determined.\n\nThe Perception of Sexuality in Older Adults and Its Relationship with Cognitive Functioning\n\nRunning injuries: Regular shoe changes—and playing different sports—may reduce the risk of injury in recreational runners, suggests a study in the current issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports.\n\nRunning involves the repetition of a large number of almost identical movements with very few variations, which can lead to overuse injuries, researchers said. Alternating shoes and sports may help to vary the musculoskeletal load, the study suggests.\n\nIn 2012, researchers in Luxembourg recruited 264 recreational runners, 69 women and 195 men in their early 40s, for the 22-week study. More than half, 56%, alternated approximately four pairs of running shoes of different makes or models, on average, while 44% mostly wore the same pair.\n\nThe subjects used an electronic database to record their weekly running and other sports activities, including the type of activity, duration, intensity, distance and shoe use. Pain in the lower back or legs that developed during exercise and prevented normal activity was recorded, along with the day the sport was resumed.\n\nA third of participants reported at least one running-related injury during the study. Most of the injuries affected muscles and tendons and 36% lasted up to a month or longer.\n\nRunners who wore more than one pair of shoes had a 39% lower risk of injury than those who wore the same pair during almost all running sessions, the adjusted results showed. Multiple shoe users wore the main pair 58% of the time during the study period, while other runners wore the same shoes 91% of the time.\n\nRunners with multiple shoes participated in other sports for close to two hours a week, about twice the amount of time spent by single-shoe runners, and were more regular in their training and experienced in competitions.\n\nCaveat: The study was relatively short, which may have limited the number of reported injuries, researchers said.\n\nCan parallel use of different running shoes decrease running-related injury risk?\n\nResponse shift: People treated for chronic hand eczema may take a rosier view of the disease after it improves, playing down the severity of their worst outbreak, a study found. This change in perception, called a response shift, could adversely affect the behaviors patients use to manage the disease, according to a report in the March issue of Contact Dermatitis.\n\nA response shift is particularly important in clinical studies, as it may result in flawed reporting of treatment effects, the study said. Taking regular photographs of skin areas affected by eczema could help counteract a response shift by patients, researchers suggest.\n\nEczema affects an estimated 10.2% of U.S. adults, according to the National Eczema Association, a nonprofit research organization. Hand eczema is a fluctuating disease that has been shown to seriously affect patients’ quality of life, the study said.\n\nResearchers in Denmark recruited 224 patients with hand eczema, 145 women and 79 men ages 18 to 70. Quality of life and eczema severity were assessed with two questionnaires six months apart. Subjects rated the severity of their current eczema and their worst outbreak on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (extremely bad) at both time points.\n\nClose to two-thirds, 61.2%, rated their current eczema lower on the second assessment, at 3.5, on average, compared with 4.7 on the first assessment, indicating an improvement, researchers said. Eczema was unchanged or worse in 38.8%. But 49.1% of subjects rated their worst-ever eczema outbreak at 8, on average, at the second assessment and 8.5 on the first, a statistically significant change that indicated a response shift, researchers said.\n\nCaveat: The six-month follow-up period was relatively short, researchers said.\n\nResponse shift in severity assessment of hand eczema with visual analogue scales""]",The provocative headline for this story might have things backwards.,"This story was about an observational study suggesting a link between sexual activity/fulfillment and better cognitive function in older people. A story that did more than scratch the surface of this study would have uncovered an obvious limitation: Older people sometimes aren’t healthy enough to have good (or any) sex, and seniors who aren’t healthy enough for sex probably also have brains that are less healthy than their sexually fulfilled peers. So suggesting that sex “leads to a sharper mind” is an oversimplification of what’s going on here.

They\'re rich in fiber, folic acid, and potassium. Walnuts are especially heart healthy because they have more polyunsaturated fat than almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans, pistachios, and macadamia nuts per serving. Walnut oil can be a good alternative too, in dressings and for light basting, Politi said.\n\nIt\'s still important to remember portion control, especially for people on weight loss programs, warned Politi.\n\n""Try a serving in a snack bag.

But within 40 minutes of receiving a ketamine injection, their depressive symptoms improved; the effect persisted for at least three days.\n\nRight now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study.\n\nAnd as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide. “We want to alleviate the suffering and get them back to their life,” he said.\n\nZarate and his colleagues had previously demonstrated that ketamine shots helped some patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression, meaning they did not cycle through manic episodes. In the new study, they gave patients with bipolar illness ketamine or a placebo on two test days two weeks apart.\n\nAll of the patients were on lithium or valproate - two drugs commonly used for bipolar illness - but had not responded to treatment. Nearly all were unemployed, Zarate and his team note, and two-thirds were on psychiatric disability.\n\nCompared to placebo, patients showed significant improvement in mood within 40 minutes of receiving the ketamine infusion, using a common depression rating scale. Symptom improvement peaked two days after the injection, but remained significantly greater than for placebo for three days.\n\nSeventy-one percent of the patients responded to ketamine, meaning they had at least a 50 percent improvement in their depressive symptoms. Six percent responded to placebo.\n\nSide effects included anxiety, “feeling woozy or loopy,” headache, and dissociative symptoms, meaning a temporary sense of disconnection from reality, although there were no serious adverse events. By developing more specifically targeted drugs, Zarate noted, it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms.\n\nKetamine appears to work by “resetting” the way nerve cells process glutamate, a brain chemical key for learning, memory, and other functions, according to Zarate. The problem in bipolar illness and depression, he explains, doesn’t appear to be that a person has too much or too little glutamate; instead, it’s likely that the way their neurons release and take up the chemical is out of whack.\n\nFirst introduced in 1962, ketamine is used legally in both human and veterinary medicine as an anesthetic. It’s also a drug of abuse, at much higher doses than those used in Zarate’s research; while patients in the current study received about 50 milligrams during a 40-minute period, a dose too low to induce anesthesia, recreational users of ketamine, known as “Special K,” may take hundreds of milligrams per week.\n\nIn 1999, US regulators classified ketamine as a Schedule III controlled substance, meaning it has the potential for abuse but is also useful medically.\n\nKetamine could improve treatment of bipolar illness and depression in a variety of ways, Zarate said; for example, as a means to jump-start standard drug treatment, or as an anesthetic before ECT. “It’s opened the floodgate of many different directions of research, and all of them are quite encouraging,” said Zarate, who along with a co-author has filed for a patent on the use of ketamine in depression. Those rights would be assigned to his employer, the National Institutes of Health.\n\nEfforts are already underway in Europe to develop guidelines for how ketamine should be used and prescribed to treat bipolar illness and depression, the researcher said.\n\nIn the US, research is continuing on the drug, he added, and some physicians are likely trying the drug in their patients with bipolar illness or depression who aren’t helped by standard treatments. But, according to Zarate, more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most effective way.\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/wek23n Archives of General Psychiatry, August 2010.']","Granted, this was a story about a difficult-to-treat condition.  But there just weren’t enough caveats about the limitatons of an 18-person study.  The very last line needed to be far higher in the story: ""more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most  effective way.""  ","Instead, the headline leaps with optimism about lifting mood quickly. The story quoted no outside sources, gave no cost information, no uncritical evaluation of the evidence, offered limited comparison with alternative therapies, and limited discussion of the potentially harmful effects of putting a sizeable percentage of the population struggling with depression onto a highly addictive narcotic.

But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone.\n\nRadiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients. Using positron emission tomography -- also known as a PET scan -- doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread.\n\nIn studies involving mice with prostate cancer, the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the same prostate cancer marker used in the PSA test. They found that the PSA gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormone-based therapies.\n\nThe study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone. The researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Saturday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in Chicago, and are also being published in Cancer Discovery.\n\nIf used on people, the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors ""personalize"" treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease.\n\n""The ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage, thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes,"" Michael J. Evans, research fellow in the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, explained in meeting news release.\n\nEncouraged by their findings, the study\'s authors said they hope to begin a human trial next year.\n\nTwo prostate cancer experts said the tool, if borne out in patients, could prove very useful.\n\nDr. Michael Schwartz is director of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery at North Shore-LIJ Health System in Lake Success, N.Y. He noted that, as of now, doctors typically rely on results of the PSA blood test and/or standard diagnostic scans to help guide treatment decisions.\n\nBoth methods have their limits and, ""while this study is very preliminary, if this radiotracer technology can prove to detect very early recurrence or metastasis in human patients, it could become extremely useful in either the pre- or post-treatment setting in selecting a treatment algorithm,"" Schwartz said. ""It also may help reduce the need for biopsy of possible metastatic lesions.""\n\nDr. Erik Goluboff, an attending urologist at Beth Israel Medical Center, New York City, agreed that, ""this is an exciting study using a novel radiotracer to detect PSA-expressing tissues throughout the body.""\n\nHe believes that the new tool\'s ""greatest strength would be in monitoring changes in PSA expression in tissues as a result of various treatments. If a treatment showed a marked change, it could continue to be used in that patient, hence ""personalized"" medicine. If a specific change did not occur, that treatment could be abandoned and another tried instead. Since these changes could not be detected based on a PSA blood test alone, this new test would be very helpful in determining early on which therapy to choose in a given patient.""\n\nHowever, Goluboff also noted that research from animal-based studies does not always pan out in humans and ""further, larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute provides more information on prostate cancer.']",Why is it so important to report on mouse research that a news organization is compelled to write the mouse story before a talk is even presented at a scientific conference?,"The story conveyed a cheerleading tone throughout, starting with the the story’s opening words – “A noninvasive scan…”  Non-invasive is usually an attribute of scanning technologies.
The true leap from mouse research to human application was only hinted at.

The study also noted that the device provides a helpful guide for post-treatment mammograms and other long-term follow-up to check for any cancer recurrence in these patients.\n\nA second study, presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2016 annual conference, describes the extra utility that BioZorb can provide, by significantly reducing the amount of normal breast and surrounding tissues that are exposed to radiation treatment.\n\nThe World Journal of Surgery article, by lead author breast surgeon Michael J. Cross, concluded that the 3-D marker is an ""effective method for delineating the tumor bed with a significant utility for RT (radiation therapy) planning.""\n\nIn the course of this three-year study, Dr. Cross and colleagues also documented a favorable shift toward use of hypo-fractionated radiation treatment, a shorter form of radiation associated with a substantial reduction in treatment costs.\n\n""Through our experience with this marker, we\'ve observed that its use results in less radiation dose to the patient compared to whole breast radiation, plus a better overall cosmetic outcome,"" said Dr. Cross, a nationally known breast surgeon at Breast Treatment Associates, in Fayetteville Ark. ""We were also pleased to note in our research that there were no device-related complications in this group of patients, and that none of them had a recurrence of cancer.""\n\nThe BioZorb device is placed during lumpectomy surgery, which removes the cancer and preserves the breast. It is the first and only device that identifies in a reliable way the 3-D region where the tumor was removed. It is particularly effective because by suturing the implant to the tumor bed, the surgeon can more precisely indicate to the radiation oncologist where the cancer was located. Dr. Cross notes that because of the marker\'s unique configuration, it can also assist with reconstructing the surgical region during the healing process.\n\nThe implantable marker consists of a framework made of a bioabsorbable material that holds six titanium clips. The framework slowly dissolves in the body over the course of a year or more. The tiny marker clips stay in place so the surgical site can be viewed for long-term monitoring such as mammograms.\n\nAs part of the research for the World Journal of Surgery study, 108 patients with early-stage breast cancer were prospectively implanted with the marker during ""reconstructive lumpectomy,"" a method of oncoplastic surgery to remove the cancer while reconstructing the remaining breast to improve cosmetic outcomes. The average age of women in the study was 63 years.\n\nThe authors concluded that the marker was helpful for several different types of physicians involved in the care of women with breast cancer: surgeons, radiation oncologists who plan and oversee radiation treatment, and radiologists who follow women after breast cancer treatment.\n\nThe article also noted that there was a shift during the three-year course of the study toward increasing use of hypo-fractionated radiation methods. These methods decrease the time it takes for patients to complete radiation treatment -- and are estimated to cut the cost of treatment by approximately 25%. The authors said use of the marker facilitated their shift toward these shorter courses of radiotherapy.\n\nUse of the marker allowed physicians to be more confident in their targeting and rely less on ""ambiguous planning targets such as the seroma and surrounding tissue changes."" Seroma is a collection of fluid that builds up in the area of tissue injury after surgery.\n\nWhile seromas have customarily been targeted for radiation treatment, they do not always reflect where the cancer was and can overestimate the size of the target areas in need of radiation. By more precisely marking the tumor bed, the article said, BioZorb can reduce the amount of healthy tissue that would otherwise receive unnecessary radiation.\n\nThe second recent study, presented at the 2016 annual ASTRO conference in Boston, described a collaborative approach between a radiation oncologist and breast surgeon. They studied the question of whether the marker could better identify the true lumpectomy cavity and thereby reduce the amount of tissue that is irradiated.\n\nThe authors – radiation oncologist William Hall, M.D., and breast surgeon Cary Kaufman, M.D. -- combined their analysis of 10 cases in which BioZorb was used.\n\nThey concluded that the tissue marker could significantly reduce radiation of healthy breast tissue (an average of 65% reduction), as well as avoid irradiating inadvertent seromas that are more common with oncoplastic procedures. By providing better targeting, they said, the marker could also play a role in facilitating the use of external beam partial breast irradiation.\n\n""The process of delivering radiation treatment is substantially streamlined by having the 3D marker in place,"" said Dr. Hall. ""The marker tells us where the tumor was and helps us determine appropriate forms of treatment, whether with partial breast irradiation or standard whole breast irradiation and a boost dose at the end of the treatment process.""\n\nDr. Hall is a radiation oncologist in the Department of Radiation Oncology at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center (Bellingham, Wash).

If the approach pans out, it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories.\n\nRight now, deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat Parkinson\'s disease and tremor, for which it\'s approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DBS involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes. The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano\'s work, dementia.\n\nIn 2008, Lozano\'s group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Though no bigger than a pea, the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control, sleep and circadian rhythms. It seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger. To the researcher\'s surprise, following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu. He also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends, including an old girlfriend. With increasing voltages, his memories became more vivid, including remembering their clothes.\n\nUsing a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano\'s group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. They found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus, a key cog in the brain\'s memory circuitry. As Alzheimer\'s progresses, not only does the hypothalamus atrophy, but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired.\n\nThat our memories — so entwined with our personalities and senses of self — might be so vulnerable to a brown out is, existentially speaking, rather alarming. There\'s something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons, and also about retrieving memories by hot-wiring the brain.\n\nYet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing. Given that Alzheimer\'s affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective, Lozano felt all but obligated to dig further. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010.\n\nThe study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year. ""The fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus,"" explains Lozano. ""It\'s easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function."" As expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate, however it appeared that in those with mild disease, cognitive decline slowed with stimulation.\n\nNext, Lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the US and Canada, all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain. In half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away. In the other half the stimulation wasn\'t turned on for a year, though they didn\'t know it.\n\nPreliminary results, published in December 2015 in the Journal of Neurosurgery, were mixed but encouraging.\n\nGiven that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. No serious long-term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group, supporting future research in the field.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, however, after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups, as measured by two scales commonly used to measure Alzheimer\'s disease symptoms, the ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB. Alzheimer\'s tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable. Lozano\'s final results won\'t be reported until four years out.\n\nMore intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization. Glucose is our brains\' primary fuel. The degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity. Patients with Alzheimer\'s typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains, as well as, again, shrinking memory circuits. The older patients in Lozano\'s study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain\'s memory regions. Not only that, the hippocampus of some study patients who received DBS actually increased in size.\n\nReversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in Alzheimer\'s research, and Lozano\'s finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that DBS in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus.\n\nLozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories, which he says has occurred in about one-third of his patents — requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on. Yet he\'s encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe. ""We also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain,"" he says, a finding that could mean there\'s a way to overcome some of the damage from Alzheimer\'s.\n\nEvidence supporting DBS in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that in seven patients receiving DBS to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex, spatial memory improved – meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks. The entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories.\n\nA group at the University of Cologne in Germany is instead focusing on delivering DBS to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to Alzheimer\'s. Last year they published a study in Molecular Psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to DBS, as measured by the ADAS-cog. Like in Lozano\'s study no serious side effects were seen.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence for DBS, not everyone is convinced.\n\nReferring to Lozano\'s second clinical study, Dr. Nader Pouratian, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at UCLA, comments, ""The recent deep brain stimulation trial for Alzheimer\'s disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease. Unfortunately, [the findings] suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed.""\n\nHowever he acknowledges Lozano\'s results suggest that DBS to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients, those being older people with less severe disease.\n\n""The most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area,"" he says. ""But I believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial.""\n\nIn a 2008 episode of the medical television drama House, the show\'s main character Dr. Gregory House survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky. In an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim – and inspired by Lozano\'s initial paper — House voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation. Following the procedure the grouchy TV doctor\'s memory returns. As is customary on the show, he cracks the case.\n\nDBS for treatment of Alzheimer\'s and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won\'t be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories. ""Even though House did this, we\'re not doing it yet,"" cautions Lozano.\n\nYet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections – albeit random ones – and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.\n\n""We\'re hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition,"" says Lozano. ""We want to turn these brain networks back on.""\n\nBret Stetka is a writer based in New York and an editorial director at Medscape. His work has appeared in Wired, Scientific American and on The Atlantic.com. He graduated from University of Virginia School of Medicine in 2005. He\'s also on Twitter: @BretStetka.']",The story would have benefited from a jolt of skepticism as it examines the challenge of applying a treatment that works for some diseases to an altogether different medical condition.,"This story describing research on deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat Alzheimer’s disease centers on a phase 2 safety trial that was the subject of a news release evaluated by HealthNewsReview.org in March.
The study involved a procedure in which an implanted neurostimulator delivered electrical signals to the fornix area of the brain to help regulate abnormal signals in patients with potential mild Alzheimer’s. A similar procedure is used to treat Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor.
The story provided some compelling details, but could have used a jolt of skepticism as it examined the challenge of applying a treatment that works for some diseases to an altogether different medical condition. Like the release, the story didn’t describe serious adverse effects of the treatment. The story also didn’t include costs and conflicts of interest.

He then lifted the small intestine out of the body to sift it through his fingers.\n\nAs he found tumors, he snipped them out. “You can see how this is coming off like wallpaper,” Dr. Lowy said as he stripped out part of the lining of the man’s abdominal cavity.\n\nAfter about two hours of poking and cutting, Dr. Lowy began the so-called shake and bake. The machine pumped heated chemotherapy directly into the abdominal cavity for 90 minutes while nurses gently jiggled the man’s bloated belly to disperse the drug to every nook and cranny.\n\nThe treatment is formally called cytoreductive surgery followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, or Hipec.\n\nRecent converts include University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx , and even Massachusetts General. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center is looking at it, according to people in the field. Advocates predict that the number of procedures could grow to 10,000 a year from about 1,500 now.\n\nThe therapy has even been featured on an episode of the TV series “Grey’s Anatomy.”\n\nBut Dr. Ryan, a gastrointestinal oncologist, suggested in an interview that the procedure was being extended to colorectal cancer because “you can’t make a living doing this procedure in appendix cancer patients.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe debated the procedure publicly at the recent annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. While some patients did seem to live much longer than expected, he said that they had been carefully selected and might have fared well even without the therapy.\n\nProponents say that if cancer has spread into the abdominal cavity but not elsewhere, then lives can be prolonged by removing all the visible tumor and killing what’s missed with Hipec.\n\nBy contrast, said Dr. Paul Sugarbaker, a surgeon at Washington Hospital Center and the leading proponent of Hipec, “there are no long-term survivors with systemic chemotherapy — zero.”\n\nDr. Sugarbaker, who opposed Dr. Ryan in the debate, said that it has long been known that cancerous cells are unable to withstand as much heat as healthy cells. And putting the chemotherapy on top of tumors should be more effective than systematically delivering it through the bloodstream.\n\nOne randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the Netherlands did show a striking benefit. The median survival of those getting surgery and Hipec, plus intravenous chemotherapy, was 22.3 months, almost double the 12.6 months for those getting only the intravenous chemotherapy. But 8 percent who got the surgery and Hipec died from the treatment itself. And critics say that since that trial was conducted, new drugs have come to market that allow patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to live two years with intravenous chemotherapy alone.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After nearly a year only one patient had enrolled, because people were reluctant to chance winding up in the control group, according to one of the investigators.\n\nWhile proponents contend that the risk of dying from the surgery has been reduced since the Dutch trial, the procedure still lasts eight hours or more and full recovery can take three to six months. “It’s maximally invasive,” said Dr. Sugarbaker, who often removes the “spare parts” — organs a patient can live without, like the spleen, the gall bladder, the ovaries and the uterus.\n\nThe cost of the surgery and Hipec, including hospitalization, ranges from $20,000 to more than $100,000, doctors said. While Medicare and insurers generally pay for the operation, the heated treatment may not be covered. But doctors added it may be if it is described merely as chemotherapy. Some patients, like Ms. Borges, who is a fitness devotee, recover well and say the procedure staved off a death sentence.\n\nBut Dr. Alan Venook, a colon cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco , said that a couple of patients referred by him had “died miserable deaths.

CT scans cannot pick up many of the small tumors, so it is often unclear how much cancer is inside until the patient is opened.\n\nIn June, Dr. Lowy sliced open a woman and saw, to his horror, that she had more tumors than he could remove. Taking out only some would not improve her chances of survival, so he closed the incision, and she is now starting intravenous chemotherapy.\n\nThings with the male patient, Andy S., went better. A 41-year-old father of two from near San Francisco , Mr. S. agreed to let a reporter observe the surgery, but asked that his full name not be published because he did not want his cancer history to surface through Web searches.\n\nMr. S. had abdominal pain eventually diagnosed as appendicitis . But the appendix was found to be cancerous. Such cancers typically spew mucus containing tumor cells into the abdominal cavity. So he signed up for surgery and Hipec with Dr. Lowy.\n\n“I’ve had to say my goodbyes to everybody,” Mr. S. said the day before the operation. “I had to talk to my priest. I had to do all these things I never thought I’d have to do at 41. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy, but I have to go through with it.”\n\nDr. Lowy explored the entire cavity from the diaphragm to the pelvis. He found mucus in several spots that he sopped up with a cloth and also tiny tumors the size of a pencil eraser that had implanted in several spots. He snipped those out and sewed up the wounds. He removed the right side of the man’s colon and the omentum, a fatty structure.\n\nThen two Y-shaped tubes hooked to the Hipec machine were inserted into the abdominal cavity, one to deliver the chemotherapy and the other to bring the drug back to the machine to be reheated. The incision was sewn up around the tubes so the chemotherapy would not leak.\n\nThe man’s belly was filled with three liters of saline fluid and the chemotherapy, a generic drug called mitomycin C, heated to 42 degrees Celsius, or nearly 108 degrees Fahrenheit. Any hotter could have caused injuries. Bloated with liquid, the man’s torso resembled a water bed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter 90 minutes, the fluid was drained and the incision reopened for a final check before the patient was stitched up. The procedure took six hours.\n\n“We got all of the visible disease, and he didn’t have a lot of visible disease,” Dr. Lowy said with satisfaction.\n\nMr. S. left the hospital eight days later, happy to have undergone the treatment. “I want to have the best chance I can have to never see this again,” he said.""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story provides an excellent look at the controversies related to a new form of treatment and the role of manufacturers in pushing its acceptance.<br/>

Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow.\n\nWhen a person suffers a heart attack, he or she is often left with huge areas of scarring in the heart. Scarred heart muscle doesn\'t pump blood as well as it used to, putting stress on other parts of the heart to make up for the deficit. The damaged area also doesn\'t conduct electric current as well, leading to an abnormal heart rhythm, which can cause more problems. Heart attack patients often go on to develop heart failure.\n\n\n\n""This is the first instance of therapeutic regeneration,"" says Dr. Eduardo Marbán, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute.\n\nHe says while nature abounds with examples of spontaneous regeneration of limbs or tissues - like a salamander\'s new tail or a human liver regrowing to full size if partially damaged - doctors have not been able to help patients regrow heart tissue. This could change in the future if larger clinical trials and longer patient outcomes confirm the results of this early research published Monday in the journal The Lancet.\n\nMarbán and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November.\n\nTo qualify for this clinical trial, patients had to have suffered a recent heart attack and ""had to have a significant amount of damage to begin with and weren\'t squeezing [blood into the body] as well as they should have,"" says Dr. Peter Johnston, one of the study authors who injected the new heart cells into patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nA total of 25 patients participated in the clinical trial, which was designed to determine if it was safe to have cells grown from one\'s own heart tissue injected back into the heart. Seventeen patients received the stem cell transplants, while the other eight patients were given conventional post-heart attack therapy.\n\nIn an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, doctors funneled a catheter into the patient\'s heart and removed peppercorn-sized bits of tissue from the part of the patient\'s heart that was unaffected by the heart attack. Using a procedure invented by Marbán, heart stem cells were isolated from the tissue and then millions of new cells were grown in a petri dish.\n\nAbout four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts.\n\nMarbán says when the first patient data came in, he and his colleagues were relieved to see the procedure was safe. After 12 months, researchers report only one patient appeared to have a serious side effect that may have been connected to the experimental cells.\n\nSix months after the first patient was injected with his cells grown from his own heart tissue, Marbán says there was dramatic shrinking of scar tissue and new tissue had grown. ""That was unprecedented"" he says. ""No one had demonstrated that before.""\n\nAll patients were followed for six months and researchers have 12-month data for 21 patients. In patients who received the cell transplant, Marbán says about half of their scar tissue dissolved and the reduction in scar size appears to get bigger after the first six months. He says that why this is happening is still unclear.\n\nMarbán says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. [On average] ""22 grams (about .78 ounces) of new heart tissue grew,"" which he says is quite remarkable considering this had never been done before and the average weight of the part of the heart that is responsible for pumping the blood through the body is about 150 grams (about 5.3 ounces).\n\nPatients in the control group, those who didn\'t get a cell transplant, did not regenerate any tissue and the amount of scar tissue they had remained the same.\n\nSonia Skarlatos, Ph.D and deputy director of the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says this early research is very exciting and a move in the right direction. She cautions that this procedure has to be tested on many more patients and they have to be observed for longer periods than in the current study, but she says these results are all very positive. She is hopeful further studies will confirm these early results.\n\n""By preventing the consequences of a heart attack you may be able to prevent further down the heart failure that happens in [many of these] patients."" Skarlatos says.\n\nShe was not involved in the research but the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute did help fund it.\n\nSkarlatos also says it\'s still not clear exactly what is making the heart regenerate and scar tissue disappear. Is it the cells themselves or proteins and other factors produced by these newly introduced cells that help fix the heart? Further research will hopefully also help answer those questions, she says. The study authors say based on these results, further research is warranted.\n\nMarbán, who began his research at Johns Hopkins, says ""we did see a glimmer [of regeneration] in animal testing,"" but the results in humans were much better. ""That doesn\'t usually happen this way in research.""']",CNN avoided the easy Valentine’s Day tie-in for this heart story and gave readers a clear picture of both the study’s importance and its limitations.

But they jibe with previous studies suggesting that getting cholesterol levels under control might help reduce the risk of life-threatening disease, researchers said.\n\n“People may be on these medications for their heart, but it may actually be doing them some good for their prostate,” said study author Dr. Stephen Marcella, from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in New Brunswick.\n\n“If a person’s on the fence about taking a statin medication for their heart, this is another potential benefit they may have by taking one of these,” he told Reuters Health.\n\nMarcella and his colleagues collected the medical records of 380 men who had died of prostate cancer and another 380 of the same age and race without prostate cancer or with non-lethal cancer.\n\nMost of the men were white and in their mid- to late-60s, on average. Close to one in four of the men in both groups combined had ever taken a statin.\n\nThe researchers found that men who died of prostate cancer were half as likely to have taken a statin at any time, and for any duration, than men in the “control” group.\n\nWhen they accounted for whether or not men were overweight and their other health problems and medications, it turned out that those with fatal cancers were 63 percent less likely to have ever taken a statin, according to findings published in Cancer.\n\nBut, Marcella added, “I would not tell a person if they don’t have a risk of heart disease, (if) they don’t have hypertension...to take a statin just to prevent lethal prostate cancer.”\n\nThe evidence that’s effective, he said, just isn’t there yet.\n\nAnd even if statins do turn out to help prevent fatal prostate cancer, researchers said, previous studies have suggested they don’t lower a man’s risk of getting less aggressive forms of the disease.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, about one in every six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point, and one in every 36 men will die of the disease.\n\nMarcella’s team didn’t have the data to figure out if taking a statin for longer, or starting one earlier, was more beneficial than more limited use of the drugs.\n\n‘VERY TRICKY TO SORT OUT’\n\nThe researchers also couldn’t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer.\n\nBut they did find that while high-potency, often newer statins were linked to a lower risk of fatal prostate cancer, lower-potency drugs were not. That suggests it’s something about the drugs themselves that lower men’s chances of dying from prostate cancer, Marcella said.\n\nStatins may protect against fatal prostate cancer through their known cholesterol-lowering effects, said Dr. Stephen Freedland, who studies prostate cancer at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, but wasn’t involved in the new study.\n\nHe said that cholesterol is a “key nutrient” for cancer cells, so lower cholesterol levels in the body could prevent more aggressive forms of cancer from developing.\n\nBut it’s also possible that statins don’t prevent certain cancers at all, Freedland said, and it’s something else about men who take statins — for example, if they also change their diet and start exercising — that explains their lower risk of fatal cancer.\n\n“It gets very, very tricky to sort out,” Freedland told Reuters Health.\n\nTo prove that statins protect against aggressive cancer would require a large study in which cancer-free men, or those with early-stage disease, are randomly assigned to take statins or not and then tracked for years to see how many of them die from cancer.\n\nThat type of study, especially involving healthy, disease-free men, would be very expensive and time consuming, said Dr. Nelly Tan, from the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied statins and prostate cancer risk.\n\nAbout one-quarter of adults age 45 and older in the U.S. take statins to lower cholesterol and protect against heart attacks. The drugs run anywhere from $11 to more than $200 per month, and sometimes cause side effects including muscle pain, nausea and gas and liver dysfunction.\n\nResearchers agreed that until there’s clearer evidence for benefit, men with healthy hearts shouldn’t seek out statin prescriptions for the purpose of lowering their prostate cancer risks.\n\nBut Freedland said that other strategies for lowering cholesterol — such as eating better and exercising regularly — are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/v7AokK Cancer, online December 16, 2011.']",Touch ’em all.  This story neatly addressed all 10 of our criteria.,"It really isn’t that difficult to address our criteria, as this story demonstrates.

Testing revealed Evangelina was born with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, also called SCID or ""bubble baby"" disease.\n\nIt\'s a genetic disorder that leaves the body with a weakened immune system, making infants extremely vulnerable to illness. It affects cells that play important roles in helping the immune system battle bacteria, viruses and fungi that can cause infections. Even the common cold can be deadly.\n\nSymptoms of the disease are frequently first noticed very early in life, as was the case with Evangelina. Babies with SCID often come down with recurrent, severe respiratory infections that can be life threatening, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.\n\n""We wore masks, we had hand sanitizer, we had raw hands from cleaning so much,"" Vaccaro recalled.\n\nThe Vaccaros turned to Dr. Donald Kohn at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at UCLA, where Kohn focuses on the development of new methods to treat genetic diseases of blood cells. They enrolled baby Evangelina in a clinical trial there.\n\nDr. Kohn said of an experimental treatment for SCID, ""It\'s gone from a \'one day, maybe\' to a real clinical reality.""\n\nThat means an actual cure for the disease, said Kohn, who is also director of the Human Gene Medicine Program at UCLA.

Only about 300 Americans are diagnosed with this cancer each year. The tumors can be complex to treat because they are located along the spinal cord, nerves and arteries. Chordomas are part of a group of tumors called sarcomas. While slow growing, they can be aggressive.\n\nLife-threatening tumor\n\nBlindsided by the news his tailbone pain was caused by a life-threatening tumor, Tracy sought information and opinions. His doctor referred him to specialists at a major medical center in San Francisco. He learned surgery is the most common treatment. But, a surgeon told Tracy and wife, Karin Rittenberg, he should prepare for possible complications.\n\nSaid Tracy, ""We were told that I should prepare myself for the loss of functionality below the waist – including bowel, bladder and sexual functions. Even with surgery, there was a high risk of recurrence. That\'s when we began to research other options, such as radiation therapy.""\n\nTreatment options\n\nThe couple then met with a radiation oncologist. The doctor explained in cases where surgery is not an option or the outcome of surgery was unacceptable, people turn to definitive radiation therapy. He provided Tracy and Karin with a copy of a published research paper on chordoma and the effects of definitive radiation. The lead author and researcher was Dr. Peyman Kabolizadeh, clinical director, Beaumont Proton Therapy Center in Royal Oak. While the findings were written for health care professionals and very technical, Tracy was encouraged.\n\n""Definitive radiation therapy refers to curative radiation,"" explained Dr. Kabolizadeh. ""Radiation is the only treatment the patient receives."" In his study published in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics, he and his colleagues found, ""in circumstances where surgery may result in significant neurologic or organ dysfunction, patients can be treated definitively with radiation therapy alone. The results supported the use of high-dose definitive radiation therapy, via proton beam therapy, for selected patients with unresected spine and sacral chordomas.""\n\nThe San Francisco radiation oncologist not only shared Dr. Kabolizadeh\'s research paper, but also his contact information. Both Tracy and Karin learned about the differences between photon and proton radiation. They did their homework on treatment options, but for Tracy it became quite frustrating. Karin persisted in her fact-finding, when Tracy was down emotionally.\n\n""You have to understand, because this cancer is so rare, there is limited research available,"" Tracy said. ""That was the truly scary part about making any decisions.""\n\nSecond, third and more opinions\n\nThey conferred with Dr. Kabolizadeh at Beaumont in Michigan by telephone. The couple also traveled to a highly-regarded cancer center in New York City.\n\n""It seemed everyone I spoke with had a different opinion,"" said Tracy. ""I then determined, definitive radiation therapy was the way to go, but I had to decide which type and where. There was photon therapy available in San Francisco, but, in my research, I found out the photon beams don\'t stop at the tumor and have a greater possibility of affecting surrounding organs, too. I liked what I heard about the advantages of proton beams precisely targeting the tumor and stopping, sparing nearby tissue from harmful radiation.""\n\nDeciding on proton therapy\n\nSeveral factors went into Tracy\'s decision to choose proton therapy at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. Not only were he and Karin impressed with the advanced cancer killing capabilities of the pencil beam proton therapy, but also with the expertise of Dr. Kabolizadeh.\n\n""I looked at survivability, length of life and quality of life. Right now, I\'m living life to the fullest and have a beautiful wife. We travel, entertain friends and are diehard Giants fans,"" explained Tracy. ""Beaumont has the most advanced equipment, and someone who is familiar with treatments for my rare cancer. I felt that gave me the best chance of success. Dr. Kabolizadeh has the vehicle and knows how to drive it! Every time we spoke, he was honest, open and candid. His candor was refreshing.""\n\nAbout 3 months after his cancer diagnosis, Tracy traveled to Royal Oak in late January to begin his proton treatments. On Tuesday, April 3, he completed his nine weeks of treatment.\n\nHe not only looks forward to watching his beloved Giants at AT&T Park, but hanging out with his dog Neyo. And Karin looks forward to him shaving the ""treatment beard"" he has been growing since his treatments began.\n\nBeaumont proton team \'second to none\'\n\n""I realize I\'m extremely fortunate to have been able to consider traveling to another state for treatment and live there for two and a half months,"" said Tracy. ""I\'m also fortunate that Karin\'s company has been supportive of her working remotely so she could stay with me. And I\'m so grateful for the tremendous outpouring of love and support we\'ve received from our family and friends during our stay in Michigan. That helped keep our spirits high.""\n\nAnd when asked about his treatment experience, Tracy remarked, ""Every single person that I\'ve engaged with at Beaumont has been a delight. They all made what could have been a difficult experience tolerable. The facilities are impressive, clean and welcoming, but the difference is the people – best hospital staff I\'ve ever encountered. The team in the Proton Therapy Center is second to none.""\n\nAbout Beaumont\'s Proton Therapy Center\n\nBeaumont\'s center is one of just 28 proton therapy centers in the U.S. It is the only operational proton therapy center in Michigan.\n\nHow proton therapy works\n\nProton therapy is a high-tech alternative to X-ray radiation. A scanning beam of proton radiation with online image guidance offers greater precision to destroy cancerous cells, sparing adjacent healthy tissue with fewer side effects.\n\nProton therapy uses positively charged atomic particles, traveling up to two-thirds the speed of light, to fight cancer. A cyclotron, or particle accelerator, creates protons from hydrogen molecules. The proton beam is sent to the treatment room through a transport system consisting of magnets, called the beam line, finally arriving in the gantry, a device that rotates around the patient. The beam is directed to the patient through a nozzle that targets the tumor.\n\nWhile proton therapy is not effective against all cancers, it is effective in treating many solid and localized tumors.\n\nAdvanced technology\n\n""Our IBA ProteusOne single-room treatment system includes precision technologies,"" said Dr. Kabolizadeh. ""Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy, which combines Pencil Beam Scanning and 3-D Cone Beam CT, can target a tumor within less than a millimeter.""\n\nPencil Beam Scanning refers to the delivery of protons in a thin beam. Like a pencil, the beam uses back and forth motions to target the treatment area – the shape, size and depth. It ""paints"" a radiation dose on tumors layer by layer. Compared to X-ray beams, which pass through a patient, proton beams deliver targeted radiation to the tumor and then stop – resulting in no exit dose.\n\nRadiation oncologists at Beaumont are well versed in precise image guidance, having developed cone beam CT technology almost 20 years ago.\n\nDr. Kabolizadeh explained, ""Image guidance allows doctors to visualize tumors during therapy to assess response and make sure the tumor is treated correctly every day.""\n\nComprehensive cancer care\n\nProton therapy is an important addition to Beaumont\'s comprehensive arsenal of leading-edge cancer treatments. Beaumont\'s Radiation Oncology department is ranked among the nation\'s best for advanced technology, innovative treatment and research. Advanced radiation treatments developed at Beaumont include adaptive radiation therapy, image-guided radiation therapy, intensity-modulated arc therapy, high-dose rate brachytherapy and hyperthermia therapy.\n\nTo learn more about the new center and its capabilities, call Beaumont\'s Radiation Oncology program at 248-551-8402 or go to www.Beaumont.org/proton-therapy.\n\nMedia contacts:\n\nRobert.Ortlieb@beaumont.org, 248-551-1077\n\nMark.Geary@beaumont.org, 248-551-0743\n\nSOURCE Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.Beaumont.org\n\n']",Readers might expect to see at least one measurement indicating how much improvement was seen in the sole patient profiled in this release.

Specifically, the news release promotes the idea of educational videos (i.e. for managing infant pain), giving a baby sugar water, and — most effectively, according to a study — spreading lidocaine cream on a baby’s skin before a round of injections. The release would have benefited from a clearer description of what type of lidocaine was used (over-the-counter or one only available with a prescription?) and a discussion of harms and some numbers to back up the benefit claim.

Medications and psychotherapy are the primary treatments. Many older adults prefer psychotherapy to medication for the treatment of anxiety. However, older adults who live in rural areas can face a number of barriers, including living in an area where psychotherapy is not available, so alternate methods of providing treatment could increase utilization, according to the study background.\n\nGretchen A. Brenes, Ph.D., of the Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, N.C., and coauthors compared telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with telephone-delivered nondirective supportive therapy (NST) in a randomized clinical trial of 141 adults 60 or older with generalized anxiety disorder. The participants (70 were assigned to telephone CBT and 71 to telephone NST) were followed up at two months and four months.\n\nTelephone CBT consisted of up to 11 sessions (nine required) and focused on, among other things, anxiety symptom recognition, cognitive restructuring, relaxation, coping statements and problem solving. Telephone NST was 10 sessions where participants discussed their feelings but no direct suggestions for coping were provided.\n\nThe clinical trial demonstrated both treatments reduced symptoms of worry, depression and GAD, but telephone CBT was superior to telephone NST and resulted in a greater reduction of symptoms.\n\nAt four month’s follow-up there was greater decline in worry severity among telephone CBT participants but no significant differences in general anxiety symptoms. At four months’ follow-up there also was greater decline in self-reported GAD symptoms and depressive symptoms among participants in the telephone CBT, according to the results.\n\n“Telephone-delivered psychotherapy is one way to overcome some barriers to mental health treatment that rural older adults face,” the study concludes.\n\n(JAMA Psychiatry.

And the news is very good.\n\nThe paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective, they found that it offered a lasting benefit, reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12-month study period.\n\n“This study represents a major advance for neurosurgery, treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of ET,” Elias said. “For the first time in a randomized controlled trial, we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease.”\n\nPioneering Tremor TrialThe multi-site clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor, a condition that often robs people of their ability to write, feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The mean age was 71, and most had suffered with their tremor for many years.\n\nSeventy-five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging. The remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure, to act as the control group. (They would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure.)\n\nParticipants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement, with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period. The researchers employed a 32-point scale to assess tremor severity, and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months. Participants reported major improvements in their quality of life. People who couldn’t feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so.\n\nParticipants who received the sham procedure, on the other hand, showed no significant improvements.\n\n“The degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study, but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life – that’s what patients really care about,” Elias said.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face; in most instances, these side effects were temporary but some were permanent.\n\nFDA Approved Based on the clinical trial led by Elias, the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the focused ultrasound device, manufactured by InSightec Inc., for the treatment of essential tremor. The device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. That heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor. Elias can actually watch as patients’ tremor decreases, and the real-time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain.\n\nThe FDA approval means UVA can make the procedure available to eligible patients. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it’s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients. Because the approach is so new, insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure, though that may change in the coming months. The cost at UVA has not yet been determined.\n\nPeople interested in the procedure can learn more at uvahealth.com/focusedultrasound. The site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as UVA prepares to make the treatment available.\n\nThe procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. It can’t be used in patients who cannot undergo MRI imaging, including those with implanted metallic devices such as a pacemaker. It is also not available for pregnant women, people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure, patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders, patients on blood thinners, patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues. There are other exclusions as well. Doctors at UVA will evaluate potential patients to determine their eligibility and then recommend the best course of treatment.\n\nGroundbreaking ResearchUVA is a world leader in focused ultrasound research. Elias and his colleagues are testing the capability of focused ultrasound to treat Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, brain tumors and benign breast tumors.\n\nThe essential tremor research has been supported by InSightec, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the BIRD (US-Israel Binational Industry Research and Development) Foundation.\n\nFOR REPORTERS: Elias will be available for interviews today, and he’ll be doing a Facebook Live broadcast at 3:15 Eastern. To arrange an interview, contact Alex Prevost at 434.906.7255 or amp3gb@virginia.edu. High-resolution images and video are available as well.\n\n####']",More than a third of the patients in the study developed gait problems or numbness. These side effects of the surgery were downplayed in the release.,"This release reports the results of a randomized, multicenter, sham-controlled clinical trial testing the safety and efficacy of a new approach to controlling essential tremors in the elderly — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound — to alter the thalamus in the brain and thus control tremors. The approach would be an alternative to the current procedure — deep-brain stimulation — which is more invasive.
The study showed substantial improvement in a reduction of tremors for many patients at three-, six- and 12-months.  But it also showed that about a third of the patients in the study experienced not insignificant adverse effects from the procedure. The release presents a glowing picture of the promise of this new approach while disregarding the caveats offered both in the journal paper and an accompanying editorial about the study.
To see how a news outlet covered this new research, see our review of a STAT article.  Like the news release, the STAT story didn’t provide us enough quantification of the benefits or mention a potentional conflict of interest between researchers and device manufacturers. But the STAT article picked up on some things the release missed, including more discussion of the harms observed in the study.

Women in menopause or those who cannot take estrogen, including our breast cancer survivors, often suffer in silence when their vagina decides to completely dry up and lose its moist and supple lining, causing disruptive symptoms. It can affect your ability to do everyday activities such as exercise and engage in sexual contact and intercourse due to pain and discomfort.\n\nSymptoms of VVA include dryness, burning, irritation, itching, urinary incontinence and urinary frequency. These symptoms are mainly caused by a condition called vaginal atrophy, which is due to menopause or peri-menopause or occurs after child birth.\n\nWomen with VVA report the following:\n\n75 percent of women report vaginal atrophy negatively impacts their lives.\n\n63 percent failed to recognize vaginal atrophy as a chronic condition.\n\n44 percent report they did not consult a gynecologist for finding a solution.\n\n4 percent only recognized the common symptoms of vaginal atrophy.\n\nEstrogen is the best treatment option for VVA since it rehydrates the vagina and restores lubrication and pH balance in the vagina. Unfortunately, this is not always an appropriate option, especially if you have breast cancer or are unable or unwilling to be on estrogen. Other medication options include Osphena, vaginal estrogen, steroid and testosterone creams, and lubrications or moisturizers.\n\nThe Mona Lisa Touch Laser Treatment, or MLLT, is one of the newest kids on the block to combat vaginal atrophy. There are other types of vaginal lasers, but they don't have the same track record, Food and Drug Administration support and long-term studies as the MLLT. An Italian-built laser device, the Mona Lisa Touch Laser holds tremendous promise in treating a vagina that has been transformed in menopause or via cancer treatment side effects.\n\nOnce you've had a pelvic exam to assure you're an appropriate candidate, a physician trained in the use of the Mona Lisa – which is actually a small vaginal laser – inserts the device into the vagina during three 4-minute sessions, six weeks apart. Many women report positive changes after just the first 4-minute treatment, which involves removing the dried skin inside that vagina, stimulating collagen and blood flow production, and allowing vaginal revival. The end result is a vagina makeover – a new lease on a vagina, if you will – with more elasticity and natural lubrication of the tissue inside the vagina. Although it may sound too good to be true, the results are proving to be a game changer in the way vagina atrophy is being treated – without hormones – which is a relief to many women and their partners.\n\nMona Lisa is ideal for women who can't take estrogen due to a personal or family history of breast cancer or for those who are unhappy with the side effects associated with hormone replacement therapy. Still, there is a painful part of the procedure: the cost. It runs about $1,000 a session and is most likely not covered by insurance.""]","Without any discussion of evidence, this story makes big claims that border on disease-mongering.","This mostly data-free story is by a self-described (on her website) OB-GYN and lifestyle “entrepreneur,” and reads much like a promotional piece for one brand of a growing number of laser-based devices used to treat vulvo-vaginal atrophy.
By some estimates, a majority of women experience vulvo-vaginal atrophy during and after menopause, childbirth, or cancer treatment, and for many, the symptoms can include burning, itching, irritation and pain during sexual intercourse. A host of of medicinal therapies, including the gold standard of low-dose local  estrogen, hormone creams, and topical lubricants are available.
Although the article notes the availability of other laser-based device and medicinal options, it makes unsupported claims for the superiority of the Mona Lisa Touch Laser (MLTL), stating “there has not been a successful non-medication alternative treatment option for vaginal dryness.” The rationale offered for such praise is that the other vaginal lasers “don’t have the same track record,” but in fact all of the devices marketed in the U.S. have U.S. Food and Drug approval.
The overall issue for women who want to treat vaginal dryness is that the bar is set very low for FDA approval of devices (in contrast to studies needed to approved medicines), and although the article touts the MLTL as having undergone “long term studies,” the literature suggests that the longest follow up in studies of it and its shelf mates is closer to 12 weeks.
Overall, the device highlighted here has been tested in only a few studies involving a few hundred women worldwide, and long-term effects of using this or any laser to essentially “remodel” the vagina by removing layers of built-up dry skin are unknown.

Ketamine infusion therapy, the controversial treatment for depression, has been resisted by many physicians due to concerns about short-lived benefits, risks of addiction, and the lack of large scale studies. In contrast, this retrospective study of over three years of clinical experience, shows lasting benefits for many patients, with no apparent risk of addiction. Through a handful of ketamine infusions directed by Theodore Henderson, MD, PhD, refractory depression symptoms can be relieved significantly and persistently. Evidence points to the regeneration of brain cells as a critical mechanism for the relief of depression, as published in peer-reviewed journal Neural Regeneration Research, February 2016 issue.\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160316/345149\n\nThe study, ""Practical application of the neuroregenerative properties of ketamine: real world treatment experience,"" addresses key points in the controversy surrounding the use of intravenous ketamine for the treatment of depression. Its findings stand in direct contrast to warnings from the American Psychiatric Association (APA).\n\nWhile controversial in academic settings, Dr. Henderson said his direct experience supports a different strategy for multiple-infusion treatment regimens and his clinical experience shows ketamine can invoke long-lasting effects often with less than six infusions.\n\n""The wealth of clinical experience from treating hundreds of patients with ketamine has supplanted the preliminary data that emerged from the initial open-label and small double-blinded studies,"" said Dr. Henderson, who is a board certified psychiatrist, specializing in diagnosing and treating complex conditions, based in Denver, Colorado. He is also the co-founder of Neuro-Luminance Ketamine Infusion Centers.\n\nPatients in the study completed the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR), among other scales, and 80% showed persistent positive response to the ketamine infusions treatments.\n\nWhat is a Ketamine Infusion?\n\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic in use since 1970\'s. Intravenous administration over a prolonged period of time is key to its persistent antidepressant benefit.\n\nDepression is associated with neuron loss, reduced synapse numbers, and dearborization of dendrites. Ketamine appears to potently induce mechanisms which reverse these neuro-degenerative processes. Citing over 60 published scientific research studies, the new research article also reviews the molecular mechanisms by which ketamine invokes a robust activation of the brain\'s own repair mechanisms. Another conclusion Dr. Henderson highlights is ketamine infusions can relieve refractory depression symptoms persistently, perhaps for years.\n\n""Activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) appears to have an important role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. BDNF induces synaptogenesis, dendritic arborization, improved neuronal health, and neurogenesis. These processes likely underlie the persistent benefits of ketamine.""\n\nDr. Henderson\'s findings challenge the oft-held beliefs that ketamine must be given frequently to have any benefit and that ketamine has no long-lasting benefit.\n\nDr. Henderson stated, ""Misconceptions about ketamine abound among psychiatrists, particularly related to possible chemical dependence problems. However, the neurobiological basis of its benefit for depression has nothing to do with causing addictive risk. Our patients get better after a few infusions and from there treatments can be discontinued."" The study also challenges concerns about neurotoxicity and a recent hypothesis that patients must experience hallucinations during ketamine infusion in order to have an anti-depressant benefit.\n\nPlease visit Neuro-Luminance or call (855) 978-0808 for more information.\n\nMedia Contact: David Jahr, (949) 874-2667\n\nSOURCE Neuro-Luminance']",This news release relies primarily on anecdotal data while promoting privately held treatment centers.,"This news release cites findings from a physician’s “real world experience” in using the anesthesia drug ketamine for the treatment of depression, and promotes the Neuro-Luminence Ketamine Infusion Centers, which the study author  Dr. Theodore Henderson, co-founded. Acknowledged in the release as “controversial” and in direct opposition to the recommendations of the American Psychiatric Association, the use of ketamine can improve depression symptoms with six infusions or less, according to the release. The news release is thin on the kinds of facts we look for to support assertions about a drug’s safety and efficacy. It doesn’t address cost, benefit data or harms. It touts the putative benefits of a treatment that has not been approved by federal health authorities as either safe or effective, and it offers little evidence to support its use. It makes no mention of randomized trials in terms of real data–the only way one can tell if a treatment is really of benefit.

The findings were presented Dec. 6 at the 57th annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Orlando, Florida.\n\nPatients with cancers of the immune system, like multiple myeloma, are especially susceptible to common infections, and a bout of the flu can lead to serious illness and even death. Even though patients with multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders may receive an annual flu vaccine, studies show that a one-time flu shot does not offer adequate immune response.\n\nThe Yale researchers developed a strategy that entailed offering patients a high-dose flu vaccine followed by a second high-dose booster shot one month later. The high-dose vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose) was approved in 2009 by the FDA as a single dose for adults over 65.\n\nThe booster strategy lowered the flu infection rate among patients to 6% versus an expected rate of 20%, and it improved protection against all flu strains covered by the vaccine in 66% of patients, said the study\'s first author Andrew Branagan, M.D., a postdoctoral associate in medicine (hematology).\n\n""Using an approved flu vaccine in a novel dosing schedule yielded promising results for a group patients at high risk for infection,"" Branagan said.

Powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room.\n\nOn one particularly bad night, Ms. DiGiusto watched from her hospital bed as doctors and nurses prepared to insert plastic tubing down her windpipe to help her breathe. Gasping for air, she was certain she would not survive.\n\n“I’ll never forget that feeling,” said Ms. DiGiusto, 65, a speech pathologist in Braintree, Mass. “The feeling that I’m never going to see my kids or husband again and that asthma is finally going to get me.”\n\nTwo years ago, Ms. DiGiusto’s doctor told her about a new procedure called bronchial thermoplasty, the first non-drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe asthma.\n\nDuring the procedure, a doctor guides a bronchoscope into a patient’s airways. There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit — cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.\n\nMs. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011. Since then, she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack. “I’m a language therapist,” she said, “but I can’t even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life.”\n\nAcross the country, about 24 million people suffer from asthma. Every year, about 3,400 die because of it.\n\nAvoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients. But for the minority with severe persistent asthma, medication and lifestyle changes are not enough. Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone — which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects — become a necessity.\n\nNationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.\n\nDoctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing. But the procedure is expensive, costing around $20,000, and insurers have been reluctant to cover it. As a result, many people who need it, doctors say, are forced to go without it.\n\n“For those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are, it’s frustrating because we have this new therapy, we’ve seen it work, and the data says it works,” said Dr. Roy St. John, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbus Pulmonary and Critical Care in Ohio. “But the big insurers have all denied it.”\n\nAlthough bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the F.D.A. only two years ago, clinical studies on it began in 2000. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure.\n\nIt takes place in three steps, each separated by about three weeks. Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.\n\nBut several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.\n\n“This isn’t a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough,” said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. “It’s not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life.” For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who — unlike a vast majority of asthma patients — cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.\n\n“There are millions and millions of asthmatics,” he said. “There will not be millions of thermoplasty patients.”\n\nStill, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty. That trial will not be completed until at least 2018.\n\nUntil then, Ms. Pisano said, many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental. “The issue here for health plans is the long-term safety and efficacy have yet to be established,” she said.\n\nBut three five-year studies have already been completed. Many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year.\n\nOne such patient, Alberto Gaulion, 68, a retired importer in Miami, estimated that for much of the last decade, his insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent about $50,000 a year on his medical care.\n\n“Every two or three weeks I had to go to the hospital,” he said, “and I was taking everything that was on the market. I was on a cocktail of drugs.”\n\nBlue Cross would not cover the procedure for him, so Mr. Gaulion paid out of pocket when he had it in 2010. Since then, he has had no hospital visits and no asthma attacks, and takes only one medication instead of five.\n\n“Now I can breathe,” he said, “and I’m saving my insurance company a fortune.”\n\nDr. Charlene McEvoy, a director of an asthma center run by Health Partners, the largest health plan in Minnesota, believed in thermoplasty enough to push the insurer to start covering it. Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.\n\n“When plans look at the cost savings, I think they’re going to cover it,” said Dr. McEvoy, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. “You have to show that there’s a return on investment.”']","We applaud this story’s attention to an issue than transcends the “study of the day” mentality of most health reporting, but we wish it had attacked the subject with a more careful and evidence-based perspective.","This premise of this story is that the insurance industry may be dragging its feet on coverage for a new FDA approved treatment for severe asthma called bronchial thermoplasty. Unfortunately, this promising argument is undermined by an inappropriate reliance on anecdotes and a highly selective reporting of the evidence that supports this treatment. The story refers to study outcomes that favor the treatment but omits findings that cut the other way. It reports results in relative rather than absolute terms. Long-term saftey is emphasized at the expense of serious short-term risks that could land patients in the hospital.

In both studies, the ring lowered HIV cases by about 30%, though its effectiveness appears to be much better for women who used the ring consistently.\n\nThe ring contains an antiretroviral medication called dapivirine, which prevents HIV from making copies of itself. In the ring, the drug is used as “pre-exposure prophylaxis,” or PrEP, slowly leaching out in the vagina and preventing the virus from taking hold in nearby cells.\n\nOne of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries — Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe — over nearly two years. At the end of the study, the group of volunteers who had used the dapivirine ring had 27% fewer HIV infections than a control group who had a placebo ring with no drug, the study found.\n\nLooking by age, the researchers saw that the ring did not seem to help women younger than 21. But among women over the age of 21 who used it, new HIV cases went down by 61%.\n\nThe other study, which has not yet been published but was presented on Monday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections meeting in Boston, studied 2,000 women in South Africa and Uganda. Like the other study, in this one the ring had no visible effect in women younger than 21, whereas new HIV cases dropped by 37% in women over 21.\n\nThese age differences are probably due in part to how the women used the drug, the researchers say. Much like the contraceptive NuvaRing, the dapivirine ring should be kept in every day and replaced once a month for maximum effectiveness.\n\n“If used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? We don’t know that yet,” Jared Baeten, professor of global health, medicine, and epidemiology at the University of Washington and lead author on the study, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nAdherence is also a big issue for the only other PrEP on the market, a once-a-day pill called Truvada. Initial trials for the pill showed it led to a 44% decrease in HIV infection rates overall. But it’s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. Because of its high effectiveness, the CDC has since recommended that 1 in 4 gay and bisexual men should be prescribed the drug to prevent the spread of HIV.\n\nThe ring adds a new HIV prevention tool, which some experts say will be particularly useful in African countries where women are at highest risk for HIV infection. More than half of the 35 million people living with HIV worldwide are women, and the vast majority live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n“A prevention tool like a ring could be used discreetly, a woman would have control over it, and it could allow her to keep herself safe from HIV without having to ask a male partner to take on prevention strategies,” Baeten said. “That individual control of prevention is so powerful.”\n\nThe dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman’s sole source of protection.\n\n“There is absolute reason to celebrate. But 27% is a lower number than any of us would like to see,” Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global HIV-prevention advocacy group, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n“We obviously always want higher numbers. But 1 in 3 infections were prevented overall — and that’s huge.”\n\nWarren noted that other rings with antiretrovirals are also being developed, as well as rings that could offer multipurpose protection, against not only HIV but pregnancy.\n\nLike birth control, the more types of HIV prevention, the better, experts say.\n\n“For some women, a pill every day might work really well. For others, that may be not achievable,” Baeten said. “Pills and rings should be sitting next to each other as options.”']",An informative story on the benefits of the vaginal ring to prevent HIV in Africa would have been improved with outside experts.,"Vaginal ring. Credit: International Partnership for Microbicides
This article discusses two studies surrounding a new device for preventing HIV infection. The device is a vaginal ring that dispenses an antiviral compound called dapivirine which can prevent the spread of HIV in women, according to scientists presenting their research at a medical conference. The device must be worn daily and replaced monthly in order to be effective. One of the studies described was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the other was an unpublished abstract. The ring contains an antiviral agent that works against the virus, but experts caution this method only seems to curb about 27 percent of transmissions from one sexual partner to the other. This story does a good job of providing context, although we would have liked a more cautious headline (and less use of the word “huge,” in general, in the text) and a better definition of pre-exposure prophylaxis since previous efforts have mainly focused on treating those who already contracted the virus. We applaud the careful way the story gave details of the two research studies, including their size and length and where they were conducted.

Most are given radiation, but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent.\n\nThe study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute, showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment, 76.3 percent were still alive after 12 years, compared to 71.3 percent who had radiation alone.']",This was a complex study and the story did a good job in presenting it to readers.,"The New York Times covers a study of a treatment for prostate cancer that comes back after prostate removal surgery. The treatment is hormone blocking, or androgen deprivation therapy. In this review, we’ll occasionally compare the coverage to STAT’s story about the same study (see that story review here), since it highlights a few important ways reporters and their outlets deviate in their coverage of important research.
The Times does a nice job in capturing a complete portrait of prostate cancer, the problem with recurrence, and the difficulty in understanding why hormone blockers weren’t obviously beneficial — at least according to prior research. But what we appreciated the most was how it described the benefits of giving men hormone blockers in absolute terms; this is a more honest presentation of data, and doesn’t hype study results (unlike relative comparisons, in which a cure rate of say, 2%, is “double” a cure rate of 1%).
The weak points of the story: It didn’t discuss the costs of treating prostate cancer, especially with hormone blockers, and it missed an important potential conflict of interest.

REUTERS/Michaela Rehle\n\nPeople who have coronary artery disease ruled out by the scan benefit, and so do those with severe blockages diagnosed, while those who have moderate artery disease confirmed may only become more anxious after the scan, researchers found.\n\nComputed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), is a high-resolution X-ray of the heart that can be used to diagnose the reason for angina, or chest pain, symptoms and clarify what other treatments might be needed.\n\n“Patients with normal coronary arteries or those with severe coronary artery disease seemed to get the most benefit in quality of life and did best,” senior study author Dr. David E. Newby from University/BHF Center for Cardiovascular Science in Edinburgh, told Reuters Health.\n\n“This suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and CTCA really helps provide this reassurance. Conversely, knowing the cause of your symptoms is due to coronary heart disease and patients undergo treatment for it, is also very helpful,” he said by email.\n\nAlthough getting CTCA is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on, its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary, the researchers note in the journal Heart.\n\nNewby and his team assessed how CTCA affected symptoms and quality of life six weeks and six months after the scan for 4,146 patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease.\n\nWhen the CTCA results revealed something less than a blockage, so-called nonobstructive disease, as the cause for the patient’s chest pain, patients’ quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months.\n\nThis reflects the fact that the cause of the symptoms had been unknown before and in addition they now have heart artery disease that needs treatment, Newby said.\n\nThe findings were similar when it came to changes in symptoms during follow-up. Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.\n\n“Although CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,” Newby said. “Much like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,” he added.\n\nIf a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.\n\n“If, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,” Newby said. “Certainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.”\n\n“It was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,” said Dr. Paula M. C. Mommersteeg from the Center of Research on Psychology in Somatic Diseases, Tilburg University, The Netherlands, who has investigated associations between personality traits and coronary artery disease symptoms.\n\n“In my opinion, CTCA does have added value in the diagnostic process (improved decision making), it is less invasive than coronary angiography (CAG), and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients,” Mommersteeg concluded.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2lEdxAV Heart, online February 28, 2017.']",Other approaches to addressing uncertainties about a patient’s heart condition — including stress tests — would have been useful to include.,"This story explores the influence of computed tomography (CT) scans of blood flow in the heart on symptoms and quality of life of chest pain patients. The story makes clear that the benefits vary, with the most benefit going to those patients who are either told they can stop medical treatment or that there is effective treatment for them. Patients who discovered their disease was worse than they had believed fared worse after they received the scans.
Readers get a sense that the decision to add computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) — a high-resolution X-ray of the heart — to their diagnostic process should be approached individually. The value of this nuanced description of the study results is undercut, however, by a lack of context. Readers are not given any background about other approaches to managing anxiety and uncertainty in patients with chest pain. The story fails to note costs of the test and the study limitations that researchers listed in their journal article. The article also omitted one of the downsides of screening tests: the potential for over-diagnosis leading to unnecessary, stress-producing follow-up tests.

""It is very big. It has the potential to turn cancer into a chronic disease, because we can monitor patients individually and respond with treatment to the genetic makeup of their cancer.""\n\nToner says the test is like a liquid biopsy and targets almost all solid cancers -- cancers found in ""solid"" organs like the breast or prostate.

In fact, a tube of blood taken during an annual exam would only have a few CTCs.\n\n""The challenging goal of sorting extremely rare circulating tumor cells from blood requires continuous technological, biological and clinical innovation to fully explore the utility of these precious cells in clinical oncology,"" Toner said.

It may be psychologically harmful for some women and play a significant role in the development of postpartum depression,” said Grace Lim, M.D., director of obstetric anesthesiology at Magee Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and lead investigator on the study. “We found that certain women who experience good pain relief from epidural analgesia are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms in the postpartum period.”\n\nThe researchers controlled for factors already known to increase the risk for postpartum depression, including pre-existing depression and anxiety, as well as post-delivery pain caused by tissue trauma during childbirth. After accounting for these factors, the study found that in some women, labor pain was still a significant risk factor for postpartum depression symptoms. And, therefore, alleviating this pain might help reduce the risk for postpartum depression. In the study, researchers reviewed the medical records of 201 women who used epidural analgesia and had their pain assessed using a 0-10 scale during labor. They calculated the percent improvement in pain (PIP) throughout labor after the implementation of epidural analgesia. Depression risk was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) six weeks after childbirth. Researchers found the higher the PIP scores, the lower the EPDS scores.\n\n“Although we found an association between women who experience less pain during labor and lower risk for postpartum depression, we do not know if effective pain control with epidural analgesia will assure avoidance of the condition,” said Dr. Lim. “Postpartum depression can develop from a number of things including hormonal changes, psychological adjustment to motherhood, social support, and a history of psychiatric disorders.”\n\nLabor pain may be more problematic for some women than others, the authors note. Additional research is needed to identify which women are more likely to experience severe labor pain and who would benefit the most from effective labor pain-control strategies to help reduce the risk and affect of pain on postpartum recovery.\n\nTHE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTSFounded in 1905, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is an educational, research and scientific society with more than 52,000 members organized to raise and maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology. ASA is committed to ensuring physician anesthesiologists evaluate and supervise the medical care of patients before, during and after surgery to provide the highest quality and safest care every patient deserves.\n\nFor more information on the field of anesthesiology, visit the American Society of Anesthesiologists online at asahq.org.

It instead relies heavily on association which does not prove causation.","A news release from the American Society of Anesthesiologists highlights the results of a preliminary study on the effect epidurals might have on post-partum depression.
According to the release, “some” of 201 women who choose epidural pain relief during the birth of their child saw a decreased risk of developing postpartum depression, or PPD. Specifically, those who scored lower on a pain improvement scale showed a lower likelihood of developing PPD. The release notes two risk factors were accounted for in detecting this association — depression and tissue trauma caused by birth — and indirectly hedges on how something else may be responsible for the perceived effect
However, that’s where the utility of this release ends and its problems begin. How many women saw a benefit? What about the strength of the effect? Were all of the biggest confounding factors accounted for, like social support and economic status? Why weren’t women who chose natural births not used as controls? And is natural birth really so risky and traumatic, as this release implies?
Those are just a few of the important questions that this release (and even the not-yet peer-reviewed study it’s based on) fail to answer or simply address. The tone of the news release and the abstract (both by the American Society of Anesthesiologists) suggests that epidural anesthesia is helpful in preventing postpartum depression, but that assertion remains far from proven. A number of health journalists have picked up this news release and some provided important background details and caveats not found in the American Society of Anesthesiologists release. This article in Cosmopolitan magazine — despite an unfortunate subheadline touting “amazing superpowers” — is a good example. It acknowledges other research suggesting that “…it’s not just the degree of pain, but the amount of support a woman receives during childbirth that can influence whether she’s traumatized by the whole experience and develops depressive symptoms because of it.”

The weather was rotten, an earlier appointment ran long — and 15-year-old Jordan was the picture of health.\n\nToday, the Cincinnati mother of two is thankful she didn\'t. Doctors diagnosed Jordan with aortic root dilation, a potentially life-threatening heart defect. They advised the teen — who played six sports, his favorite being baseball — to quit competitive athletics for good.\n\nFor decades pediatricians and family physicians have sought a more effective way to identify young athletes at risk of dying while playing the sports they love.\n\nNow, the Heart Institute at Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital Medical Center is testing a new method. In the most complete test of its kind, the institute is using both an electrocardiogram and limited echocardiogram to see the rhythm and structure of the heart.\n\nIf proved effective, it could become the norm for identifying heart conditions that put one in 10,000 people at risk when doing top-level physical activities, researchers say.\n\nSince the study began about a year ago, 500 local teens have been screened and 26 diagnosed with heart abnormalities. Twenty-two can continue in athletics, though they\'ll require lifelong monitoring.\n\nFour young athletes, two girls and two boys, have been advised to quit sports altogether. Researchers hope to screen a total of 640 before they\'re done.\n\nSo far, their work is turning up a higher rate of heart abnormalities than expected.\n\nJordan was one of the more serious cases.\n\nThat day at his appointment, he, his mother and little sister Jaelynne sat astonished as doctors described a dangerously large root in Jordan\'s heart. Because of its size, it could rupture if stressed by too much physical activity. The effects could kill him.\n\nJordan took his doctor\'s advice and quit the sports he loved.\n\n""The saddest day for me had to be the day of (baseball) try-outs,"" Jordan says. ""I woke up, and I couldn\'t go to try-outs. After that I just started to cope.""\n\nPrecise diagnoses sought\n\nCases of high school athletes collapsing and dying on sports fields most often result from undiagnosed heart defects, says Dr. Jeffrey Towbin, co-director and head of clinical care at the Heart Institute. Victims often show no earlier symptoms, looking the picture of health.\n\nTowbin asked two pediatric cardiologists — Dr. Jeff Anderson and Dr. Michelle Grenier —to take on the study that he\'d wanted to do since joining the Heart Institute 3 and one-half years ago.\n\n""One of our goals is to advance the field … in areas either untouched or unappreciated as being important,"" Towbin says. ""These cases are obviously each a tragic event that occur in every city a few times a year.""\n\nAs high school sports begin this year, the caution takes on increased urgency.\n\nLocally, swimmer Jose Cerda Navarro became unconscious during practice with his private swim club in October 2010. He died within the hour at the hospital, on this 18th birthday.\n\nCameron Batson, 18, died a few weeks before that, while playing a game of pick-up soccer. He had graduated that spring from high school in Covington.\n\nIn the United States, a doctor must approve participation in a school or competitive sports league. Approval is generally granted to teens with little to no family history of heart problems and a physical exam devoid of medical red flags.\n\nSome years ago, Italy instituted a countrywide rule requiring competitive athletes to undergo an electrocardiogram, a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nFewer Italian athletes died after the testing began, but the tests also had a relatively high rate of falsely reporting medical problems. That led to unnecessary physical restrictions of athletes.\n\n""There\'s got to be a better way,"" Anderson said. ""That\'s what we set out to answer.""\n\nAnderson and Grenier now say that adding a limited echocardiogram — a two-dimensional image of the heart — can offer a more precise diagnosis.\n\nNational estimates are that roughly 1% of people are born with potentially life-threatening heart defects. But the Children\'s Hospital study is showing more than twice that rate and a higher rate for more minor abnormalities as well, perhaps because of better technology, Grenier says.\n\n""I do think they\'re real numbers,"" she says of the study\'s findings so far. ""Are they normal variations? What (abnormality) is going to contribute to the overall health versus something that just looks funny? That\'s not entirely known.""\n\nGrenier and her colleagues at the Heart Institute hope to continue this study — turn it into an ongoing program — so they may one day be able to answer those questions. In the meantime, screenings continue.\n\nMaking tests affordable, accessible\n\nA key challenge now is making these tests affordable; most medical insurance plans won\'t cover them. Currently, an EKG and echocardiogram would cost parents a minimum of $2,500, Anderson says.\n\nSimon\'s Fund, a non-profit organization, donated $5,000 to honor Cerda Navarro for screenings. Children\'s Hospital paid the rest, around $42,000, according to Children\'s spokesman Jim Feuer.\n\nIf an ongoing program of testing happens, the hospital would try to tap into third-party funding, donations and grants, Towbin says. ""The hope would be that with data, we could get the entire system interested in participating … get funding to run a clinical trial, locally and maybe nationally.""\n\nAfter Jordan\'s diagnosis, his family packed the room to support him for every subsequent appointment.\n\nHe now takes daily blood pressure medication and is allowed to jog and do other light physical activities.\n\n""He grew up around athletics, so I\'m sure it was a culture shock for him,"" says his grandfather, Lacey Calloway. ""Whatever he does, he knows we\'ve got his back, even if it\'s tiddlywinks.""\n\nSports teaches discipline, Gardner-Davis says, but her son is finding that in other interests. Jordan plays the drums in a high school concert band, is getting into photography and cars — now that he\'s 16. And he got a summer job at Great American Ballpark.\n\nGardner-Davis calls the decision to take him for that screening the ""best decision of my life"" and suggests other parents take advantage of the free service.\n\n""We\'re so thankful,"" she says. ""Otherwise, we\'d have no idea, and Jordan could be standing here one day and gone the next.""']","There is only one team on the field in this story about testing young athletes for heart problems. And in the Gannett family, USA Today simply picked up this Cincinnati Enquirer story and republished it on its website.","Based on interim results from an unfinished study, this story pole vaults to the conclusion that every teen should undergo expensive screening tests. Readers are given little background on the long debate about the effectiveness of such tests. At a time when sedentary lifestyles are a leading threat to health of young people, there is no consideration of the potential harm of labeling hundreds of thousands of teenagers as having “abnormal” hearts.

Now, a small pilot study suggests such a test could be developed.\n\nThe study, of 78 people with and without colon cancer, found that those with the disease tended to have a distinct pattern of chemicals in their breath. And when researchers analyzed the study participants\' breath samples, they correctly identified the colon cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nThe findings, reported online Dec. 5 in the British Journal of Surgery, sound good. But if you\'re waiting for your doctor to offer such a test, don\'t hold your breath.\n\n""It\'s an interesting concept, but this is in the very early stages,"" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colorectal cancers for the American Cancer Society.\n\n""There\'s no way to tell if this would work in the general population,"" said Brooks, who was not involved in the research.\n\nWhat\'s more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. Yet about 40 percent of Americans who should be getting screened are not.\n\n""Colon cancer is a highly preventable disease,"" Brooks said. ""And I would encourage the four out of 10 people who are not taking advantage of the existing screening tools to talk with their doctor.""\n\nThe idea of using a breath test to catch cancer is not new: Researchers are looking into breath tests for detecting a number of cancers, including lung and breast tumors. It\'s all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nWhen it comes to colon cancer, people already have several options for screening, which for most adults should begin at age 50 -- or possibly earlier if you are at higher-than-normal risk.\n\nThe choices include a yearly stool test that looks for hidden blood, or either of two invasive tests that scope the colon: sigmoidoscopy every five years, along with stool testing every three years; or colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nBut many people are turned off by those tests.\n\nSo Dr. Donato Altomare and colleagues at the University Aldo Moro in Bari, Italy, decided to test the feasibility of a breath test.\n\nAnalyzing breath samples from 37 patients with colon cancer and 41 healthy middle-aged adults, the researchers found 15 VOCs that seemed to differ between the two groups.\n\nThey then used a statistical model to see if certain VOC patterns separated the colon cancer patients from the healthy participants. In the end, the researchers were able to correctly identify the cancer patients 76 percent of the time.\n\nBut, Brooks pointed out, that also means the breath test was wrong about one-quarter of the time.\n\nThere\'s no way of knowing how well such a screening test would work in the real world -- including how many people might wrongly get a positive result and undergo needless invasive tests to follow up, Brooks said.\n\nAnother big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps.\n\n""One of our goals in screening is to detect polyps, not cancer,"" Brooks said. ""This study doesn\'t address that.""\n\nAltomare\'s team acknowledges that there is a lot of work left to do. It\'s still unclear which breath chemicals should be measured, or what statistical method is best for weeding out cases of colon cancer.\n\nBrooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests. Yearly stool tests are simple and cheap, but people often don\'t want to do them.\n\n""We\'re always searching for simpler things to do,"" Brooks said. But for now, he added, ""this study raises many more questions than answers.""\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about colon cancer from the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']",An informative take on the value of a new breath test for detecting colon cancer.

And, for unknown reasons, the U.S. rate of preterm delivery has been going up in recent years.\n\nThat\'s why it\'s a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK\'d a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem.\n\nNot a huge dent, but a significant one. The March of Dimes calculates that if all the women eligible to get the newly approved drug actually did, there would be 10,000 fewer preemies a year – out of more than half-a-million born that way.\n\n""Although that may seem like a small percent, it\'s really a very extraordinary ability to impact on what is really a major public health problem,"" Dr. Alan Fleischman, the March of Dimes medical director, told Shots.\n\nAccording to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth.\n\nThe drug is not for women whose prior premature births were of twins or other multiple births, or who are carrying more than one fetus in their current pregnancy. Nor is it for women who have other conditions that raise their risk of preterm birth, such as high blood pressure or infection.\n\nAnd even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn\'t a magic bullet. The study showed that 37 percent of women who got weekly injections of it delivered prematurely, compared to 55 percent of women who got injections of a placebo.\n\nInterestingly, the drug is not new — it\'s just taken a long and circuitous route to approval.\n\nIn 1956, the FDA approved 17-HP for the treatment of certain cancers and other hormonal disorders, under the brand name Delalutin. But its manufacturer withdrew it from the market in 2000 ""for reasons unrelated to safety,"" as the FDA puts it.\n\nIn fact, as a Federal Register posting last year chronicled, there have been questions raised about whether 17-HP caused birth defects of various kinds. In the 1970s, the FDA required warnings on drugs containing progesterone, as 17-HP does, because of an increased risk of birth defects. They later revoked them.\n\nThe FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it\'s requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy.\n\nEveryone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth – a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES. In 1971 researchers realized children exposed to DES in utero had a higher incidence of vaginal and breast cancers, and males were subsequently found to have urinary-tract problems.\n\nFleischman, the March of Dimes official, says there\'s no such risk from 17-HP, partly because it\'s not used before the 16th week of pregnancy, when fetal organs have already formed.\n\n""We have been very aggressively tracking all the data,"" Fleischman says, ""and we have no reason to believe that this drug will increase birth defects.""']","Cost was the only one of our 10 criteria not addressed by this solid, tight reporting on a new drug approval.","Given that 50% of care is covered by Medicaid and 49% by private payors, the costs for this drug are invisible to the individual. It is administered in clinic or by home health nurses and does not typically have a co-pay structure although patients will sometimes tell providers they can’t afford it.

The results so far are very promising.\n\n""Our data have shown that a concentrated formulation of adalimumab injected directly into the diseased tissue may be effective in targeting the cells responsible for Dupuytren\'s disease,"" said Jagdeep Nanchahal, MD, PhD, University of Oxford Professor of Hand, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, who led the study.\n\n""This brings new hope to people who suffer from this disabling condition, who currently have to wait for their situation to be deteriorate, watching their hand lose function until it is bad enough for surgery. And then there\'s the lengthy recovery ahead, a less than ideal situation to find yourself in.""\n\nThis randomised trial (phase 2a) recruited 28 patients with Dupuytren\'s disease who were scheduled to have surgery in Edinburgh to remove diseased tissue in their hand. Two weeks prior to surgery they received a single injection of varying doses of the anti-TNF drug, or placebo. The tissue removed during surgery, which is usually discarded, was then analysed in the laboratory. The team found that adalimumab (at a dose of 40mg formulated in 0.4ml) reduces expression of the fibrotic markers, -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and type I procollagen, at 2 weeks post injection, suggesting this drug could be used to stop the growth of disease causing myofibroblast cells. They also found the drug to be safe and well tolerated.\n\nThe findings are published on line in the journal EBioMedicine, published by The Lancet.\n\nDupuytren\'s disease is a common condition of the hand that affects 4% of the UK population and causes the fingers to curl irreversibly into the palm. There is currently no NICE approved treatment for early disease and typically people are told to return to their GP once their fingers become so bent that their hand function is impaired.\n\nThe anti-TNF drug adalimumab (Humira) is currently licensed in the EU for the treatment of a number of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\'s disease and ulcerative colitis and overall has an excellent safety profile.\n\n""We are delighted to have received further funding from the Wellcome Trust and Department of Health to test whether adalimumab will work for patients with early stage Dupuytren\'s disease,"" said Professor Sir Marc Feldmann, co-author and former director of the Kennedy Institute. In conjunction with Professor Sir Ravinder Maini, Sir Marc identified TNF as a therapeutic target in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n""The Kennedy Institute has a long history of successfully translating laboratory findings to the clinic\'"" said Professor Fiona Powrie, Director of the Institute. ""This type of work requires close collaboration between laboratory scientists, clinical trialists and clinician scientists over many years"".\n\nThe researchers are continuing to investigate the use of this drug to treat Dupuytren\'s disease in a phase 2b trial called the RIDD trial, which is currently running in Oxford and Edinburgh.\n\n###\n\nThe research was funded by the Health Innovation Challenge Fund which is a collaboration between the Wellcome Trust and the Department of Health. Funding for the drug was provided by 180 Therapeutics. The trial was run by the UKCRC accredited Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit (OCTRU), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford.']",Changes in surrogate markers don’t necessarily translate to better health outcomes affecting patient pain and quality of life.,"The headline of this news release promises “new hope” for patients with Depuytren’s disease: a disabling hand condition characterized by progressive contracting of the fingers into a clawlike deformity. The cause is unknown, the course of the disease is often gradually progressive, and there’s no curative treatment.
The study highlighted in the release only shows chemical changes over two weeks in 28 subjects. It can’t show (or promise) clinical improvements in patients’ hand deformities.
The key question for patients is: “will this therapy decrease the frequency or severity of the disabling finger contractures?” The news release doesn’t make it clear enough that the study looked at the level of genetic markers associated with myofibroblasts and that these markers (called “surrogate markers“) may not even affect how the disease progresses clinically.
The news release also falls short in discussing costs, potential harms, alternative nonsurgical treatments, and significant financial conflicts of interest among most of the study authors.
For the lead authors — who stand to benefit from patents related to this therapy — to dangle “new hope” at this very preliminary stage of laboratory research is premature and arguably irresponsible.

There is no cure for this disease and existing treatments just help alleviate some of the symptoms.\n\n“This is a big deal,” says Robert Beall, the president and CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. “The fact is it is obviously going to make a very big difference in the lives of patients.”\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes problems with the balance of salt going in and out of cells. A sticky mucus clogs organs, particularly the lungs and liver. It can also cause digestive problems. About 1,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the average person with the disease dies before age 40.\n\nIvacaftor works for people with the G551D mutation of cystic fibrosis. Konstan says that only about 4% of the people with the disease have this specific mutation. “It really is a major milestone in the treatment of cystic fibrosis,” he says. “Even thought it only affects a small percentage (of patients) the hope is there that we can finally do something about this disease.”\n\nThe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday, looked at 84 people who got the drug. Those taking ivacaftor saw improvements within two weeks, which continued for the nearly yearlong trial. Drug recipients could blow out more than 10% more air from their lungs compared with patients who were not taking the drug, and were about half as likely to have a “pulmonary exacerbation” or a worsening of their lung disease that often requires hospitalization. On average, patients taking the drug grew more and put on more weight than the placebo group, according to the study, and had lower sweat chloride – an indicator of the disease.\n\nBeall says the improved lung function helped patients double their ability to walk and one patient even started going the gym for the first time.\n\n“We have an incredible proof of concept,” Beall says. He points to other research under way with ivacaftor combined with another drug that could help people with the most common mutation of cystic fibrosis. That trial is ongoing and the treatment is at least four or five years away from approval, but if it works, Beall says, it could help 90% of the people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Pamela Davis, of Case Western University paraphrased Winston Churchill, “This study is also a great victory in the war against genetic diseases and marks the end of the beginning for the treatment of the cystic fibrosis defect.”\n\nIvacaftor has been submitted to the FDA for approval, and could be available next year, according to Konstan. When it goes on sale it will be sold under the brand name Kalydeco (pronounced kuh-LYE-deh-koh).']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The reporting of the basic facts is OK, but our criteria call for much more, and this story didn’t measure up on several. </span>","


More than 20 years after researchers identified the genetic mutation responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF), a treatment aimed at the cause of the disease, rather than its effects, has shown it can improve lung function and some other measures in patients with a rare form of the disease. While this story accurately reports key drug trial results and provides some context, it falls short in important ways by failing to note that there is not yet evidence the drug is safe for life-long use or can extend lives; and that it is unlikely to cure CF by itself. The story doesn’t tell readers that drug is likely to come with an extremely high price tag. It fails to note that the CF Foundation, whose CEO is prominently quoted touting the drug, has funded the drug’s development and may stand to profit from its sales.

Trust me – you really don’t want to know | Tim Lott Read more\n\nAbout half of all patients with depression get no benefit from antidepressants the first time they take them and they never work for one in three people.\n\nCurrently it is impossible to establish who should or should not be given antidepressants, or combinations of them. That means that patients are tried on a succession of different drugs for 12 weeks or more and experience prolonged periods of ineffective treatment because their medication does not benefit them.\n\nOne in six Britons will suffer depression at some point in their life. Last year 61.5m prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in England.\n\nResearchers focused on two independent clinical groups of depressed patients on two biological markers that measure inflammation of the blood, as heightened levels are associated with poor response to antidepressants. They found that blood test results above certain levels reliably predicted how well patients would respond to commonly prescribed antidepressants. Their findings have been reported in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\n“The identification of biomarkers that predict treatment response is crucial in reducing the social and economic burden of depression and improving quality of life for patients,” said Prof Carmine Pariante from KCL’s institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience.\n\n“This study provides a clinically suitable approach for personalising antidepressants therapy. Patients who have blood inflammation above a certain threshold could be directed towards earlier access to more assertive antidepressant strategies, including the addition of other antidepressants or anti-inflammatory drugs,” Pariante added.\n\nDr Cosmo Hallstrom, a spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Finding biological markers for depression (and other mental illnesses) has been the holy grail of biological psychiatry.\n\n“Such a finding and a test to back it up would be critical to advancing our understanding of the biological causes of depression. It would accelerate our therapeutic interventions and make them more tailored to the needs of the patient.”\n\nBut further clinical research is needed to see if the findings can be applied in a clinical setting, Hallstrom added.\n\nStephen Buckley, head of information at the mental health charity Mind, said: “We welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications that may work for people experiencing mental health problems. These initial findings are interesting, but, as with all areas of mental health, there is still more research to be done.”\n\nMental health problems, including depression, are estimated to cost £105bn a year in England. The World Health Organisation has predicted that by 2020 depression will be the second biggest cause of health problems in the world.']","This story puts forth sensational terms, even though it’s unclear when–or if–this research will ever be put into practice in a healthcare setting.","This story describes a British study published in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology that identified two biomarkers of blood inflammation that predict the probability of a patient responding to common antidepressants.
The King’s College London researchers suggest the findings may lead to a blood test to identify patients who could benefit from more aggressive treatment including combinations of antidepressants as well as antidepressants in tandem with anti-inflammatory drugs. The story states that scientists “have developed a blood test that could identify which people with depression will respond to treatment so that patients can avoid spending months taking antidepressants that do not help them.”
While the possibility of targeted therapy is exciting, and these results look promising, the story downplays the need for more research before such a blood test could be used for patient care. Nevertheless, it puts forth sensational terms such as “breakthrough” and “holy grail” to describe the findings.

Data found that the most common side effects are either eliminated or greatly reduced using image guided treatment. The study which was conducted at the Prostata Center of Offenbach, Germany (www.prostate-center.org) will be presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).\n\n""The patients we have treated at The Prostata Center have had their cancers destroyed without the need for surgery, with a low incidence of side effects and in most cases have been back on their feet the next day,"" said Dr. Michael K. Stehling, an internationally recognized expert on image guided tumor ablation treatments and primary author of the study. ""The data from this study confirms what we see every day, we have a very attractive approach for patients who are concerned about quality of life challenges and are considering options for the treatment of localized and late stage prostate cancer,"" he said.\n\nDr. Stehling has treated the most prostate cancer patients in the world using this image guided treatment, while generating the best therapeutic results. At the Prostata-Center which he founded in 2010, Stehling has treated hundreds of patients at every grade and stage of prostate cancer, and helped to advance the use of image guided treatment technologies. Dr. Stehling is a German Professor of Radiology, a former Associate Professor at Boston University and served as Research Assistant to Sir Peter Mansfield, Prof of Physics and Nobel Prize winner in Medicine in 2003 (for discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging).\n\nUnlike other treatment procedures for prostate cancer therapy, image guided or irreversible electroporation (IRE) only destroys cells; vital tissue structures are not affected, making IRE the first tissue-selective form of therapy. IRE uses strong electric fields that cause cells to die without exposing the tissue to radiation or heat. IRE is precision guided and reliably destroys cells within the treatment field, but important anatomical structures in and around the prostate such as nerves, the intestinal wall, the sphincter, veins and arteries are spared. Potential issues with erection and bladder control and other side effects are reduced while healing time is minimal, making it an ideal method for focal prostate cancer therapy and for men concerned about quality of life challenges.\n\nFor the study, Dr. Stehling and his team of researchers evaluated data from 265 patients with primary (stages T1-T4) and recurrent PCa after surgery, radiation therapy and HIFU. Initial tumor control was achieved in all patients, and during the follow-up period of up to 4 years, the recurrence rates were 0/55 (Gleason <7), 3/117 (Gleason 7) and 10/67 (Gleason >7). There were no IRE-related complications and toxicity was extremely low: 27 patients reported a transient reduction of erectile function (EF) (resolved after 6-8m), 15 a permanent reduction and 2 a permanent loss of EF.\n\nThroughout the study, there were no cases of IRE-related incontinence, even when the lower urinary sphincter was included in the treatment field. Incontinence is one of the most common adverse side effects of current treatments for localized prostate cancer and can have a substantial impact on the quality of life. The IRE treatment also had very low toxicity on the rectum and bladder, even in cases of advanced cancer infiltrating these structures in patients who were not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy anymore.\n\n""Treating prostate cancer with minimal pain and minimal risk of impotence and incontinence, even in patients with advanced and recurrent cancer, with a one-time, one-day treatment, until recently, was unthinkable,"" Dr. Stehling said. ""The cutting edge technology of IRE makes this a reality.""\n\nCo-Authors of the study include: E Guenther, DIPLPHYS; N Klein, MSc; S Zapf; D Kim, MD; B Rubinsky, PhD\n\nSOURCE The Prostata Center\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.prostate-center.org\n\n']",The headline vaguely touts this therapy as an “image guided” treatment alternative to surgery. What’s news about this research is that it involves neither surgery nor radiation but “irreversible electroporation” (IRE).,"There is much interest in the treatment world about the area of irreversible electroporation (IRE), which is a new way to damage cancer cells inside solid tumors, including prostate cancer tumors, by using an electric current. IRE, marketed as the NanoKnife, is a “new minimally invasive surgical technique that selectively kills tumor cells by using electrical fields to make holes in cell membranes,” according to Stony Brook School of Medicine which has begun using the method to treat certain types of pancreatic cancer. As exciting as the topic may be, this news release drops the ball on several levels. The Germany-based study claims to show that results from 265 patients showed fewer side effects with an image-guided IRE therapy for their prostate cancer than they would have had with other methods. But the claim is never backed up. Cost, valid evidence, alternatives and context are all missing from the release — hence the 1-star score.
Note: We’ve previously reviewed a different news release about the NanoKnife and covered the fascinating dispute that ensued between University of Louisville employees over the source of that news.

""If you\'re a kid and you have a food allergy, it\'s harder on you. You\'re missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.""\n\nMom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis\' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. ""We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,"" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.\n\nThe discovery was ""distressing,"" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in ""severe stomach cramps and vomiting,"" she said. ""Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.""\n\nGlover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was ""a gift,"" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help ""lots of other children.""\n\nThe risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.\n\nEllis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. ""It\'s been a huge success,"" her mother said.\n\nThe study results, published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology\'s Annual Scientific Meeting, prove that the treatment can protect some children against accidental exposure to or ingestion of a very small amount of peanuts or peanut products.\n\nNot a cure\n\nDr. Brian Vickery, the study\'s lead author, director of the Children\'s Healthcare of Atlanta Food Allergy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine, cautioned that ""it\'s not a cure.""\n\n""It does not make the allergy to go away,"" Vickery said. ""The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.""\n\nStill, that\'s no small accomplishment, he said. There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular, which, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more.\n\n""I\'m telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,"" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment\'s effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nHow the study worked\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 551 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 499 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\nThe treatment , which comes in powder-filled capsules, is an oral immunotherapy, and the concept is ""treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they\'re allergic to,"" Vickery said. Essentially, the treatment is a peanut powder.\n\nEllis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children\'s Hospital in Little Rock, which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones, a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children\'s Hospital.\n\nEllis and Monica Glover in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children\'s Hospital in Little Rock.\n\n""We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,"" Glover said. ""You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. ""\n\nThree-quarters of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an ""exit food challenge"": They ate, under a doctor\'s supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. ""It\'s intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,"" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. ""Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,"" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.\n\nErica Gibson, a registered nurse in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children\'s Hospital in Little Rock, and Ellis Glover.\n\nOnce, she felt her throat constrict, and ""it was harder for me to breathe,"" she said. She\'d gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. ""I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,"" she said.\n\nA little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.\n\n""These treatments really have the potential to transform people\'s lives,"" Vickery said, ""and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.""\n\nTrying to be \'bite safe\'\n\nDr. Scott Sicherer, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said the study is ""the largest of the phase three studies in pharmaceutical-grade peanut.""\n\n""It\'s what a lot of families call trying to be \'bite safe.\' it\'s not that you\'re curing the allergy; it\'s not that you\'re going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,"" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. ""It\'s really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn\'t have a reaction or the reaction wouldn\'t be so bad.""\n\nThough the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. ""This is not something to try at home,"" Sicherer said.\n\nAimmune has made peanut into a ""pharmaceutical-grade"" product, he said. ""Most people think of it as medicinalized food."" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you\'re getting, he said, ""and that\'s important because if you\'re reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don\'t want to have a mistake where you\'re suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.""\n\nAssuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, ""Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don\'t eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?""\n\nThere are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it\'s ""a commitment,"" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can\'t skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.\n\nGlover noted, ""It\'s somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner."" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.\n\nSicherer said, ""The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It\'s not easy."" It would still be worth it to many, he said.\n\nIf this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, ""that would be so amazing, because we haven\'t really had anything like that before,"" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health\'s weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n""It\'s not everything we would hope for, but it\'s still fantastic to be able to raise someone\'s threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,"" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: ""I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we\'re looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.""\n\nGlover acknowledges that ""it\'s not a perfect solution. I would say it\'s been some work to go through this study, just in terms of a time commitment."" Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: ""It\'s peace of mind.""\n\nEven though she dislikes the medicine\'s taste, Ellis also believes it is worth it. ""It\'s definitely better,"" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: ""You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them.""']",One girl’s story illustrates harms as well as benefits.,"This CNN News story describes a new treatment for kids with peanut allergy called AR101, which could help protect against severe reactions to small amounts of peanut ingestion. It’s one of two stories we reviewed about this important and newsworthy study. The other is from Fox News.
This report is appropriately cautious, emphasizing that the treatment is not a cure but reduces the threat from accidental exposure. In addition, the story details the commitment that treatment requires and the side effects that can occur. However, it could have done a better job by addressing the cost of this drug and giving the dropout rate of those on the treatment.

Although Anselmo\'s surgeon was able to surgically remove most of her tumor, she couldn\'t tolerate traditional chemotherapy that was the planned second step, and had to discontinue it.\n\ntoggle caption WNYC\n\nThe chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks.\n\nThe year before she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she\'d lost her son to suicide. Weeks after that she was almost killed in a car crash outside a local mall. Her cancer was discovered after she had a dizzy spell, and her husband, Joseph, insisted she return to the hospital to have it checked out.\n\nAfter all that, Anselmo and her husband weren\'t ready to give up on her cancer fight. He\'d read about advances in targeted therapies — drugs that go after cancer cells at the molecular level.\n\nThe family sent samples of her tumor samples for genetic testing to several leading cancer hospitals. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she was being treated, also did its own sequencing. They all found the same thing. Anselmo\'s tumor had a BRAF mutation common in skin cancer, but very unusual for a brain tumor.\n\nHer oncologist, David Hyman at Memorial Sloan Kettering, enrolled Anselmo into a new kind of drug trial. Called a basket trial, the study is designed to include people whose tumors have the same kind of genetic fingerprint regardless of where in the body the tumors are found.\n\nKnowing more about the genetic mutations of a tumor enables doctors to find a potentially effective drug much more quickly and accurately. ""It\'s like you\'re in a parking lot,"" Hyman says. ""And you have a key to one of the cars in the parking lot. And so one option is just to go to each car and try to open the lock. The other is to know that it\'s the third car on the right. What we\'re doing now is we\'re saying, OK, this key fits that lock. And we\'re only going straight to that car.""\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Kendall Messick Courtesy of Kendall Messick\n\nToday, Anselmo is doing well. She\'s been in the clinical trial for a year now, and continues to take Zelboraf (or vemurafenib generically) daily. The pills have kept her cancer from growing.\n\nThere are side effects, of course. She\'s lost some peripheral vision, though she\'s been able to compensate. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it\'s free to Anselmo because she\'s taking it as part of a study.\n\nNow she can focus again on the things she loves, like singing. Anselmo, a jazz singer who performed under the stage name Mariel Larsen before her illness, is planning a comeback. She\'s back in training with her longtime vocal coach.\n\nAs this kind of genetic sequencing of tumors has become faster and cheaper, more patients have access to this technology. More doctors are taking advantage of the information to treat patients with a targeted approach.\n\n""We took a disease where nothing really works for any length of time and we\'ve given her a year of life, and hopefully much more, where she\'s been much better,"" Hyman, her oncologist, says.\n\nStill, he cautions that the targeted treatments can\'t be considered cures. At some point the drug that is keeping Anselmo\'s cancer at bay could stop working. ""Every patient is different in how long it works,"" he says. ""We all have patients that have been on these drugs for years. But I don\'t know, I mean, I think if I was being honest eventually our expectation would be that it would stop working.""\n\nThere\'s no way to predict when. But in the meantime, patients like Anselmo are grateful to have time they wouldn\'t have had otherwise.\n\nAfter all the misfortunes she\'s been through, it would be easy to think Anselmo has been incredibly unlucky. But she doesn\'t see it that way. No, she says after rehearsing for her comeback show, ""I\'m the luckiest.""\n\nOur series is produced with member station WNYC, and with Ken Burns Presents: Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies, which will air on PBS starting March 30.

It does a nice job with this limited material, but taking a broader look at the evidence would’ve yielded a stronger, more useful story.","The article briefly recounts the story of MaryAnn Anselmo and her experience with genetic targeting to treat her glioblastoma. NPR’s story is a nice primer on genetic targeting for cancer treatment, and how it can, in some patients, prove more effective and tolerable than standard cancer treatments. By zeroing in on one mutation in one person, the reader gains an understanding of genetic targeting’s promise. However, by not mentioning other types of targetable mutations, or the associated costs, or the larger base of evidence that is relevant to this approach, the piece could give readers an overly simplistic and incomplete understanding of genetic targeting. There are, in fact, more than 300 genetic variations in solid tumors (e.g. brain cancer) known to have some response to targeted treatments–BRAF is only one of them–and the costs can vary astronomically, depending on the drug used. Some acknowledgment of that context, and the studies that have already investigated genetic targeting, would have strengthened the story considerably.

Up to 7 percent of deaths have been attributed to sitting alone.\n\n“Sitting is bad for our health, but it is a big part of daily life for many people,” said Horswill, an expert in exercise and metabolism in UIC’s College of Applied Health Sciences. “Exercise is a good way to counteract the negative effects of sitting, but just incorporating physical activity into one part of our day may not be enough to overcome the damage caused by prolonged sitting and an otherwise sedentary lifestyle.”\n\nBecause the workday is a major contributor to sedentary behavior, with more than 20 percent of workers in the U.S. reporting more than 8 hours each day, tactics that promote workstation activity have emerged in recent years, including standing desks, as well as dynamic pedal and treadmill workstations.\n\nHorswill and his colleagues compared the metabolic rate produced by three workstations: seated at a desk, seated at a desk equipped with a device that stimulates leg movement and standing at a desk. The device, which is commercially available, was a movable footrest, suspended from the underside of the desk, which enabled the feet to swing, twist or teeter.\n\nParticipants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit. On a second visit, researchers collected metabolic rate and heart rate data during three progressive stages: seated, seated with the device and standing. Each stage was 15 minutes.\n\nThe researchers found that modest movement while seated elevated the metabolic rate more than sitting and more than standing, by 17 and 7 percent respectively, and had no detrimental effect on cognitive function. The findings are published in WORK, a journal affiliated with the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists and endorsed by the International Ergonomics Association.\n\n“These results suggest that non-exercise active thermogenesis, which we call NEAT, can increase movement and calorie burning, and may have the potential to impact health,” said Horswill, the senior author on the study. “We expected to see the metabolic rate increase with each progressive stage, but instead found that metabolic rates from movement while seated were either equal to or higher than rates while standing.”\n\nHorswill says the study needs to be further validated, but that the findings should be especially applicable to individuals poised to benefit from NEAT but unable to access popular standing desks because of injury, disability or discomfort.\n\n“This is more evidence that NEAT, something everyone can do throughout the day, may be an important strategy for improving health, and even reducing early death,” said Horswill.\n\nHaley Scott and Danel Voorhees are co-authors on the paper.

This news release from the University of Illinois discusses new research from their faculty, which finds that moving your legs while seated at your desk may boost your metabolic rate more than working at a standing desk. Published in the journal Work, these results are surprising and intriguing, yet flaws in the study mean that the release may have been premature. Some red flags include the fact that measurements were only taken once from a very small sample size, and that funding for the research came from the parent company of a device that was found to be so effective. The device (described as “a movable footrest, suspended from the underside of the desk, which enabled the feet to swing, twist or teeter”) was compared with sitting still at a desk and standing at a desk. The release also gives the reader no frame of reference for interpreting the study results, leaving us with more questions than answers.

The medication, sold under the brand name Avodart, apparently caused small tumors to stop growing or even to shrink, researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA previous study found that a similar drug, finasteride, could also lower the risk of prostate tumors, but the new research -- conducted at 250 sites in 42 countries -- suggests that dutasteride is slightly more effective.\n\nThe new study “is further evidence that there is a role for these drugs in risk reduction,” said Dr. Jack Jacoub, a medical oncologist at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley who was not involved in the study. “If a patient understands all the issues [associated with the drug], I think it would be appropriate to provide it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Howard M. Sandler, an oncologist at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was even more emphatic: “The question might be, why isn’t every man taking one of these drugs? They help people urinate better by shrinking the prostate, they probably reduce baldness, and they reduce the risk of prostate cancer. There seems to be very little downside to them.”\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, which manufactures Avodart, said on Monday that it would apply to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to market the drug for risk reduction in men with high PSA levels -- a measure of prostate cancer risk -- a family history of the disease or other risk factors, such as ethnicity.\n\nBut because the drug is already available, doctors don’t need to wait for such permission to prescribe it as a preventive. Considering its low risk, that might be a safe option, experts said. Insurance companies are not likely to pay for it for that purpose, though, until the FDA approves it.\n\nBoth dutasteride and finasteride, sold by Merck & Co. Inc. under the brand name Proscar, are already approved for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, an enlargement of the prostate gland that causes urinary and other problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProstate tumors and BPH are driven by the male hormone dihydrotestosterone, which is produced from testosterone by two forms of an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. Proscar inhibits one form of the enzyme. Avodart inhibits both forms, especially the form that plays a more prominent role in prostate cancer, “and the expectation is that dutasteride would be a better drug,” said Dr. Gerald Andriole of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who headed the new study.\n\nThat proved to be the case, he said.\n\nAndriole and his colleagues enrolled 8,231 men, ages 50 to 75, who had elevated levels of PSA but no evidence of prostate tumors on a biopsy. Half received dutasteride daily for four years; half received a placebo. The men received biopsies two years after enrollment and again two years later.\n\nOf the 6,729 men who underwent biopsies, 659 taking dutasteride were diagnosed with prostate cancer (19.9%), compared with 858 men (25.1%) taking a placebo -- a 23% reduction. Among men with a family history of prostate cancer, the drug cut risk by 31.4%.\n\nThe risk reduction occurred primarily in tumors of moderate aggressiveness, the type that accounts for about 70% of all prostate tumors in the general population. That means that men “are less likely to be diagnosed with cancer that is not likely to kill them, so they are less likely to undergo aggressive treatment,” Andriole said. “That spares the anxiety of cancer diagnosis and the costs of treatment.”\n\nThe treatment also reduces BPH and its associated problems. A final benefit is that it reduces PSA levels and makes the assay a more sensitive indicator of tumors, a result that will be reported in a separate paper.\n\n“If the PSA level starts rising while a man is on this drug, that is a very strong signal that he has an aggressive tumor” and needs a biopsy, Andriole said.\n\nAbout 5% of the men developed sex-related side effects, including reduced libido, poor erections and complaints about ejaculation, similar to the proportion who suffered them when taking the drug for BPH. Those effects were all reversible if they stopped taking the drug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrice may also be a problem. According to GlaxoSmithKline, the wholesale cost of Avodart is $3.23 per pill. Finasteride is available in a generic form and is thus cheaper.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer in men after skin cancer, affecting 192,000 men per year and killing 27,000. Men who are concerned about their prostate cancer risk can calculate it at: https://deb.uthscsa.edu/URORiskCalc/Pages/uroriskcalc.jsp. The study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline; Andriole is a consultant to the company.\n\nthomas.maugh@latimes.com']",This story lacked the caveats and discussion of uncertainties that were a vital part of the WebMD story on the same study.,"This story just didn’t deliver vital context, analysis and independent perspect ive on this study.  Taking these drugs would not necessarily reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer–the ultimate goal of a prevention drug–because they appear to reduce the risk for only the moderately aggressive cancers.  Men could still develop and die from the more aggressive cancers, but chemoprevention would lead to substantial drug costs and subject men to treatment complications.

By contrast, two of those over 50 did, and late-stage polyps were almost twice as common in this age group.\n\nTo find a late-stage polyp, which may or may not turn into cancer, the researchers calculated they would have to test 23 of the people who were in their 50s.\n\nThat number was the same in younger people who had large waistlines, and even lower in those with metabolic syndrome, a combination of risk factors including belly fat, high blood pressure and high blood sugar.\n\n“It may be reasonable to offer colonoscopic screening to these individuals,” Dr. Sung Noh Hong and colleagues write in the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.\n\nOne gastroenterologist said the results were “important” but should not change practice.\n\n“This paper substantiates what we suspected, that people who are obese have higher risk of colon cancer,” Dr. John Allen, a colon cancer expert and a community practice counselor with the American Gastroenterological Association, told Reuters Health.\n\nAllen, of Minnesota Gastroenterology PA, said this risk factor might be taken into consideration when deciding when to screen, but that so far more studies were needed before recommending colonoscopy at younger ages.\n\nDuring colonoscopy, the doctor inserts a slim, flexible tube into the rectum. A camera at the tip shows the inside of the gut, so that unusual cell clumps can be found and removed.\n\nAt this point, colon cancer screening is only recommended by the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in people under 50 if a first-degree relative developed cancer at a young age.\n\nIn younger people, it is unclear that the benefits of screening offset the risks. During widely used colonoscopy, for instance, bleeding or perforation of the colon may happen in rare cases.\n\n“You want to make sure that the advantages are going to outweigh the harms,” said the American Cancer Society’s Smith.\n\nColonoscopy, used in millions of Americans every year, is just one of many methods to detect abnormalities. There are cheaper methods such as testing stool for blood, Dr. Michael L. LeFevre, of the University of Missouri in Columbia, told Reuters Health.\n\nLeFevre, a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed expert panel, said the chances that a polyp turns into cancer is currently a matter of debate. As a result, he said, it is hard to know whether removing polyps in younger people would in turn lower their risk of getting cancer.\n\n“If we back screening down to age 45, does that affect mortality?” he said. “From a task force perspective, this article alone would not prompt us to look at the screening guidelines.”\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/duh54n Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, online July 16, 2010.']","We’ve stated before that how you end a piece is important framing because it may be the take-home message readers remember.  This one ended appropriately, with a US Preventive Services Task Force member saying this study alone would not lead the task force to change its screening guidelines.","This story outlines both the potential benefits and drawbacks of screening clearly and concisely. It quotes several independent experts who provide valuable perspectives for the reader.

First author is Dipen Parekh, MD, of the University of Miami.\n\nLoyola is among 15 centers that participated in the nationwide trial of 350 patients, who were randomly assigned to undergo robotic surgery or open surgery to remove cancerous bladders.\n\nAfter two years, there was no significant difference between the two groups in survival without disease progression. Robotic surgery was associated with less blood loss and shorter hospital stays, but longer surgeries. There were no significant differences in complication rates or in patients\' quality of life. The study is called RAZOR (randomized open versus robotic cystectomy trial) and was funded by the National Cancer Institute.\n\nA robotic system allows a surgeon to perform operations through a few small incisions. Movements by the surgeon\'s hand or wrist are translated into highly precise movements of the surgical instruments. Every maneuver is directed by the surgeon, in real time, as the surgeon views a magnified, 3D, high-definition image of the surgical site.\n\nSince robotic surgery was introduced in 2000, it has spread rapidly and has been used in about four million surgeries worldwide. But apart from the RAZOR trial, there have been no prospective, randomized multicenter trials to assess how robotic surgery compares to open surgery in cancer survival.\n\nThe RAZOR trial found that two years after surgery, 72.3 percent of patients in the robotic surgery group were alive, with no disease progression and essentially cured, compared with 71.6 percent in the open surgery group. Sixty-seven percent of robotic surgery patients experienced adverse effects such as urinary tract infections and intestinal obstructions, compared with 69 percent in the open surgery group.\n\nRobotic surgery patients stayed a median of six days in the hospital, compared with seven days in the open surgery group. Robotic surgery patients lost less than half as much blood as open surgery patients, but spent more time in the operating room (seven hours, eight minutes compared with six hours, one minute).\n\nResearchers wrote that the findings ""underscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice.""\n\nDr. Gupta added that the study provides evidence demonstrating that the robotic approach performs at least as well as the open approach. ""It is important to conduct these trials before widespread adoption of technology, as has been the case with robotic prostatectomy (removal of the prostate),"" he said.\n\n###\n\nThe study is titled ""Robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer (RAZOR): an open-label, randomized, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.""\n\nBladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men, but it is less common in women. The American Cancer Society estimates this year there will be about 81,000 new cases in the United States, and about 17,000 people will die of the disease.\n\nThe standard surgical treatment of invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder). Three main techniques are used to replace the bladder: construct a new bladder (neobladder) from the patient\'s intestine; place a pouch inside the body to act as an artificial bladder; or place a bag outside the body to collect urine. Loyola Medicine offers both open and robotic radical cystectomy and all three bladder replacement techniques. There are pros and cons to each surgical technique, and Loyola physicians help patients decide which option best fits their lifestyle and health status.\n\nLoyola Medicine is nationally recognized for its expertise in diagnosing and treating a broad range of urologic conditions and providing integrated services for optimal patient care. Loyola\'s department of urology is ranked 39th in the country by U.S. News and World Report.']","While robotic surgery may be “not inferior” to standard therapy for bladder cancer, it does have added costs and a longer procedure time.","This news release about a trial that randomly assigned people with bladder cancer to either robot-assisted or open surgery buried the real news under a weak lead that garbles the findings. The news here is that, contrary to assertions of many proponents of robot-assisted surgery, it is possible to randomize patients in order to get a valuable comparison instead of relying on weaker study designs that can’t answer the fundamental question about how old and new techniques compare. The release is rated as satisfactory on many criteria because key information was included in the body of the release, but the headline proclaiming that robot surgery is “as effective” as open surgery misses the larger point. The headline and lead also put a pro-robot spin on the results, which could also be summarized as robot surgery is “not clearly worse.” Also not explained: robot-assisted surgery is more expensive.

And they can pick from a number of tests that have all been found to cut the risk of dying from colon cancer.\n\nAlong with stool tests — done once a year at home — the choices include two invasive procedures: colonoscopy done every 10 years and flexible sigmoidoscopy done every five years.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally supported expert panel, recommends that people at average risk of colon cancer choose any of the three methods.\n\nFOBT detects hidden blood in the stool, which can be a sign of colon cancer or pre-cancerous growths called polyps. Positive results on the screen prompt a follow-up colonoscopy to investigate the source of the blood.\n\nAdvances in the stool tests in recent years have made them more effective. A newer version called immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT) is supposed to zero in on colon growths better than an older version known as guaiac FOBT — which often picked up bleeding originating in the upper digestive tract, such as from a stomach ulcer.\n\nImmunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test. But there’s been surprisingly little evidence that it really is highly “specific” to colon cancer, according to Dr. Yi-Chia Lee of National Taiwan University Hospital, one of the researchers on the new study.\n\nSo for their study, the researchers followed nearly 2,800 adults who all volunteered to have iFOBT, a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy to check for problems in the upper digestive tract.\n\nThey found that of 28 people confirmed to have colon tumors after a colonoscopy, all but one had also a positive iFOBT result.\n\n“It means that almost every case with colon cancer can be identified by iFOBT,” Lee told Reuters Health in an email. “It is a strong support to iFOBT as an effective screening tool.”\n\nThe researchers also found that iFOBT had “specificity” for colon cancer of close to 90 percent, meaning the test would accurately give a negative result to almost 90 percent of people who did not have colon cancer.\n\nOf three study participants who were found to have cancers of the stomach or esophagus, for instance, none had a positive result on the iFOBT test.\n\nLike any screening test, iFOBT does have a risk of false-positive results, which leads to unnecessary invasive testing in some people. In this study, about 10 percent of all participants had a false-positive finding on the stool test.\n\nAmong the risk factors for false-positives the authors identified were the use of anticlotting drugs and low levels of the iron-rich molecule hemoglobin in the blood.\n\nIn practice, a positive iFOBT result would be followed by colonoscopy, in which a scope is used to investigate the interior of the colon.\n\nWhether used for first-line screening or as a follow-up, colonoscopy has the advantage of allowing doctors to spot and remove pre-cancerous growths called polyps — which means the test can prevent cases of colon cancer.\n\nBut as far as cutting the risk of death from colon cancer, stool testing is similarly effective, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nAnd it’s much cheaper: iFOBT is more expensive than the older stool tests, but it is still roughly $30. A screening colonoscopy averages around $3,000.\n\nThe downside of iFOBT being specific to colon tumors is that it is not useful for catching cancers of the stomach or throat.\n\nThat’s particularly important in Asia, where those cancers are common.\n\nLee said researchers there are looking into whether combining iFOBT with the older guaiac test is useful for catching cancers in the lower and upper digestive tract — and whether adding a third stool test, which looks for the ulcer-causing bacteria H. pylori, can help as well. Infection with H. pylori is associated with increased risks of stomach and throat cancers.\n\nIn the U.S., cancers of the upper digestive tract are relatively uncommon. The average American has a one in 200 chance of developing esophageal cancer, while the risk of stomach cancer is one in 114.\n\nIn contrast, Americans’ lifetime risk of colon cancer is about one in 19, according to the American Cancer Society. More than 50,000 Americans died of the disease in 2010.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/mUOj1 Canadian Medical Association Journal, online August 2, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This is an important story – and well executed – about an approach to colon cancer screening that arguably doesn’t get enough public attention. </span>","Maybe somebody is paying attention to our criteria checklist.

These high and low phases are often so extreme they interfere with everyday life and work.\n\nIn a telephone interview Churchill said that in tests, his team found that mice who were made manic with small doses of amphetamines were able to be calmed again with ebselen.\n\n“In mice, ebselen works like lithium,” Churchill said. “Now we urgently need to see if it works like lithium in people.”\n\nSome 60 years after it was first discovered, lithium - a mood stabiliser that can protect against both depression and mania, and reduce the risk of suicide - remains the most effective long-term treatment.\n\nBut it is very toxic - at only twice the right dose it could kill a patient, Churchill said - and its adverse side-effects mean many people stop taking the drug and relapse into episodes of mania and depression.\n\nChurchill worked with Sridhar Vasudevan to filter through a library of existing drugs - the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection - that are considered safe but do not currently have a proven use.\n\nThey screened the library for any drugs that blocked an enzyme that is key to lithium’s success and found ebselen was a possible lithium mimic.\n\n“This is one of the first handful of examples of drug repurposing, where a new use has been found for an existing drug,” Vasudevan said.\n\nEbselen is an antioxidant originally developed up to late stage, or phase III, clinical trials by the Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo for the treatment of stroke, but which never reached market and is now out of patent.\n\nVasudevan said his study, reported in the journal Nature Communications, showed ebselen had the same or similar action as lithium in the brains of mice, blocking the same enzyme.\n\nThe researchers are a now starting a small study in healthy human volunteers to look for effects on brain function. If that shows ebselen has similar effects to lithium, they plan to move to second stage trial in bipolar patients. (Editing by Pravin Char)']","It would have been helpful if the story had pursued the question about out how long it typically takes a lab discovery of this nature to go to market as an available treatment (if it proves effective in humans). Instead, a mouse study that was inadequately explained was headlined as if the “drug may help people.”","We wish that the story had quantified some of the benefits and side effects and that it had brought in some outside perspectives, which might have toned down the comment about “at only twice the right dose (lithium) could kill a patient.”  Also, adverse effects aren’t the only reason patients stop lithium.  Many stop because they enjoy the mania and don’t like the so-called “neutral” mood (absence of a depressive or manic cycle).

Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study.\n\n“Women with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures should not stop taking their treatment,” she told Reuters Health.\n\nBone drugs include Merck’s Fosamax, Roche’s Boniva, Novartis’s Reclast, and Warner Chilcott’s Actonel.\n\nSome 10 million Americans currently suffer from bone thinning, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The majority are postmenopausal women.\n\nPark-Wyllie and colleagues tapped into data on more than 205,000 Ontario women at least 68 years old who had taken the bone drugs. Their findings appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOverall, 716 women suffered the unusual type of thighbone fracture after starting the bone drugs, and nearly 10,000 had typical hip fractures.\n\nThe risk of a thighbone fracture differed depending on how long the women had been taking the medicine. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year.\n\nThat works out to nearly three times the risk of those who’d taken the drugs for roughly three months or less, after accounting for other risk factors.\n\nOn the other hand, longer treatment was tied to a 24-percent decrease in hip fractures, which along with wrist and spine fractures affect about half of all people with osteoporosis.\n\nThere are several alternative ways to treat osteoporosis, including hormone treatment for women. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health.\n\nSo far, however, the cheap and effective bisphosphonate bone drugs remain the most popular treatment option. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.\n\n“The bad news is that overstating the levels of risk of side effects with these drugs — which the media have been doing for some time now — has led people to stop the drugs when they should be taking them,” said Dr. Ethel S. Siris, who heads the Toni Stabile Osteoporosis Center at Columbia University in New York.\n\nApart from atypical fractures, the most serious side effect of the bone drugs is bone death, or osteonecrosis, of the jaw. But that’s a very rare problem, experts say, which only affects about one in 100,000 people on bisphosphonates.\n\n“If you’re taking the drugs and you’ve been on them for a while, but aren’t sure if you’re at high risk, you should ask your doctor about it,” Park-Wyllie advised.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal expert panel, recommends screening all women over 65 for osteoporosis.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/4HWZ7 JAMA/Journal of the American Medical Association, online February 22, 2011.']",Good job of reporting on a new study’s conclusion on the tradeoffs involved in the use of bisphosphonate drugs for osteporosis.,"Strong points:

REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\n\nThe study of 130,000 women in two communities in Sweden showed 30 percent fewer women in the screening group died of breast cancer and that this effect persisted year after year.\n\nNow, 29 years after the study began, the researchers found that the number of women saved from breast cancer goes up with each year of screening.\n\n“We’ve found that the longer we look, the more lives are saved,” Professor Stephen Duffy of Queen Mary, University of London, whose study was published in the journal Radiology, said in a statement.\n\nDr. Stamatia Destounis, a radiologist at Elizabeth Wende Breast Care in Rochester, New York, who was not involved in the study, said radiologists have been quoting results of the Swedish study for years and the new findings show breast cancer screening is “even more of a benefit than we understood.”\n\nShe said sweeping changes in the U.S. screening guidelines two years ago that scaled back recommendations on breast cancer screening caused a lot of confusion among doctors and patients about the benefits of mammograms.\n\n“We’ve had to do a lot of education of the patients and their doctors. This will help for that,” Destounis said.\n\nIn the study, women were divided into two groups, one that received an invitation to have breast cancer screening and another that received usual care.\n\nThe screening phase of the trial lasted about seven years. Women between 40 and 49 were screened every two years, and women 50 to 74 were screened roughly every three years.\n\n“Our results indicate that in 1,000 women screened for 10 years, three breast cancer deaths would be prevented,” Duffy said, adding that most of the deaths prevented would have occurred more than a decade after the screening had started.\n\n“This indicates that the long-term benefits of screening in terms of deaths prevented are more than double those often quoted for short-term follow-up.”\n\nThe new data adds to evidence on the long-term benefits of regular mammography screening.\n\nSCREENING CONTROVERSY\n\nNew breast screening recommendations issued in 2009 by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an influential advisory group, recommended against routine mammograms for women in their 40s and said women in their 50s should get mammograms every other year instead of every year.\n\nThe guidelines contradicted years of messages about the need for routine breast cancer screening starting at age 40, eliciting protests from breast cancer experts and advocacy groups who argued the recommendation for fewer screenings would confuse women and result in more deaths from breast cancer.\n\nThe changes were meant to spare women some of the worry and expense of extra tests needed to distinguish between cancer and harmless lumps. But the latest results from the Swedish study show the rate of false positive results was low.\n\n“We saw the actual number of overdiagnosed cases was really very small — less than 5 percent of the total,” Robert Smith, director of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society and one of the study’s authors, said in a telephone interview.\n\nMany groups, including the American Cancer Society, have stuck by their long-standing recommendations of a yearly breast exam for women starting at age 40, stressing that the breast X-rays have been proven to save lives by spotting tumors early, when they are most easily treated.\n\n“I think for anybody who was beginning to have their faith shaken in the value of mammography, these data show mammography is quite valuable as a public health approach to reducing deaths from breast cancer,” Smith said.\n\nDuffy said he thinks screening women 40 to 54 every 18 months and screening women 55 and older every two years would be a reasonable schedule.\n\nHe said the new findings do not speak to the frequency of screening issue, but they do make clear that screening works.\n\n“Everyone must make up their own mind, but certainly from combined results from all the screening trials, mammography in women aged 40-49 does reduce deaths from breast cancer,” he said.\n\nBreast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women, after lung cancer. It kills 500,000 people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to 1.3 million people around the world.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was a confusing story – confusing readers by evoking the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force controversy – and then never including a USPSTF response. </span>","This story reports on the results of a long-term Swedish study showing that 29 years after their first mammogram, women who were invited to get routine screening had a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality compared to those who received usual care.

(and then) we can have something ready to be introduced into the clinic,” he told Reuters in Nicosia.\n\nDown’s Syndrome is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation, occurring in 1 out of 700 live births worldwide.\n\nThe risk of having a baby with Down’s — which occurs when a child has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two — increases sharply as women get older. The risk for a 40-year-old mother is 16 times that for one who is 25.\n\nDoctors currently use a test known as amniocentesis to check whether a baby is likely to be born with Down’s. This test is generally done at about 15 or 16 weeks gestation and involves taking amniotic fluid from the mother by inserting a hollow needle into the uterus.\n\nSince amniocentesis carries a small risk of spontaneous miscarriage — Patsalis put it at around one or two percent — scientists have been looking for new less invasive ways to test for Down’s and other potential genetic problems.\n\nPatsalis’ method takes advantage of differences in the DNA methylation patterns — which are important to control levels of genes — between mother and fetus.\n\nIt involves taking a small amount of blood from the mother when she is between the 11th and 13th week of her pregnancy and detecting extra copies chromosome 21 in the fetus by analyzing the maternal blood.\n\nIn a small trial, Patsalis’ team were able to correctly diagnose 14 cases where there were extra copies of the chromosome, and 26 normal fetuses — results they said highlighted its clinical potential.\n\n“Such a non-invasive approach will avoid the risk of miscarriages of normal pregnancies caused by current, more invasive procedures,” the scientists wrote in their paper.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Weaker than the <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3699"" target=""_blank"">HealthDay story</a> we reviewed on the same study.  Our medical editor-reviewer wrote, “mind boggling to use the phrase ‘may soon be available’ on the basis of an early 40-person study.”</span>","This was a single-source story that didn’t adequately explain availability, costs, limitations of the evidence, or potential harms.

However, some researchers said, there are some complicating factors, both in the trial data and in other studies, that would favor Lucentis.\n\n“The data is going to be interpreted many different ways,’’ said one investigator in the trial, who spoke under condition of anonymity but would not provide any trial results. Revealing trial results before they are published or presented at a conference is considered a violation of scientific protocol.\n\nGenentech developed Lucentis to treat the wet form of age-related macular degeneration, the most common cause of severe vision loss in the elderly. While Avastin, which is a cancer drug, has not been approved for use in treating macular degeneration, it has the same mechanism of action as Lucentis. And Avastin costs only about $50 per injection into the eye, compared to roughly $2,000 for Lucentis.\n\nMany eye doctors already are using Avastin off-label to treat macular degeneration, and many say it appears to work just as well as Lucentis. But there has never been a definitive trial to compare the two drugs.\n\nSo the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, sponsored a randomized trial involving 1,200 patients. Results are scheduled to be presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The results will also be published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nSome 1.6 million Americans have advanced forms of age-related macular degeneration and the number is expected to increase as baby boomers age. In 2008, Medicare paid for 480,000 injections of Avastin to treat macular degeneration and 337,000 injections of Lucentis, according to a study led by Dr. Philip Rosenfeld of the University of Miami. Yet Medicare paid only $20 million for the Avastin compared to $537 million for the smaller number of Lucentis injections.\n\nInvestigators in the National Eye Institute trial had a day-long meeting on Tuesday in Chicago to learn the results. But they were sworn to secrecy.\n\nBut two people familiar with the data, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that injections of Lucentis and Avastin every four weeks resulted in vision changes after one year that were essentially the same.\n\nThe result was largely expected. Under the rules of the trial, patients treated with Avastin could read on average of up to five fewer letters on an eye chart than those treated with Lucentis and Avastin would still be considered “non-inferior.” It is believed the results were closer than five letters, however.\n\nStill, doctors will be looking closely at details of the data. One person said Avastin was less effective than Lucentis in decreasing the thickness of the retina, suggesting that Avastin might not prove as effective in preserving vision over a period beyond one year. Patients in the trial are being followed for a second year.\n\nSafety of the two drugs will also be closely watched. However, experts say that with only 1,200 patients, the trial will be able to detect only major differences in safety.\n\nAnother part of the trial compared injecting the drugs as needed, depending on the course of the patient’s disease, rather than on a strict monthly schedule. One source said Avastin was slightly inferior to Lucentis, but the other said the results of the two drugs were the same.\n\nThe trial comparing the two drugs is of the type known as a comparative effectiveness study. Such studies are being encouraged under the new health reform law, though this one started before the law was enacted.\n\nGenentech, which is owned by Roche, has already mounted a pre-emptive counterattack aimed at nullifying any results of the federal trial that would shift more patients to Avastin.\n\nThe company sponsored a study looking at records of nearly 78,000 Medicare recipients with age-related macular degeneration. The study found that those who received Avastin had an 11 percent higher risk of dying and a 57 percent higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke than those getting Lucentis, according to an abstract of the study posted on the Web site of the upcoming ophthalmology conference, where the results will be presented.\n\nGenentech arranged for the lead investigator of this study, Dr. Emily W. Gower of Johns Hopkins University, to brief Congressional staffers on the results on Tuesday.\n\nIf this finding is considered valid, it could render the results of the National Eye Institute trial somewhat moot by raising safety questions about Avastin.\n\n“Once you plant that seed of doubt in patients’ minds it’s very difficult to overcome that,’’ said one retina specialist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “I would say it changes the landscape.’’\n\nHowever, experts have not been able to scrutinize the data of this study. One obvious potential flaw is that people who get the cheaper Avastin are more likely to be poor and uninsured and might therefore have worse health to begin with than those who get Lucentis. The study tried to correct for this but whether it did so adequately is a subject of debate.\n\nRoche sells Lucentis in the United States and Novartis in other countries. Sales of the drug for each company were about $1.5 billion last year.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Don’t just read the star score for this story.  The real story here is one of “inside baseball” – and how journals, embargoes, industry interests and the drive to get scoops in journalism often rule the day.  So read the full review and how some other journalists reacted. </span>","This NYT blog piece broke the story of a trial of one company’s $50 drug versus its $2,000 drug for the same problem – age-related macular degeneration.

Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet.\n\nLomaira is the only strength of phentermine hydrochloride that can be taken up to three times a day before meals. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use.\n\n""At KVK Tech, we are committed to developing high-quality, FDA-approved medicines that address unmet medical needs, while ensuring affordable options for all appropriate patients. With Lomaira, we\'re giving physicians and patients access to a low-cost, low-dose version of a weight-reduction medicine, phentermine, that has been prescribed by physicians for over 50 years. Appropriate patients can take Lomaira up to three times a day, before meals – not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine,"" said Anthony Tabasso, President and Chief Executive Officer of KVK Tech. ""We developed Lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind.""\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride, an appetite suppressant, is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss. Over 7 million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals (HCPs), including obesity medicine specialists, family practitioners, endocrinologists, internists and cardiologists. 1\n\nPhentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast. The usual adult dose of Lomaira is one tablet three times a day 1/2 hour before meals. The butterfly-shaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose, enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weight-loss treatment plan to best meet each patient\'s needs. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.\n\nLomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle, despite the fact that two-thirds of Americans pay out-of-pocket for their weight-loss prescription medications. Through KVK Tech\'s Lomaira Lo-Cost Access Program , eligible patients will pay no more than 50¢ per tablet for the duration of treatment.\n\n""Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions. Many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weight-management plan. Now, the flexibility in dosing with Lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing. They can prescribe a lower dose, a good option for some patients. They can also prescribe up to three times a day, which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon,"" said Donna Ryan, MD. ""Regrettably, many patients are still not covered by insurance for weight-loss medications and the low cost for Lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option.""\n\nIn relatively short-term clinical trials, adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with ""anorectic"" drugs (appetite suppressants) lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 2\n\n""Even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health,"" continued Dr. Ryan. ""It is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit."" Losing five to 10 percent of total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.3\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. See Full Prescribing Information.\n\nLomaira is anticipated to be available by the end of September 2016.

Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), a rare fatal lung disease, has been reported in patients who had taken a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible association between phentermine use alone and PPH cannot be ruled out. Patients should report immediately if they experience any decrease in the amount of exercise that they can normally tolerate, shortness of breath, chest or heart pain, fainting or swelling in the lower legs.\n\nSerious heart valve problems or disease have been reported in patients taking a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine has not been established, therefore the possibility of an association between heart valve disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf your body becomes adjusted to the maximum dose of phentermine so that its effects are experienced less strongly, the maximum dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect.\n\nCaution is advised while engaging in potentially hazardous activity such as driving or operating machinery while taking phentermine. Phentermine has the potential to be abused. Keep Lomaira in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Using alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction.\n\nPhentermine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure, even if it\'s mild. If you are taking medicines for type 2 diabetes, your doctor may have to adjust these medicines while taking phentermine.\n\nSome side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine.

But a deep dive into just how it failed has provided a bit of encouragement to Biogen (BIIB) and the many companies still hoping to succeed where their rival fell short.\n\nLilly’s treatment, solanezumab, had no significant effect on the buildup of toxic brain plaques believed by many to be responsible for Alzheimer’s neuron-destroying effects. The company had already disclosed that the treatment failed to improve patients’ cognition and function, but the new data, released Thursday night, shed some important light on the underlying biology.']",This story wisely explains that there is still no scientific consensus that amyloid plaque is the right target for drugs that treat Alzheimer’s disease.,"This STAT story is a contextual view of not only the status of doomed scientific efforts so far to delay or halt Alzheimer’s dementia at its biological sources, but also of Big Pharma’s persistence at chasing an anti-amyloid cure.
The reporting makes the case that in the opinion of credible researchers, the reason for failures to date is that Lilly’s drug and others didn’t get to the amyloid when and where it needed to, not that amyloid isn’t the culprit. Although the article could have made the point sooner, it does state clearly that there is still no scientific consensus that amyloid plaque even IS the right target.

The story allows supporters to say that the new approach, which involves using extreme cold to destroy nerve tissue (a technique known as cryoablation), “could someday become a standard treatment” for PE. But the study discussed here doesn’t come close to the evidence needed to justify such a bold claim. The story also didn’t apply quite enough scrutiny to statistics regarding the prevalance of PE (which struck us as disease-mongering), nor did it explain whether the improvement in stamina reported by the researchers made a difference in the men’s sexual satisfaction – or that of their partners. Those significant concerns aside, we thought the story did a good job of explaining the nuts and bolts of how the procedure works. We also liked that it raised questions about the durability of the treatment and potential for long-term adverse effects.

When the urge returns, out comes another slap.\n\n\n\nNow imagine those ""slaps"" occurring inside the brain, protecting you in moments of weakness.\n\nIn a report published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stanford neuroscientists say they\'ve achieved this sort of mind-reading in binge-eating mice. They found a telltale pattern of brain activity that comes up seconds before the animals start to pig out — and delivering a quick zap to that part of the brain kept the mice from overindulging.\n\nWhether this strategy could block harmful impulses in people remains unclear. For now the path seems promising. The current study used a brain stimulation device already approved for hard-to-treat epilepsy. And based on the new findings, a clinical trial testing this off-the-shelf system for some forms of obesity could start as early as next summer, says Casey Halpern, the study\'s leader and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Stanford. He thinks the approach could also work for eating disorders and a range of other addictive or potentially life-threatening urges.\n\nAs a physician-researcher, Halpern specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical treatment in which battery-powered implants send electrical pulses to brain areas where signals go awry.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved DBS therapy for movement disorders such as Parkinson\'s disease, tremor and dystonia — usually in people who haven\'t responded well to medications. Occasionally DBS is a last-resort treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\n\nAnother study published Monday in PNAS suggests that DBS could help boost memory and other research is exploring its use for substance abuse and other reward-seeking behaviors.\n\nYears ago, the Stanford team developed a mouse model to test if DBS could curb overeating. Granted, mice don\'t normally gorge themselves. Yet if offered fattier, tastier chow each day for just an hour, within 10 days the mice realize if they ""don\'t eat this now, that guy\'s coming back to take it away,"" Halpern says. So the animals learn to binge.\n\nBut when the researchers applied DBS stimulation to a part of the brain\'s reward circuit known as the nucleus accumbens, the mice quit stuffing themselves.\n\nTrouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals\' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system — one that doesn\'t stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nIn 2013, the FDA approved a newer-generation device, known as a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS), that does just that. Implanted within the brain, it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area. The RNS system costs around $40,000. But with medical devices, Halpern says, hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery, if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is FDA approved. In the current study, Halpern and coworkers tested the RNS device in the binging mice.\n\nFirst, they looked for a biomarker — an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food. Next, the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a 10-second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. For comparison, other animals got continuous DBS stimulation or random pulses.\n\nThe intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols — and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction. It did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse.\n\nThe results point to a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior, says Dennis Turner, a Duke University neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an October review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers. ""That\'s the clear novelty.""\n\nFiguring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging. Few are willing to undergo brain surgery for the purpose of research. But Halpern had a rare opportunity. One of his patients developed OCD so debilitating that he opted for DBS. He agreed to have his brain recorded during the surgery. Since food isn\'t allowed in the operating room, the researchers monitored the patient\'s brain as he anticipated payoffs in a computerized money-making task. As reported in the PNAS paper, the characteristic anticipatory signal appeared when he expected to make $5 but not for smaller sums, suggesting some level of specificity.\n\nOf course, it\'s hard to conclude much from a single subject. But from other research ""we know it\'s safe to place an electrode in the nucleus accumbens, it\'s safe to stimulate it electrically, and we expect to be able to tune [the electrode] as we already do with DBS. So it seems like a nice opportunity,"" says Halpern, noting that addictive disorders haven\'t had new therapies for decades. ""I\'m motivated by the clinical need.""\n\nEsther Landhuis is a freelance science journalist in the San Francisco Bay Area. Follow her at @elandhuis.']","But, the story did a good job discussing costs and laying out the study design for readers.","This article describes some mouse and single-human-subject research at Stanford Medicine about an electrical brain stimulation device that is an offshoot of deep brain stimulation and that appears able to home in on and zap — in real time — the neuronal sudden urges and impulses that go rogue in a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens.
The story did a good job discussing costs and laying out the study design for readers. Also, although the article starts out by spending a lot of time speculating about human benefits, it does eventually make it clear that this is preliminary rodent research. One big gap of the story was not acknowledging that should this idea ever make it to market, it will indeed carry serious risks, including infection, strokes and device failure. Those serious risks (and the steep price tag) may outweigh the benefits.

However, for the first time, a clinical trial has revealed metformin can promote a patient\'s ability to repair their own damaged blood vessels by increasing vascular stem cells.\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of illness in diabetic patients, accounting for more than half of all fatalities. Metformin may be used to lower Type 1 diabetic patients\' risk of developing this complication.\n\nFindings of the clinical trial are published today in the journal, Cardiovascular Diabetology. This follows previous laboratory work at Newcastle University which explored the mechanism behind metformin.\n\nDr Jolanta Weaver, Senior Lecturer in Diabetes Medicine at Newcastle University and Honorary Consultant Diabetologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, led both studies.\n\nShe believes this new research is a major development in understanding the best ways to further improve treatment in Type 1 diabetes.\n\nDr Weaver said: ""As the outcomes of heart disease is worse in diabetic versus non-diabetic patients, there is a need to identify additional treatment options.\n\n""Metformin could routinely be used by patients with Type 1 diabetes to help lower their chances of developing heart disease, by increasing a repair mechanism created by vascular stem cells released from the bone marrow.\n\n""Our research is an exciting step forward as it may have positive clinical implications for patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease by improving their treatment options.\n\n""For the first time, this study has shown metformin has additional benefit beyond improving diabetes control when given to patients with relatively well controlled Type 1 diabetes.\n\n""We have established the drug increases patients own vascular stem cells, which will help delay or slowdown heart disease.\n\n""Our findings also show that the cells associated with damaged blood vessels were reduced, confirming that the repair of blood vessels was taking place in our patients.""\n\nResearchers studied a treatment group of 23 people aged 19-64 who had Type 1 diabetes for up to 23 years and had no evidence of heart disease.\n\nPatients were given metformin at a dose they could tolerate, between one to three tablets a day, for eight weeks. Participants were advised to adjust their insulin to keep blood glucose levels safe.\n\nScientists measured patients\' stem cells directly in the blood and also grew stem cells in a test tube, observing how they behaved. Another cell type was also counted to assess damaged blood vessels.\n\nThe participants were matched with nine patients within the same age bracket who took standard insulin treatment and 23 healthy non-diabetic people aged 20-64.\n\nExperts found that the stem cells of patients who took metformin were able to promote the repair of the blood vessels and there was an improvement in how vascular stem cells worked.\n\nType 1 diabetes is a lifelong autoimmune condition that develops when the pancreas does not produce any insulin, causing a person\'s blood sugar level to become too high. It is estimated around 400,000 people in the UK have the condition.\n\nDr Weaver said: ""We have shown that all our patients in the study had their insulin doses reduced after taking metformin and have not suffered any serious adverse effect.\n\n""Patients with Type 1 diabetes may wish to consider discussing with their GP the possibility of adding metformin, even at a very low dose, to the insulin that they are taking. However, care needs to be taken to adjust insulin dose to prevent too low glucose levels.""\n\nA pilot study was funded by Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation and the extended study was financially supported by the Diabetes Research Fund in Gateshead.\n\nDr Eleanor Kennedy, Research Manager at Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation, said: ""The Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation is delighted to have funded the initial pilot study that led Dr Weaver and her colleagues to conduct this small clinical trial.\n\n""The results, which indicate that metformin, a drug commonly used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, could also have a powerful effect in people with Type 1 diabetes is unexpected.\n\n""We hope that these results can lead to a much larger clinical trial.""\n\nCase study\n\nQuantity surveyor Alex Laws was part of the Newcastle University clinical trial and is delighted with the results of the study.\n\nThe 31-year-old, of Gateshead, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of just seven and has good control of her condition.

Based on a reduction in markers indicating blood vessel damage, and an increase in markers indicating blood vessel repair, the researchers conclude the risk is lowered, but the study wasn’t designed in a way that would show an actual risk reduction. Thus, claims such as this one by the study researchers — “this study has shown metformin has additional benefit beyond improving diabetes control when given to patients with relatively well controlled Type 1 diabetes” — represent an overreach, because the study wasn’t capable of showing a benefit on any outcome that would actually matter to a patient. Additionally, the release offers no numerical data on changes in levels of the measured markers — only general statements. Nor does it mention the cost of the drug, which is nominal, but which could garner a large sales market. Lastly, it offers a patient testimonial by way of anecdotal information which may or may not be representative of the experiences of others.

They are live microorganisms—or ""good"" bacteria—that when consumed in capsules or yogurt are said to confer a health benefit. So far, however, there is little scientific proof of their effectiveness—many studies of probiotics have involved less-than-rigorous research standards.\n\nAs further data become available, some researchers believe probiotics may evolve into prescription drugs, as doctors focus on specific bacteria strains to target patients\' particular conditions. At the moment, however, many experts say probiotics are misunderstood.\n\n""Consumers have shown to be willing to spend the money, just in case [probiotics] work,"" says Michael Fischbach, an assistant professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. ""What we all have to be careful about is to not view them as a panacea and to make sure that we don\'t raise our expectations too high.""\n\nActivia is one of a number of yogurts that contain probiotics. Dannon\n\nU.S. sales of probiotic supplements totaled nearly $770 million last year, up some 22% from the previous year, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm.\n\nThe strongest clinical studies have suggested some probiotics may be beneficial for certain gastrointestinal problems, allergies and vaginal infections. Many doctors recommend probiotics when patients are taking antibiotics. Probiotics are widely considered safe except for people with an impaired immune system, though experts recommend talking to a doctor first.\n\nFor other ailments, hundreds of probiotic studies are currently under way, experts say. In a report last month in the British Journal of Nutrition, researchers at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-School of Health Related Professions said a combination of two probiotics may reduce the symptoms and recovery time for the common cold. Other studies have shown similar results, especially with children.\n\nResearchers this month presented evidence at a meeting of the American Heart Association showing that two daily doses of a probiotic lowered bad cholesterol by nearly 12% and reduced total and saturated cholesterol esters which contribute to the hardening of arteries. The study was funded by Micropharma Ltd., a Canadian probiotic research and production company.\n\nSome studies have federal backing. UCSF is exploring possible effects of probiotics on infants and early markers of asthma, as well as on colic. Harvard Medical School researchers are studying what good bacteria might do for the immune system to see if the response to flu vaccine in elderly people can be improved.\n\nThe body contains trillions of bacteria, both good and bad. Most live in the gut but they also colonize other areas. Good bacteria help digest food, produce vitamins and protect from infections, among other things.\n\nThe Flora Inside Probiotics are \'good\' bacteria believed to confer health benefits.

Probiotics are largely unregulated but they can\'t make claims to cure or prevent a disease.\n\nThe community of bacteria, the body\'s intestinal flora, begins at birth, says Esi Lamousé-Smith, an instructor in medicine at Boston Children\'s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. By age 3 these bacteria, sometimes referred to as our gut or intestinal microbiome, are more or less set, she says. Each person\'s microbiome is distinct and doesn\'t change significantly with age unless a person becomes ill, takes an antibiotic or makes major changes in diet.\n\nA probiotic, which adds good bacteria only for the time it is being taken, seems to influence other bacteria already present. For example, it might stimulate other bacteria to turn on or off certain genes. These genes, in turn, might be involved in various functions, such as immune regulation or nutrient metabolism.\n\n""I am wholeheartedly a believer"" in probiotics, says Maureen Fitzgerald, a Germantown, Wis., resident who blogs about parenting issues.\n\nAs a former teacher, Ms. Fitzgerald was exposed to many germs and says she was looking for something to ""beef up"" her immune system. Once she started regularly taking probiotics she says she wasn\'t ""getting as many of the colds and the bugs that are around."" About five years ago, Ms. Fitzgerald\'s then 3-year-old son began taking a children\'s probiotic that cleared up digestion problems he was having. After that, Ms. Fitzgerald says she was hooked on the supplements. She raved about probiotics on her blog and has since received free samples, which she reviews.\n\nThere are many different strains of probiotics and each may affect the body differently. The dosage—or number of colony-forming units—in a probiotic is also important. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are the two most widely studied types of probiotics. Lactobacillus rhamnosus, widely known as LGG, may treat viral and antibiotic-induced diarrhea, and certain allergies, like childhood eczema. A strain of Lactobacillus reuteri has been shown to help with colic. Bifidobacterium animalis, found in some brands of yogurt, is said to improve digestion.\n\nExperts say taking a probiotic supplement with many bacterial strains isn\'t necessarily better. The key is ensuring each strain in a product is active and has been clinically proven to work at a certain dosage, they say. Tests done by ConsumerLab.com have shown that the number of living organisms in probiotics doesn\'t always reflect the label. Of 12 products tested this year, two delivered fewer organisms than listed.\n\nProbiotics aren\'t required to obtain Food and Drug Administration approval before being marketed. ""Right now they\'re considered a food product or dietary supplement, not a drug,"" says Gerard Mullin, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and author of ""The Inside Tract.""\n\nThere aren\'t any FDA approved health claims for probiotics, says Diane Hoffmann, a law professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law, who oversaw a study on the federal regulation of probiotics. But companies can make broader statements, called ""structure function"" claims. It is the difference between saying a product reduces the risk of heart disease versus supports a healthy heart. Because the difference isn\'t discernible to many consumers, there is little incentive in the industry to pursue costlier and more resource-intensive health claims.\n\n""Consumers just need to know that claims are not necessarily preapproved and they may not be well substantiated,"" says Ms. Hoffmann.\n\nIn the short term, experts recommend sticking with the strains of probiotics that have a lot of science behind them, like Lactobacillus GG, and brands that have proven to be safe and truthful in labeling.\n\nDr. Mullin, of Johns Hopkins, says the future may lie in concocting specific probiotics for people based upon their individual needs and microbiomes.\n\nWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com']",An extensive and well-written overview of some of the health claims that are being made about probiotics.

The researchers believe the DTI technique may expand the options for older women, who are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction.\n\nGood Results with DTI Breast Reconstruction in Women over 65\n\nDirect-to-implant breast reconstruction has emerged as a single-stage approach to immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy. So far, however, most studies of DTI have focused on younger women.\n\n""Half of all breast cancers occur in women over 65, yet only four to 14 percent of these women undergo reconstruction,"" Dr. Moreira and coauthors write. Most studies of breast reconstruction in older women have focused on multiple-step techniques such as tissue expander implant (TEI) reconstruction.\n\nThe researchers identified women over age 65 who underwent DTI reconstruction at the Cleveland Clinic between 2012 and 2015. They identified a total of 24 breasts reconstructed by DTI in 19 patients, all with at least 30 days\' follow-up and most with one year of follow-up\n\nPatient characteristics and outcomes were compared to those of 109 breasts with TEI reconstruction in 98 patients. The women undergoing DTI reconstruction were older (73.5 versus 69.2 years) and had a higher body mass index, compared to the TEI group.\n\nBoth DTI and TEI were safe and effective options for breast reconstruction. Complication rates were similar between groups, including blood and fluid collections (hematoma and seroma), infection, unplanned surgery, and failed reconstruction.\n\nHowever, DTI had some important advantages. Women in the DTI group were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital and spent fewer total days in the hospital. In the year after surgery was completed, women in the DTI group made an average of 6.5 office visits, compared to about 12 visits in the TEI group.\n\nThe DTI group also spent fewer days with a surgical drain in place: average about 13 days, compared to 23 days in the and had fewer total days in the hospital. That\'s an important consideration, as drains require antibiotic treatment to prevent infection, in addition to causing discomfort for the patient.\n\nThe authors note some important limitations of their study--particularly the fact that it was a review study of one hospital\'s experience with a relatively new procedure. Dr. Moreira and colleagues write, ""These reported cases include our learning curve patients as we familiarized ourselves with appropriate patient selection and surgical technique.""\n\nThe researchers emphasize that DTI isn\'t an option for every patient, depending on breast shape and other factors. Despite these limitations, their experience suggests that complications of the DTI approach in older women are similar to those of the more commonly used TEI technique.

The protection was seen for oral and pharyngeal cancer, but not for cancer of the larynx.\n\nDrinking less than five cups of coffee a day had a smaller but statistically significant protective effect: about 4% lower odds of mouth and throat cancer for each cup drunk daily.\n\nWas it the caffeine? Probably not. Though there weren't enough data on decaf drinkers to draw conclusions, drinking tea -- even massive quantities -- was not protective.\n\nGaleone and colleagues note that coffee contains more than a thousand chemicals. Some, such as cafestol and kahweol, have anti-cancer properties.

But experts said they were optimistic the results will hold up in the larger, longer-term trials already underway.\n\nWhat\'s most exciting, they said, is that the triple-drug approach could open up new options to nearly all cystic fibrosis patients.\n\n""This is not a cure for cystic fibrosis,"" stressed Dr. Steven Rowe, who led one of the trials. ""But it could be game-changing.""\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes persistent lung infections. Over time, extensive lung damage leads to respiratory failure. At one time, children with CF usually died before they reached school age. But with improved treatments, the typical life expectancy is now about 40 years, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n\nCystic fibrosis is caused by various mutations in a gene called CFTR. In the past several years, drugs that target those underlying genetics have become available. Known as CFTR modulators, they were heralded as a major advance in treating the disorder.\n\nHowever, they work well only for a small number of people with certain CFTR mutations, explained Rowe, director of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nThe most common mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is called F508del -- and it has proven tougher to tackle, Rowe said.\n\nAbout half of people with CF carry two copies of the mutation (one inherited from each parent). For them, a combination of two existing CFTR modulators can ease breathing problems -- but the overall effects are only ""modest,"" Rowe said.\n\nThen there\'s the 30 percent of CF patients who carry only one copy of F508del, plus another defect known as a ""minimal-function"" mutation. For them, the existing CFTR modulators do not work at all.\n\nBoth new trials focused on those two groups of patients. The results are published in the Oct. 18 New England Journal of Medicine, to coincide with the researchers\' presentation at a North American Cystic Fibrosis meeting, in Denver.\n\nRowe\'s team tested a combination of two available CFTR modulators -- tezacaftor and ivacaftor -- plus an experimental one, known as VX-659. The other trial used the same existing drugs, along with a similar new drug, dubbed VX-445.\n\nRowe\'s team randomly assigned 54 adults with cystic fibrosis to either take the triple-drug regimen or be in a comparison group. In the comparison group, patients with one F508del mutation took placebo pills, while patients with two copies of the mutation took tezacaftor and ivacaftor alone.\n\nAfter four weeks, the trial found, the triple-drug therapy had improved lung function in patients with both types of mutations. Their performance on a test called FEV1 rose by as much as 13 percentage points, on average -- what Rowe described as a ""pronounced improvement.""\n\nThe other trial had nearly identical results.\n\nThis is the first time, Rowe said, that CFTR modulator therapy has ""pushed the needle"" for patients with one F508del mutation.\n\nAn editorial published with the studies said they ""represent a major breakthrough.""\n\nNow the questions are whether the improved lung function can be sustained, and whether the drugs prevent symptom exacerbations and other complications, wrote Dr. Fernando Holguin, of the University of Colorado, Aurora.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing both experimental drugs.\n\n""The ability of these potential drugs to treat individuals with a single F508del mutation means that more people than ever before could benefit,"" said Dr. Michael Boyle, senior vice president for therapeutics at the foundation. ""This is very exciting news for our community.""\n\nRowe agreed there are still important questions about the triple-drug regimens. One is, how well do they work for younger patients?\n\nPatients as young as 12 are included in the larger ongoing trials, Rowe said.\n\nSo far, the treatments appear safe. Most side effects in the four-week trials were ""mild to moderate,"" the researchers said, and included cough, headache and increased sputum.\n\nIf the experimental drugs are ultimately approved, there will be the real-world issue of price.\n\nVertex currently markets the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor as Symdeko -- at a reported list price of $292,000 a year.\n\nIn the United States, more than 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis, according to the foundation.\n\nMore information\n\nFor an overview of cystic fibrosis, visit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.']","Thankfully, the story did mention the extremely steep cost of these drugs.","This story reports on two trials that showed adding adding one of two new drugs to standard therapy possibly improved short-term lung function in cystic fibrosis patients who fall into two common categories of gene mutations.
The story wisely included the high cost of some of these compounds, known as CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) modulators. However, the story did not give enough data to help readers make sense of the scope of the benefits. And while it did contain some caveats about the quality of evidence, those cautions were drowned out by numerous optimistic–and speculative–statements about how the drug will perform in future trials.

Unlike conventional methods of HIV prevention, such as condoms or anti-HIV drugs, the implant takes advantage of some people\'s natural immunity to the virus.\n\nHIV infects the body by corrupting T cells that are mobilized by the immune system when the virus enters a person\'s body. When the T cells stay resting and do not attempt to fight the virus they are not infected and the HIV virus is not transmitted between people. When the T cells stay resting, it\'s referred to as being immune quiescent.\n\n""We know that some drugs taken orally never make it to the vaginal tract, so this implant could provide a more reliable way to encourage T cells not to respond to infection and therefore more reliably and cheaply prevent transmission,"" said Emmanuel Ho, a professor in the School of Pharmacy at Waterloo. ""What we don\'t know yet is if this can be a stand-alone option for preventing HIV transmission or if it might be best used in conjunction with other prevention strategies. We aim to answer these questions with future research.""\n\nHo\'s implant was inspired by previous research involving sex workers in Kenya. In Kenya, Ho and research partner Keith Fowke of the University of Manitoba, observed that many of these women who had sex with HIV positive clients but did not contract the virus. They later found the women possessed T cells that were naturally immune quiescent.\n\n""Observing this, we asked ourselves if it was possible to pharmacologically induce immune quiescence with medication that was better assured of reaching the point of infection,"" said Ho. ""By delivering the medication exactly where it\'s needed, we hoped to increase the chances of inducing immune quiescence.""\n\nThe implant is composed of a hollow tube and two pliable arms to hold it in place. It contains hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which is disseminated slowly through the porous material of the tube and absorbed by the walls of the vaginal tract.\n\nThe implants were tested in an animal model and the team observed a significant reduction in T cell activation, meaning that the vaginal tract was demonstrating an immune quiescent state.\n\nThe article recently appeared in the Journal of Controlled Release.\n\n###']","The headline and text repeatedly imply the approach could “prevent women from getting HIV infection,” but saves the fact that the study is in rabbits for the very end.","This very brief news release about a University of Waterloo study looks at a medicated vaginal implant designed to diminish the T-cell immune response to HIV infection.  It’s based on previous observations which suggest that women who may be naturally resistant to HIV infection show low baseline T-cell activation in the vaginal wall. This so-called “immune quiescent” state can be achieved with the medication hydrochloroquine (HCQ) embedded in the implant which, in turn, is embedded in the vagina not unlike an IUD device.
Although the news release does a nice job of describing how the implant works as a medication delivery system, as well how the medicine affects T-cells and subsequently risk for HIV transmission, it falls short in several important ways.
First, even though the language repeatedly implies the approach could “prevent women from getting HIV infection,” it fails to mention the study is in rabbits and can make no claims of efficacy in humans.
Also, claims of efficacy, reliability, and affordability are not backed up with any data whatsoever from the study. There’s also no discussion of potential harms, or just how much more time or research is needed before this implant could be tested in humans.

Too much PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, only sometimes signals prostate cancer is brewing — it also can mean a benign enlarged prostate or an infection. And screening often detects small tumors that will prove too slow-growing to be deadly. Yet there\'s no sure way to tell in advance who needs aggressive therapy.\n\nOn the other hand, some men have cancer despite a ""normal"" PSA count of 4 or below. So for PSAs that are rising, yet still in the normal range, some guidelines urge doctors to consider a biopsy.\n\nHow quickly the PSA number rises is something ""that patients and doctors worry a lot about,"" said Dr. Andrew Vickers of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. ""Men show up here with a PSA of 2 and we say, \'Why are you here?\' And they say, \'Well, I used to be a 1 and my doctor\'s worried. Am I going to die?\'""\n\nSo Sloan-Kettering researchers studied whether considering PSA velocity adds value to the biopsy-or-not decision in those otherwise low-risk men — and concluded it doesn\'t.\n\n""This is a really important study,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley of the American Cancer Society, who wasn\'t part of the research. ""A lot of doctors are going to stop looking at a PSA rise of 1 and ordering biopsies.""\n\nVickers\' team tracked 5,519 men who\'d taken part in a huge prostate cancer prevention study and who\'d received a biopsy at the study\'s end regardless of their PSA level.\n\nJust having a rising PSA — if nothing else was considered — was associated with a slightly higher risk of having cancer, although not the more worrisome aggressive kind. But the PSA level alone, not its rise, was a much better predictor of a tumor, reported Vickers, a statistician who specializes in prostate cancer.\n\nFocusing on PSA\'s rise instead triggered many more biopsies, with close to 1 in 7 men who would get one, concluded the study, published Thursday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThat compares with 1 in 20 men who are biopsied for a high PSA level alone, noted Dr. Grace Lu-Yao of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in an accompanying editorial.\n\n""There\'s an important public health message here, which is for men not to worry about changes in their PSA if their overall PSA level is low,"" Vickers said.\n\nCopyright 2011 The Associated Press.

This test might help.\n\n""Those molecules will circulate in the blood for some time, they can be measured, and you can see the contributions from essentially every tissue in the body,"" senior investigator Stephen Quake told BuzzFeed News. ""When you are pregnant you can see the contribution from the placenta and the fetus,"" said Quake, a professor of bioengineering and applied physics at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\nBoth tests use cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which are snippets of genetic material released by cells when genes are active. They float around in the mother\'s bloodstream and can be picked up by blood tests.\n\nHowever, a new blood test — which is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab — can pick up on gene activity in the body that suggests a pregnancy is at risk for preterm delivery, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science . The researchers also found a similar type of blood test could determine gestational age, which is used to calculate the due date of the baby. Currently, gestational age is calculated in the first trimester using ultrasound, and it\'s not that accurate if used later in pregnancy.\n\nPregnancies are usually about 40 weeks, and a premature birth is when a baby arrives three or more weeks early. This happens in about 9% of all deliveries and it can be seriously risky for the infant ; they can have all kinds of complications, including lung problems, brain hemorrhages, and infections.\n\nThe scientists analyzed 20,000 genes to find the ones that were active during pregnancy and labor.\n\nThey identified seven cfRNAs that seemed to be associated with premature birth, and in a test of 38 women, they found that they could predict premature birth up to two months in advance.\n\nAll the women were at risk for premature labor because they had early contractions or a previous preterm delivery, and 13 did indeed go on to have a premature baby.\n\nIn a subgroup of women, the test accurately classified 4 of 5 preterm deliveries as being at-risk, and incorrectly suggested that 3 of 18 women who had a full-term pregnancy were at risk for early labor.\n\nIn a test of 31 healthy pregnant women, testing for nine cfRNAs seemed roughly as accurate as an ultrasound at measuring gestational age. An ultrasound has a 48% accuracy rate at predicting a due date that\'s within two weeks of a baby\'s actual birth, while the blood test was 45% accurate. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake.\n\n""It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,"" he said.\n\nThere\'s a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials. The studies were small and included only black or white women, but not other ethnicities. But the findings are promising, particularly because premature delivery is such a serious problem.\n\n""Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death, it’s a huge problem,"" Quake said. If doctors know someone is at risk for premature labor earlier in pregnancy, they might start efforts to help delay labor, such as recommending bed rest.\n\nQuake became interested in the problem in part because his first child was born almost a month premature. She\'s now a healthy 16-year-old. ""You realize, holy cow, that was a pretty risky thing that we had no control over and no sense that it was coming,"" he said.\n\n""We’d like to see a bunch of lives saved, that’s really the goal here,"" Quake said. ""There’s a lot of work left to do before we get to that point, but we are pretty energized and excited at this point.""\n\nThe study was funded by the March of Dimes and other nonprofit sources, although Quake and his colleagues have filed for a patent on the test.']","The story would have benefited from an outside expert weighing on the study and its potential ramifications and — more importantly — the potential harms of a false-positive test, which are not insignificant.","This BuzzFeed News story reports on early-stage research into an experimental blood test that aims to predict whether or not a pregnancy is at risk for premature birth. To determine that risk, the test looks for specific pieces of RNA generated by the baby that migrate into a mother’s bloodstream and which are associated with preterm deliveries. The story offers a short, readable, un-hyped, and eminently useful summary of the research, and it offers several comparisons to the standard alternative, which is an ultrasound scan.

All children required daily inhaled treatments to manage their asthma. During the study, caregivers used either acetaminophen (commonly known as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) whenever a child needed pain relief or had a fever. None of the study investigators, children, or caregivers knew which study drug each child was receiving.\n\nThe study did not detect any worsening of asthma in the children treated with acetaminophen compared with those receiving ibuprofen.

Compared to a news release by Boston Children’s Hospital, which we also reviewed, this release omitted quantitative data needed to back up its statements, especially those addressing benefits and harms such as no “significant differences in safety [found] between the two drugs.” As we had noted in previous news releases, the word “significant” here is supposed to mean “statistically significant” – a fact that’s often not clear. The University Hospitals news release also could have been more explicit in explaining the importance of the study, given its context. Finally, although the news release correctly points out that caregivers used either acetaminophen or ibuprofen, it suggests the brand names Tylenol and Advil/Motrin were given to participants, when researchers actually administered Little Fevers by Little Remedies and Children’s Advil.
A short discussion of costs would have been beneficial in the news release, since acetaminophen (Little Remedies) generally tends to be more expensive than ibuprofen (Children’s Advil).

In about half of patients with melanoma that has spread, tumor growth is caused by genetic mutations that keep the BRAF protein -- part of the MAPK cell growth pathway -- constantly activated. Drugs that inhibit BRAF activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about 90 percent of patients. But the response is temporary in most cases, and tumor growth resumes in six or seven months, the researchers explained.\n\nPrevious research suggested that this drug resistance develops because the MAPK pathway gets turned back on through activation of MEK, another protein that is part off the MAPK pathway.\n\n""We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy,"" study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release.\n\nThe phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs.\n\n""We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. In fact, the combination was at least twice as effective as BRAF inhibition alone,"" he said.\n\nOne expert agreed that the results were encouraging.\n\n""This study addresses the problem of resistance to the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway. This study combined dabrafenib [a selective BRAF inhibitor] and trametinib, [a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor]. These drugs can be safely combined, and the survival was significantly improved without untoward side effects,"" said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nThe study was conducted at 14 sites in the United States and Australia and included 162 patients who received different dose combinations of the drugs: two daily 150 milligram (mg) doses of dabrafenib plus one 2 mg dose of trametinib; the same dabrafenib dose with a 1 mg dose of trametinib; or treatment with dabrafenib alone.\n\nPatients who received dabrafenib alone were able to receive the full-dose combination treatment if their cancer resumed progression.\n\nTreatment with both combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib led to a four-month longer delay in drug resistance than treatment with dabrafenib alone. After one year of treatment, 41 percent of patients receiving the full-dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma, compared with 9 percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone.\n\nAmong patients receiving the combination treatment, the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs.\n\nThe study was scheduled for presentation Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Vienna and simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Cancer Society has more about melanoma.']",“Postponing resistance” is not the same as “prolonging survival” — something this story based on a press release never tried to explain.,"This was an inadequate story about a combination of experimental drugs to treat melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer.

At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy\'s missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.\n\nWyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.\n\n""His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,"" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.\n\nSo when a friend shared a story from the ""Today Show"" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.\n\n""He doesn\'t need this,"" she thought.\n\nHer fifth-grader had a different reaction: ""I want one of these robot arms!"" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. ""I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!""\n\nThere were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn\'t really thought about but he clearly had.\n\nFalardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.\n\nThe UCF team, which operates a nonprofit called Limbitless Solutions , is special because it\'s the only group in the 3-D volunteer network making electronic arms. Most 3-D arms are mechanical, which presents a challenge for children without elbows. With mechanical arms, the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow. The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep.\n\n""It\'s really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?"" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. ""It\'s just one problem after another we keep solving. That\'s what engineering is all about.""\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren\'t available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.\n\nThe UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.\n\n""My mother taught us that we\'re supposed to help change the world,"" Manero said at the time. ""We\'re supposed to help make it better.""\n\nThe students were blown away by what happened after that. The ""Today Show"" and other national news outlets featured stories about Alex and Manero, and then they got international attention. Families in more than 25 countries have asked the UCF students to help their children. In February, Microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world.\n\nEach electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school\'s manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.\n\nPetresky got involved with the design of Pring\'s hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.\n\n""He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,"" he said. ""I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.""\n\nEventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.\n\nPetresky says they ask every family about the child\'s favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can ""not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.""\n\nAs they\'ve designed the bionics, they\'ve learned that kids don\'t necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney\'s ""Frozen,"" and in Wyatt\'s case, the blue-skinned men from ""Blue Man Group."" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex\'s plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from ""Transformers.""\n\n""We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,"" Petresky said. ""There\'s a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.""\n\nThe team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.\n\nHe expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.\n\nHis mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.\n\n""The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can\'t buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,"" she wrote in her iReport. ""Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children.""\n\nAs they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can\'t wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm. And someday, he said, he wants to go to UCF and help other kids like him.']",Our reviewers didn’t want to seem heartless toward a story that profiles volunteers doing wonderful work. But they couldn’t find much useful information for someone who might actually need the services described in this story.,"This story is a “gee whiz, look at what these brainy college kids are up to” celebration of the charitable work of young engineers.

Bipolar disorder often is misdiagnosed as major depression. But while the symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder are similar to that of major depression, the treatments are different and often challenging for the physician. In bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, a patient swings between an emotional high (manic episode) and severe depression. Treatment for the depressed phase includes an antidepressant along with a safeguard such as a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic drug to prevent a switch to a manic episode. A physician who misdiagnoses bipolar disorder as major depression could inadvertently trigger a manic episode by prescribing an antidepressant without a safeguard mood stabilizing drug. The study found that heart rate variability, as measured by an electrocardiogram, indicated whether subjects had major depression or bipolar disorder. (Heart rate variability is a variation in the time interval between heartbeats.) The study, by senior author Angelos Halaris, MD, PhD and colleagues, was published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry. ""Having a noninvasive, easy-to-use and affordable test to differentiate between major depression and bipolar disorder would be a major breakthrough in both psychiatric and primary care practices,"" Dr. Halaris said. Dr. Halaris said further research is needed to confirm the study’s findings and determine their clinical significance. Dr. Halaris is a professor in Loyola\'s department of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences and medical director of adult psychiatry. Major depression is among the most common and severe health problems in the world. In the United States, at least 8 to 10 percent of the population suffers from major depression at any given time. While less common than major depression, bipolar disorder is a significant mental health problem, affecting an estimated 50 million people worldwide. The Loyola study enrolled 64 adults with major depression and 37 adults with bipolar disorder. All subjects underwent electrocardiograms at the start of the study. Each participant rested comfortably on an exam table while a three-lead electrocardiogram was attached to the chest. After the patient rested for 15 minutes, the electrocardiographic data were collected for 15 minutes. Using a special software package, researchers converted the electrocardiographic data into the components of heart rate variability. These data were further corrected with specialized software programs developed by study co-author Stephen W. Porges, PhD, of Indiana University\'s Kinsey Institute. In measuring heart rate variability, researchers computed what is known to cardiologists as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). At the baseline (beginning of the study), the subjects with major depression had significantly higher RSA than those with bipolar disorder. In a secondary finding, researchers found that patients with bipolar disorder had higher blood levels of inflammation biomarkers than patients with major depression. Inflammation occurs when the immune system revs up in response to a stressful condition such as bipolar disorder. The study is titled ""Low cardiac vagal tone index by heart rate variability differentiates bipolar from major depression."" In addition to Drs. Halaris and Porges, other co-authors are Brandon Hage, MD, a graduate of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine now at the University of Pittsburgh (first author); Stritch student Briana Britton; Loyola psychiatric resident David Daniels, MD; and Keri Heilman, PhD of the University of North Carolina.']","A “simple electrocardiogram” can help diagnose major depression or bipolar disorder, a Loyola Medicine news release claims, but where are the data to support this “groundbreaking” study?","A news release by Loyola Medicine covers what it called a “groundbreaking” study that measured heart rate variability to help differentiate between major depression and bipolar disorder. It adds this would be a “major breakthrough in psychiatric and primary care practices” — made possible by a “simple 15-minute electrocardiogram.”
We caution against the use of such language in a news release because medical research rarely uncovers earth-shattering, dramatic findings. This study is no different and is actually not the first of its kind. The news release also uses ambiguous terminology when revealing the study’s findings, such as the word “significant.”
Many details on the study design, including limitations and funding sources, are left out. There is no discussion of costs, and no data are given to back up the news release’s claims. It also would have been helpful to note how major depression and bipolar disorder are traditionally diagnosed.
The news release does a good job summarizing the profiles of both conditions, including the consequences of misdiagnosing bipolar disorder as major depression.

Your DNA Can Shed Some Light,"['Paxil or Prozac, Zoloft or Lexapro?\n\nWhen treating a patient suffering from depression, Brent Forester considers which anti-depressant to prescribe—ideally, one that will ease psychic pain without side effects.\n\nIt can be a tough call.\n\nDeciding “becomes somewhat of an art—and a lot of it is educated guesswork,” says Dr. Forester, chief of geriatric psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. He worries that sometimes psychiatrists “may think we are better than we really are” at making these choices.\n\nMcLean Hospital psychiatrists Brent Forester, left, and Ipsit Vahia, are occasionally using genomics to help inform decisions about prescribing anti-depressants. Photo: McLean Hospital\n\nThat may change as Dr. Forester and others enlist genomics, a form of precision medicine and an intriguing new frontier for the elusive science of the human psyche. Other branches of medicine, such as oncology, have embraced gene-based testing to help determine which cancer patients need chemotherapy or surgery. But psychiatrists typically haven’t let genomics guide treatment decisions, Dr. Forester says.\n\nOne test, called GeneSight, uses a genetic analysis of DNA samples from a cheek swab to help doctors figure out which drugs are likely to combat a patient’s depression. The test examines a dozen genes to determine how well the patient will metabolize certain drugs and how his or her brain will respond to them.\n\nSupplies and paperwork for a GeneSight test, which analyzes DNA samples from a cheek swab to help determine which drugs are likely to combat depression. Photo: Myriad Genetics\n\nThe test predicts the effects of more than 50 anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. Based on a patient’s results, drugs are categorized as ones to be avoided, ones that have some drawbacks and ones that can be used “as directed.”\n\nBarbara Dellovade, a retired real estate broker in Acton, Mass., became depressed last year. Ms. Dellovade, who is 78 years old, was taking an anti-depressant, but “I wasn’t reacting well to it and it wasn’t helping me at all.” She consulted Ipsit Vahia, a geriatric psychiatrist at McLean Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nMore The Food That Helps Battle Depression\n\nDr. Vahia told Ms. Dellovade about the genomics test, which retails for $1,500 and is covered by Medicare and some health plans. After receiving an analysis of Ms. Dellovade’s results, he switched her to a different anti-depressant and she began to respond in about six weeks, he says. Ms. Dellovade has been feeling better, she says, though “I am still not there.”\n\nDr. Vahia has been using the gene test more with his older depressed patients but says clinical judgment remains paramount in prescribing. “The brain...is the most complex organ in the body,” he says. “This is a small step, but it is an important step. We are adding a degree of precision” to treating depression.\n\nMcLean Hospital is one of 60 sites across the country that took part in a randomized trial of GeneSight. The results, which will be unveiled this week at the American Psychiatric Association meeting, showed that patients fared better when physicians chose a medication with the help of the test, rather than relying solely on their judgment.\n\nAmong the 1,167 patients in the trial, half took the GeneSight test and half were prescribed drugs based purely on their doctors’ clinical assessments. Genetics helps you “marry” a patient with the appropriate medication, says Bryan Dechairo, executive vice president for clinical development at Myriad Genetics, which funded the trial. Assurex Health, a subsidiary of Myriad Genetics, developed the GeneSight test.\n\nThe results were striking, according to doctors at several medical centers who participated in the trial. Patients were more likely to respond to anti-depressants when the gene test was used to determine which drug they should be on; researchers found a 30% greater response to the medicine when the test was applied. Every patient in the trial had been on at least one anti-depressant that failed to work, and some had been on several that failed.\n\nJohn Greden, the principal investigator in the GeneSight trial, is a psychiatrist and executive director of the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Depression Center. Photo: University of Michigan\n\nThe study shows that genetic tests can lead to better prescribing decisions, says John Greden, the principal investigator in the trial. Dr. Greden, a psychiatrist and executive director of the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Depression Center, says that until now, many doctors took the following approach: “My favorite anti-depressant is this one, so I will try it. Oh, that didn’t work, so I will try this one.”\n\nUnfortunately, he says, under that hit-or-miss method—albeit informed by training and experience—“fewer than 40% of patients achieve remission.” Every year, 16 million Americans suffer an episode of depression, he says, making pinpointed diagnoses essential.\n\nSome doctors took a while to come around to the GeneSight test. Charles DeBattista, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine, says initially he was “somewhat skeptical.”\n\n“Prior to the study I used it very rarely,” says Dr. DeBattista, who specializes in patients with treatment-resistant depression. He has been using the test more on patients who “have had problems tolerating medicine in the past,” he says. “There is nothing magical about it; it is not a substitute for clinical judgment.” But it does inform him what drug to try on a patient with serious depression.\n\nHis Stanford colleague Alan Schatzberg isn’t persuaded. The test “has some value,” says Dr. Schatzberg, a psychiatrist and a former president of the American Psychiatric Association. “It has some use but what it doesn’t do is tell you which specific drug to use.” He adds, “What the field really wants is a test that tells me which specific drug I should put my patient on.”\n\nThat is precisely what Charles Conway, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, likes about it. The test “provides recommendations,” Dr. Conway says. “It doesn’t say: ‘Give this drug only.’ It says: ‘You have a range of choices, which you will [make] based on your clinical judgment.’ ”']","But the story did not do enough to establish that the research is still preliminary — it has not been published nor peer-reviewed, and everyone is relying on just a little bit of data released by the company.","This Wall Street Journal article describes results of an unpublished, non-peer-reviewed study of a gene-based test designed to help physicians prescribe antidepressants in people with moderate-to-severe depression who have failed on at least one of the drugs.
The story, both in the narrative and in some quotes, adds some moderating context and healthy skepticism to the enthusiastic “landmark” claims from a company release. It also is clear about the cost ($1,500) of the test offered by Myriad Genetics. But it needed to examine more closely the fact that the test can’t really tell a psychiatrist or other physician which of the dozens of antidepressants may work best–only which are most likely to cause problems and should be avoided. If this is the case, what’s driving the (small) benefit? Is it because people whose treatment was guided by genetic testing experienced fewer side effects and therefore were more likely to adhere to treatment? We’re not told.

Only 1.5 percent had positive lymph nodes - indicating the rare possibility of metastatic cancer. And the only patients with positive lymph nodes had microinvasive tumors that were associated with relatively large non-invasive tumors (ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS).\n\n""These findings allow surgeons to select which patients with microinvasive tumors may actually benefit from lymph node sampling, while sparing other patients from this procedure,"" said Tamera Lillemoe, M.D, pathologist and a study co-author.\n\n###\n\nThe study, funded by Engelsma Family Foundation and Abbott Northwestern Hospital Foundation, was published recently in The Breast Journal, the official journal of the National Consortium of Breast Cancers.\n\nAbout Virginia Piper Cancer Institute® - Abbott Northwestern Hospital\n\nThe Virginia Piper Cancer Institute®, part of Allina Health, provides comprehensive care through all aspects of cancer prevention, early detection and treatment to help individuals maintain quality of life and find ways to live with and beyond cancer.

It remains a controversial surgical dilemma, in part, because some studies have found evidence of microinvasive cancer spreading to the lymph nodes 12.5% of the time, while this study, in particular, found the lowest incidence — just 1.5%. The authors conclude that, based on their findings, they believe microinvasive cancer is akin to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in that spread to the lymph nodes is rare.
The researchers conclude from the study that routine node sampling in microinvasive cancer is of questionable benefit.
The news release is very succinct in describing the findings of this small (under 300 patients) single-center study. Readers need more information before they can fairly weigh the researchers’ recommendation. For example, the release only notes that spread to the lymph nodes was found in patients with “relatively large” examples of DCIS, without clarifying what “fairly large” means; doesn’t note the average followup period for study participants, or what the outcomes were at the end of the study such as breast cancer recurrence, distant metastatic disease, or death from breast cancer. The release also does not mention if other tumor factors, such as hormone receptor status, were associated with spread to the lymph nodes.

The study, released on July 26, 2016, shows that patients with the most common form of brain tumor can be treated in an effective and substantially less toxic way by omitting a widely used portion of radiation therapy. These results will allow tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors to experience a better quality of life while maintaining the same length of life.\n\nAnthony L. Asher, MD, FACS, medical director at Carolinas HealthCare System\'s Neurosciences Institute and the senior author on the report, and as well as Stuart H. Burri, MD, chairman, department of radiation oncology at Levine Cancer Institute, began their research on this subject over 10 years ago in Charlotte, North Carolina. Along with Dr. Paul Brown at Mayo Clinic, they spearheaded an international, multi-institutional, randomized trial that will ultimately improve the standard of care for patients with a specific type of brain tumor, brain metastases, by reducing the toxicity of their treatment without reducing the effectiveness.\n\nTypical therapies for these types of brain tumors include surgery, whole brain radiation therapy and focused radiation, also known as stereotactic radiosurgery. ""We discovered that whole brain radiation added to focused radiation in the treatment of brain metastases – in other words, cancer that travels to the brain- reduces the number of new brain tumors over time; however, patients receiving the whole brain radiation had significantly more difficulties with memory and complex thinking than patients who only had the focused radiation,"" says Dr. Asher.\n\n""Whole brain radiation patients also reported worse quality of life compared with patients who only received the focused radiation,"" adds Dr. Burri. ""Interestingly, the data showed that the addition of whole brain radiation produced no improvement in survival.""\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, in 2016, there will be approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States. Almost one in four of those patients (about 400,000) will experience spread of their cancers to the brain. In contrast, 300,000 and 240,000 patients will be newly diagnosed with breast and primary lung cancers, respectively, each year. ""Brain metastases are not only extremely common, they are also a major source of disability in society,"" says Dr. Asher. Because of their location, these tumors often produce severe neurological symptoms, such as headaches, weakness or problems with speech and information processing, thereby compromising both daily function and quality of life in cancer patients.\n\nAccording to Dr. Asher, there are two primary objectives in cancer care:\n\nTo improve survivalTo maintain or improve quality of life for patients""The first and highest rule of medical care is \'do no harm,\'"" says Dr. Asher. ""Consistent with that obligation, when it isn\'t possible to extend survival with various therapies, it\'s absolutely essential that we work to reduce or eliminate any possibility that quality of life will be compromised by treatments. Another way to state that principle for cancer care, is that when two cancer therapies produce similar survival, it\'s important to understand which therapy offers patients a better quality of life.""\n\nIn this study, although whole brain radiation decreased the number of new brain tumors over time, its addition to focused radiation interestingly did not result in a survival benefit over focused radiation alone. Furthermore, whole brain therapy was associated with considerably worse quality of life.\n\n""In the past, clinicians who treated patients with brain tumors seldom used sophisticated techniques like neurocognitive tests to evaluate patients\' daily function in response to various therapies,"" said Dr. Burri. ""Without those tests, we might have incorrectly concluded that whole brain radiation was a better option for patients because it made their scans look better, at least in the short term. However, the data from our study shows that clinicians can no longer simply rely on the results of traditional lab tests or scans to assess the value of care; we have to understand the total impact of cancer therapies on our patients.""\n\nDrs. Asher and Burri emphasize that the real importance of this study is its potential to make us think differently about what really matters in cancer therapy.\n\nThe trial authors concluded that the benefit of adding whole brain radiation was outweighed by its risks in patients with one to three newly diagnosed brain metastases. This is a very relevant finding, as over 200,000 patients still receive whole brain radiation in the United States each year, and the majority of patients with brain metastases have a limited number (typically three or less) of brain lesions. Drs. Asher and Burri, along with their co-investigators, now recommend that patients with one to three brain metastases should no longer receive routine whole brain radiation therapy, and should be treated with focused therapy alone to better preserve cognitive function and quality of life.\n\n""Having the research published in JAMA is validation of more than a decade of work,"" says Dr. Burri. "" It is deeply satisfying to have developed an important scientific project, work in close collaboration with other investigators to obtain support from the National Cancer Institute, then carry the to carry the trial to completion with publication of impactful results in one of the leading medical journals in the world.""\n\nDrs. Asher and Burri are now working on a new method of focused therapy for tumors that have spread to the brain that combines radiation and surgery. The technique was pioneered at Levine Cancer Institute and they are looking to expand and further validate the approach with the National Cancer Institute.\n\nAbout Carolinas HealthCare System Carolinas HealthCare System (carolinashealthcare.org), one of the nation\'s leading and most innovative healthcare organizations, provides a full spectrum of healthcare and wellness programs throughout North and South Carolina.

The release doesn’t explain.,"A comparison of radiation treatments for some patients with metastatic brain tumors produced useful evidence that adding whole brain radiation to radiation focused on just the tumors was associated with more cognitive declines and lower quality of life, without adding to survival. That’s a noteworthy finding, but the news release obscures the advance in clinical evidence behind a flurry of superlatives, while leaving out important context. One bright spot is that the release highlights the finding that the patients given both whole brain and focused radiation had cleaner brain scans, but then did not live any longer. That’s an important reminder that disease progression tests do not necessarily point to better outcomes.
The study results, as the release notes, could help spare many patients from over-treatment. But rather than promising a “better quality of life,” the release would have done better to stick to a more sober portrayal, that the study supports recommendations updated in recent years against using whole brain radiation in these patients.

EVZIO is an intelligent Auto-injection system that provides simple, on-the-spot voice and visual guidance.\n\n""In Baltimore, we believe that naloxone should be a part of everyone\'s medicine cabinet and everyone\'s first aid kit. If we don\'t save lives today, there is no chance for a better tomorrow,"" said Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen. ""Having EVZIO available in Baltimore is helping us do everything possible to help prevent opioid overdose deaths in our community and across the country.""\n\n""The opioid epidemic is killing 79 people each day— the equivalent of a fully loaded 747 airplane crashing each and every week. We can\'t stand by and hope that things change on their own,"" said Spencer Williamson, President and CEO of kaléo. ""By empowering more patients to have access to this potentially life-saving medicine, we believe that EVZIO will help reduce the burden of opioid overdose in the United States. Since October 2014, we have received reports that EVZIO Auto-injectors have helped save an average of 14 lives per week.""\n\n""People at an overdose scene may be very emotional, so it really helps that EVZIO has audio instructions on how to administer this potentially life-saving medication,"" said Laurie Fugitt, RN, BSN, co-founder of Georgia Overdose Prevention. ""It has already helped save many, many lives in Georgia.""\n\n""The Cabell-Huntington Health Department is pleased to have EVZIO in our community,"" said Dr. Michael Kilkenny, Physician Director of the Cabell-Huntington Health Department in Huntington, West Virginia. ""Following initial deployment of EVZIO on February 3, we had a confirmed life saved on February 12th. Our community is in a crisis as a result of opioid overdoses and EVZIO has provided an outstanding tool to help combat the harmful effects and death resulting from heroin and opioid use.""\n\n""The Sarasota County Sheriff\'s Office (SCSO) has found the naloxone Auto-injector to be an outstanding addition to our first responder capabilities,"" said Captain Charlie Thorpe. ""Deputies now have instant access to this potentially life-saving tool since our field deployment in December 2015. Opioid overdoses continue to plague communities nation-wide. The SCSO recognizes this effective medical intervention as another way to help combat the opioid overdose threat to our community.""\n\nAbout Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) and Overdose\n\nOpioid emergencies, such as an accidental overdose, are a growing public health epidemic. On average, 79 people die from opioids, including prescription opioid analgesics and heroin, everyday in the United States; most occur outside of medical settings, such as in a home.[1],[2] Approximately 136,000 opioid overdose emergency department visits occur each year.[3] Many communities throughout the United States are facing a devastating heroin epidemic. Additionally, there are nearly two times the number of prescription opioid-related deaths as compared to heroin-related deaths.1 On average, 3,300 children five years old and younger are admitted to emergency departments each year due to accidental opioid exposure.[4]\n\nLife-threatening opioid emergencies result in respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) is the most important serious adverse effect of opioids as it can be immediately life-threatening.[5] In addition to the risk of an opioid overdose associated with an opioid use disorder, there may be an increased risk of life-threatening OIRD even when patients take a prescribed dose of an opioid as directed. For example, taking high doses of opioids, taking an opioid in combination with other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) or alcohol, or if there is a history of certain medical conditions (e.g., COPD, severe asthma) places individuals at significantly higher risk for life-threatening OIRD.[6],[7],[8] Seconds count when a life-threatening OIRD event occurs. Without rapid intervention, brain injury or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes.[9] Most life-threatening OIRD emergencies occur in the home and are witnessed by family and friends who may be in the best position to intervene quickly.[10]\n\nNaloxone is an opioid antagonist that displaces opioids from the receptors in the brain, temporarily reversing the life-threatening breathing problems that can occur during an opioid emergency.[11]\n\nAbout EVZIO (EVV-zee-oh)\n\nEVZIO (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-injector is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. EVZIO is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present. EVZIO is not a substitute for emergency medical care. EVZIO is an intelligent Auto-injection system that provides simple, on-the-spot voice and visual guidance. EVZIO is small, easy-to-carry and easy-to-use to help patients and caregivers keep it on hand so they can take fast, confident action administering EVZIO during an opioid emergency. Results averaged across two adequate and well-controlled usability studies demonstrate more than 94% of users can correctly administer EVZIO without training, and 100% with training.[12] Each EVZIO pre-filled, single-use, hand-held Auto-injector delivers a single 0.4 mg dose of naloxone. Each EVZIO prescription comes with two Auto-injectors and a Trainer.

Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. Excessive doses of naloxone hydrochloride in postoperative patients have resulted in significant reversal of analgesia and have caused agitation.\n\nAbrupt reversal of opioid effects in persons who were physically dependent on opioids has precipitated signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal including: body aches, fever, sweating, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, yawning, weakness, shivering or trembling, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, increased blood pressure, and tachycardia. In the neonate, opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms also included: convulsions, excessive crying, and hyperactive reflexes.\n\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

The release uses testimonial quotes from an impressive array of public health and safety officials. Unfortunately, it provides no hard data backing up its benefits. Not even its attention-grabbing headline — “More than 1000 Lives Reported Saved with Help of EZVIO” — is backed up with a source.

story_reviews_01014,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/4254/,2011-08-24 11:00:00,Certain foods may be the best medicine for lowering ‘bad’ cholesterol,"['For patients with high levels of so-called bad cholesterol, doctors routinely reach for two remedies: cholesterol-lowering statin drugs and a diet that cuts out foods high in saturated fat, such as ice cream, red meat and butter.\n\nBut new research has found that when it comes to lowering artery-clogging cholesterol, what you eat may be more important than what you don’t eat.\n\nReleased online Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., the study found that incorporating several cholesterol-lowering foods — such as soy protein and nuts — into a diet can reduce bad cholesterol far more effectively than a diet low in saturated fat.\n\nIn fact, the authors assert, levels of LDL, the “bad” cholesterol, can drop to half that seen by many patients who take statins, sold under such names as Lipitor, Crestor or Zocor. That could drive down a person’s risk of fatal heart attack or stroke by 10%, the authors suggested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this doesn’t mean that people on statins should go dump their drugs for tofu, said Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Dr. Steve Nissen, who was not involved in the study. Dietary changes do not have nearly the research track record that statins have racked up for heart attack prevention, he said.\n\n“Patients don’t want to take the medications, and I’m afraid that if you tell them there’s a diet that works just as well, then they’ll do that instead,” he said.\n\nNearly 1 in 6 Americans has a high overall cholesterol level, which makes a person nearly twice as likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke as someone whose total cholesterol falls into a healthy range. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is one component of this overall number.\n\nLast year, statin and other lipid-regulating drugs were the nation’s most commonly prescribed medications, with more than 355 million prescriptions dispensed, according to the healthcare information firm IMS Health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multi-center Canadian study tested a diet that contained a portfolio of cholesterol-fighting foods such as soy protein, nuts, “sticky” fiber such as that found in oats and barley, and plant sterols. Subjects were instructed to eat a handful of nuts such as almonds or walnuts every day, and to substitute milk and meats with soy and tofu products as much as possible.\n\nOne of the most potent cholesterol-busters in that mix, plant sterols (sometimes called stanols), occurs in small amounts in many grains, nuts, vegetables, legumes and fruits and also can be added to foods or taken as a dietary supplement. Plant sterols mimic LDL cholesterol particles in the gut, preventing the absorption of those particles so that they pass through the body and are disposed of as waste.\n\nThe 345 subjects in the study, which was coordinated by a team based at St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, all suffered high cholesterol levels and were considered at elevated risk of coronary heart disease. The subjects each followed one of three diets: an “intensive portfolio” diet, a “routine portfolio” diet, or a high-fiber, low-saturated-fat diet rich in produce and whole grains, which is commonly recommended to those who have had had a heart attack or need to lower their cholesterol.\n\nAmong the 267 subjects who completed the trial, all three groups lost roughly an equal amount of weight — between about 2 pounds 10 ounces and 3 pounds 12 ounces — after six months. But those on one of the portfolio diets — intensive or routine — saw their LDL cholesterol levels decline between 13.1% and 13.8% after six months.\n\nSubjects on the low-saturated-fat diet had, on average, a 3% reduction in their LDL cholesterol in the same period.\n\nDr. Walter Willett, a nutrition and health expert at Harvard University’s School of Public Health who was not involved in the study, said that the trial was “nicely done” and that it underscored the fact that “just focusing on reducing saturated and total fat is not the most effective diet for reducing heart disease risk factors or heart disease itself.”\n\nThe authors acknowledged that the components in the portfolio diet were well-known for their cholesterol-busting properties. But their research is the first to test the relative effects of those dietary interventions in a real-world comparison, and to gauge how readily people can understand and implement such a diet in everyday life.\n\nIt was pretty easily done, the scientists found. Subjects in the intensive group got as many as seven sessions of instruction and guidance, while those in the routine group got one 60-minute session plus a 40-minute refresher — but both groups realized roughly equal benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers also found that the greater a subject’s adherence to the portfolio diet, the more dramatic, on average, was the LDL cholesterol reduction.\n\nBut Cleveland Clinic’s Nissen stressed that researchers did not directly measure rates of coronary heart disease — just LDL cholesterol — so the health effects of the portfolio diet are not yet clear.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">There were some strong points to this story.  Unfortunately, they were matched by some pretty important weaknesses.  Read on for details.</span>","This story was about a study comparing a special vegetarian diet containing a “portfolio” of cholesterol-lowering foods (e.g. nuts, soy, margarines fortified with plant sterols) with standard dietary advice for preventing heart disease (e.g. cut out saturated fat). There was plenty to like about this story, including comments from two excellent independent sources which added valuable context to the piece. The story also makes the very important point that this study looked only at a surrogate marker of heart disease risk, LDL cholesterol, and not actual heart disease outcomes. But the story didn’t provide crucial information about costs or availability of the diet components and it didn’t fairly describe how difficult it would be for most people to maintain this kind of diet. These mistakes are compounded by a glaring misinterpretation of the study which is trumpeted in the headline — i.e. that the diet tested in the study lowered LDL cholesterol “more than statin drugs.”

The new study, which only involved 28 patients, is modest fillip.\n\n“It demonstrated that the drug has an effect on the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease,” lead researcher Juha Rinne from Finland’s University of Turku told Reuters.\n\nRinne and colleagues used a novel imaging substance called carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B, which sticks to areas of the brain where there is a lot of beta amyloid plaque.\n\nAfter 78 weeks, they found that patients given bapineuzumab had about a 25 percent reduction in plaque compared with those on placebo. The effect was similar with three different doses of the drug, they reported in the journal Lancet Neurology.\n\nThe treatment was generally well tolerated, although two patients on the highest dose had transient brain swelling. The drug’s developers have since dropped the top dose from large ongoing Phase III trials.\n\nCommenting on the results, Sam Gandy from New York’s Mount Sinai School of Medicine said it was too early to say effective disease-modifying drugs were at hand, but the ability to measure plaque in living subjects was “something of a breakthrough”.\n\nExperts are divided on the root cause of Alzheimer’s and hence the best way to tackle it.\n\nMost advanced drugs, like bapineuzumab, have focused on removing clumps of amyloid plaques, which are thought to stop brain cells from functioning properly. But a rival school blames toxic tangles caused by an abnormal build-up of the protein tau.\n\nRinne’s imaging study was funded by Elan and Wyeth, which is now part of Pfizer. (Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)']","This story trumpeted a very small study tracking brain plaque changes through a new imaging technology but without any discussion of impact on peoples’ lives.  When it comes to Alzheimer’s Disease, that’s an important omission.

Though it is gratifying to hear the patient’s words and the hope that this treatment has provided him, it actually isn’t clear whether the hyperbaric oxygen itself was the reason he got better. The “placebo” effect is well described in the medical literature and refers to sham treatments (fake surgery or pills) leading to benefit. It may also be that the treatment really did help but not for the reasons cited–maybe simply sitting still for hours helped tissues to heal.

Now, the field includes a slew of new drinks promising a better night\'s sleep using such ingredients as melatonin, valerian root and - think turkey - tryptophan.\n\nThey have apt names such as Unwind, iChill and Dream Water, and offer such flavors as Berry-Berry Tired, Snoozeberry and Lullaby Lemon. They\'re the inverse of energy drinks. Consumers can wake up with Red Bull and then wind down with Slow Cow.\n\nBut can consumers trust these fruity concoctions to give them their z\'s?\n\nAccording to Steven M. Scharf, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, the answer is a resounding maybe.\n\n""The issue is this: Some of them probably have some biologic effect, but they haven\'t been as well studied as you\'d like,"" Scharf says. ""Nobody\'s ever compared valerian root to [the prescription sleep aid] Ambien.""\n\nThe chief ingredient in many of these beverages is melatonin, a hormone that induces sleepiness and helps coordinate the body\'s biological clock. It\'s typically released by the pineal gland around 10 p.m.; secretion stops around 4 or 5 a.m., helping to trigger the body to wake up, Scharf says.\n\nThe body produces about three-fourths of a milligram of melatonin a day. The manufacturer of the sleep aid Snooz\'n says its 2.5-ounce ""shots"" contain five milligrams of melatonin; Unwind, a ""relaxation blend,"" has three milligrams per 12-ounce can.\n\nOral doses of melatonin haven\'t worked much better at inducing sleep than a placebo in most studies, Scharf says, and a single, concentrated shot of the stuff doesn\'t exactly mimic the body\'s time-release system. However, a study published in January in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that a pre-bedtime cocktail of magnesium, zinc and a five-milligram dose of melatonin significantly improved sleep among a group of 43 elderly Italian insomniacs.\n\nJason Healy, the head of InterMark Brands, which markets Snooz\'n, says he drinks his product on nights when he is stressed-out or when he is traveling internationally. The back of the Snooz\'n bottle says the beverage will ""combat stress, energy drinks and sleeplessness"" and takes about 30 minutes to take effect. When it launches nationally in March, Snooz\'n will be available in grocery and convenience stores and pharmacies, like most of these drinks.\n\n""We attack [insomnia] from two angles,"" Healy says. ""You\'ve got to turn off all the stimulants and also get into a natural sleep cycle.""\n\nMelatonin is used for the latter, while ingredients such as valerian root and chamomile take care of the former, Healy says. Both of those herbs are associated with soporific effects, according to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database. Valerian root has properties that resemble the benzodiazepine class of medications (such as Valium and Xanax), but Scharf says he has no idea how they compare with standard sleeping pills because of the lack of comparative studies.\n\nFinding a niche\n\n\n\nContainers of relaxation drinks look similar to those of energy drinks. Many mimic the diminutive shape of the 5-Hour Energy shot or the bright graphics and tall, narrow can of Rockstar or Monster. Flavors range from a pleasant, fruit-flavored soda to just shy of cough syrup.\n\nMany relaxation beverages contain safety labels that warn consumers that they should neither drive or operate machinery after drinking them, nor mix them with alcohol. Some say they aren\'t intended for people younger than 18 or for pregnant or nursing women - a warning that the Food and Drug Administration has also made about melatonin.\n\nIn January 2010, the FDA sent a warning letter to the Innovative Beverage Group, which makes the relaxation beverage Drank, saying the melatonin it uses is an ""unapproved food additive"" and not ""generally recognized as safe.""\n\nDrank is still being sold with melatonin in it. In a statement, Drank inventor Peter Bianchi says ""the safety of Drank\'s consumers remains a top priority"" and the company is working to modify the product\'s packaging and marketing ""to reflect its classification as a dietary supplement.""\n\nThe FDA regulates conventional beverages\' ingredients and labeling claims more strictly than those of dietary supplements. Drank is still classified as a beverage.\n\nThe relaxation drink market is tiny compared with the energy drink market, says Garima Goel Lal, a senior analyst at the consumer research firm Mintel.\n\nA Mintel survey found that 48 percent of all ""functional beverage"" users said they were looking for beverages to release stress.\n\nA functional beverage - the term is used for sport, energy and relaxation drinks - is a nonalcoholic drink that claims to have health benefits. The number of nonalcoholic beverages making relaxation claims continues to rise; 40 new ones came on the market in 2010, according to Mintel. The field is too young to identify the leaders and the losers, Goel Lal says.\n\n""They\'re trying to find a niche,"" she says.\n\nMultiple choices\n\n\n\nKatherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has blogged about relaxation drinks. She says that people with certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure, should consult their physician before downing a can of Unwind or any of the other sleep beverages.\n\n""A person can just go to the convenience store and purchase this,"" Zeratsky says. ""There\'s this perception that it\'s safe and, depending on the person, it might not be a good choice.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">In reporting on a new wave of products, the story’s major shortcoming was the lack of discussion about lifestyle/behavior changes, which are the long term solutions for insomnia.</span>","This story reported on so-called “relaxation drinks” that contain melatonin, valerian, and other supplements that marketers say will help put you to sleep.

The legs become uncomfortable when lying down or sitting, and the condition can disrupt sleep and take a toll on the quality of life, the researchers said.\n\nOne expert, Dr. Martin Niethammer, a neurologist at the Movement Disorders Center of North Shore-LIJ\'s Cushing Neuroscience Institute in Manhasset, N.Y., said this study is merely a review of the current treatments for restless legs syndrome.\n\n""There is nothing new here at all,"" he said. ""It doesn\'t add anything to the field.""\n\nThis is just a compilation of evidence that follows guidelines that have been long established in both Europe and the United States, Niethammer said.\n\n""These are the only treatments approved by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],"" he added.\n\nThe report was published in the March 4 online issue of JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nFor the analysis, Wilt\'s team reviewed 29 clinical trials. The researchers found that 61 percent of those taking dopamine agonists showed at least a 50 percent improvement in their symptoms, compared with 41 percent of those taking an inactive placebo.\n\nIn addition, those taking dopamine agonists slept better and scored higher on measures of quality of life. Dopamine agonists were originally developed to treat Parkinson\'s disease.\n\nSide effects of dopamine agonists can include euphoria, hallucinations, weight loss, nausea, insomnia, tiredness or weakness, dizziness and drowsiness.\n\nThere are generic versions of Requip that cost far less, running between $11 and $22 a month. Insurance covers the treatment in most cases, so actual out-of-pocket costs will vary by insurance plan. The same is true for levodopa, Wilt said.\n\nNeurontin and Lyrica also helped relieve symptoms in 61 percent of patients, compared with 37 percent of those taking a placebo, the researchers found.\n\nThe most common side effects of these drugs include fatigue, swelling in the legs, dizziness and weight gain.\n\nWithout insurance, Lyrica costs can run more than $100 a month, but again co-pays will vary by plan, Wilt said. The same is true for Neurontin, which can cost $117 to $135 a month without insurance.\n\nWilt noted there is no information on the effectiveness of treatments in pregnant women, young or old patients, those with milder symptoms or those with other serious medical conditions. ""We urge caution in extending our conclusions to these individuals,"" he noted.\n\n""Treatments for restless legs syndrome is now frequently advertised direct-to-consumer, and thus while this may enhance awareness it may result in patients seeking treatment for milder or other conditions not well-studied,"" he explained.\n\nThe harms of medications may outweigh benefits for these individuals, Wilt said. ""Up to 25 to 50 percent with even moderate to severe and longstanding symptoms stop taking these medications after more than a year due to either side effects or lack of benefit,"" he noted.\n\nNonetheless, for people with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome symptoms, these medications provided important benefits, at least in the short term, Wilt said.\n\nPatients should tell their doctors if they have bothersome sensations in their legs that include distressing, irresistible urge to move them that is relieved by rest, Wilt said.\n\n""This may be due to restless legs syndrome or other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is important. Effective treatments for restless legs syndrome are available, and in patients with more severe symptoms may include medications,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on restless legs syndrome, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']",The story could have provided more helpful context about potential benefits of the drugs in question.  But the story’s warning about the potential for disease-mongering in this area was especially salient.,"The story induced some uncomfortable cognitive dissonance that should have been resolved. The publication of a study, and this associated news coverage, implies that there is some “news” about treatments for restless leg syndrome to report. But an expert source goes unchallenged when he says, “There is nothing new here at all.” So either there’s news here which the story doesn’t adequately explain, or the expert source is right and there’s no news.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nScientists from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute and the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) said the protein, called microseminoprotein-beta or MSMB, is found at reduced levels in men diagnosed with the disease and are also lower in men with more aggressive forms of the cancer.\n\n“The protein is easy to detect because it is found in urine and would potentially be a very simple test to carry out on men to identify those most at risk of developing the disease,” said Hayley Whitaker of the Cambridge institute, who led the study.\n\nWhitaker said that while it could be around five years before the results of this study are translated into a test for doctors to use in clinics, she hoped it would then also help them to determine which patients have aggressive tumors.\n\nProstate cancer killed an estimated 258,000 men around the world in 2008 and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States. In Britain, around 35,000 men are diagnosed with it and some 10,000 die from the disease.\n\nThe most effective screening tests currently available are based on a single biomarker called prostate specific antigen (PSA). But PSA testing is problematic because it has low specificity, which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment.\n\nA U.S. study published last year found that routine PSA prostate screening has resulted in more than one million American men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.\n\n“At the moment, PSA testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations, so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as MSMB that could be used in screening and diagnosis,” said Rosalind Eeles of the ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital, who also worked on the study.\n\nThe protein — which regulates prostate cell death — is produced by normal prostate cells.\n\nThe scientists took tissue and urine samples from around 350 men both with and without prostate cancer to test MSMB levels.\n\nThe results, published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) ONE journal, showed that MSMB is found at significantly lower levels in the urine of men diagnosed with prostate cancer than those without the disease. They also showed men with aggressive tumors were also likely to have lower levels of the protein in their urine.\n\nCommenting on the study, Kate Holmes of the UK’s Prostate Cancer Charity, said they could prove very valuable in future.\n\n“Given the known limitations of the PSA blood test, finding a technique to accurately diagnose prostate cancer is the Holy Grail of research into the disease,” she said in a statement.\n\n“An accurate, reliable urine test for prostate cancer would be an invaluable tool if it is proven to be successful on a large scale.”""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story’s first sentence foresees a day with ""a quick and simple test"" for prostate cancer risk.  But in leaping to that future possibility, it jumped over a discussion of data – today – limited though that may have been.  Which is, of course, the story. </span>"," This is a story about a study for a test under development, the results of which suggest that it may be better able to predict which diagnosed prostate cancers are aggressive and which are not.  This would be an exciting development as indicated by the spokesperson from the UK Prostate Charity.  However – the story should have tempered its enthusiasm a bit until the results have been reproduced.

Only human clinical trials can show if this is the case. The release doesn’t quantify any improvements, define any potential harms from the drug, name who funded the work or offer any insights into conflicts of interest. While it mentions the drug is now available in China and Japan, it offers no information on its probable cost if approved for sale in the West.
The release headline doesn’t mention that this study took place in rodents. As a result, some news story headlines are echoing that this drug has been found to reverse brain effects of alcohol, never making it clear that the results apply only to rodents.

It\'s designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis. While not quite a cure, the drug is extremely effective for some CF patients.\n\nBut the success of Kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making.\n\nA good starting point for the story is Aug. 24, 1989. That\'s the day scientists from the U.S. and Canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease. It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize.\n\nCF is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. When people inherit a damaged form of the CF gene, a critical protein inside cells doesn\'t work properly. As a result, sticky mucus builds up in a patient\'s lungs, causing infections and making it hard to breathe.\n\nThe announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the Sept. 8 issue of Science, but a reporter for Reuters got hold of the story early. Science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication.\n\nAt the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach.\n\nThe first prediction turned out to be right. ""But it wasn\'t until 20 years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis,"" says Fred Van Goor, who led the team at what is now Vertex Pharmaceuticals that developed Kalydeco. ""So it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of Kalyedco.""\n\ntoggle caption Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nIt took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the CF gene makes. ""We tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis,"" says Van Goor.\n\nOne of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug, but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth, and so it would last the right length of time in a patient\'s body.\n\nFrom the start, Van Goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.\n\nBut for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well.\n\nEmily Schaller was in one of the early studies of Kalydeco. As part of the study, researchers first gave her a placebo, then switched her to the active drug. She knew within days that something was different.\n\n""I was with my brother in Florida, and we were walking down the street, and I took a deep breath, and when I took a deep breath in and I let it out, I didn\'t cough,"" says Schaller. ""But not only did I not cough, but I felt that my lungs were clear, and that something huge had happened. It was just something I had never felt in my life before.""\n\nSchaller isn\'t cured. She still has a damaged CF gene. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one. Although it seems simple in theory, in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish.\n\nSchaller isn\'t particularly bothered by that. ""Everyone talks about curing a disease — cure CF, cure these other diseases. [But] Kalydeco controls CF at the basic defect, so I\'m OK with the other \'c\' word, control, because I\'m living it and I\'ve never felt better in my life.""\n\nThe time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.\n\nThey\'re also likely to be expensive. Kalydeco costs in the neighborhood of $300,000 per year.']","The star score doesn’t reflect the strong points about this piece. The story was told with an engaging and interesting style, and provided historical reflections on the science and on past journalism on the topic.  Still, we wish it had provided more evidence and more outside perspective.","This is a story about the early promise of gene therapy failing to translate into an array of new clinical treatments. In a way, the story mirrors the problems with gene therapy that it describes. It promises to be a powerful antidote to all the hype surrounding gene therapy. It provides some targeted information relevant to a subset of patients, but it ultimately does not deliver a very well rounded picture of the drug it describes, skipping over specific details about benefits, harms, availability and true novelty. We give NPR a lot of credit for taking on the topic at all and admire the economy of storytelling for such a complicated topic. At the same time, the story may have covered more ground in the same amount of time by including some independent voices and providing a few hard numbers to back up claims that the drug was “remarkable” and “stunning.”

In a hip replacement, an artificial joint comprising a ball and socket is implanted to replace the natural ball and socket in the pelvis, enabling movement that is typical of the hip joint. While dislocations only occur in about 1 percent of patients after hip replacement, certain individuals may be at a higher risk.\n\nNYU Langone research presented at last year\'s AAOS Annual Meeting showed that spinal deformity was a significant risk factor for dislocation and subsequent revision surgery. The researchers reported at the time how the lumbar spine, or lower back, moves during posture changes like transitioning from sitting to standing, creating alterations in so-called spinopelvic relationship,"" which changes position of the hip socket and may cause an implant to dislocate in a person with spinal deformity.\n\nThis led researchers to further develop a risk prediction tool to better identify which patients undergoing a hip replacement may be at higher risk for dislocation, and then implement a treatment algorithm to help reduce that risk.\n\n""Dislocation is a common reason for a total hip replacement to fail, and when it happens, sufferers can experience significant pain and require another surgery to fix the problem,"" explains lead study author Jonathan Vigdorchik, MD, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU School of Medicine and associate fellowship director of the Division of Adult Reconstructive Surgery at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital. ""Orthopedic surgeons need to be more aware of this problem and think about the risk of dislocation prior to performing a hip replacement instead of just dealing with the complications after the surgery. We need to be proactive in our approach.""\n\nWhat the Study Found\n\nSome newer hip implants are designed with dual mobility cups that allow for increased range of motion, which helps reduce dislocation risk. However, no guidelines currently exist to aid clinicians in deciding when to use these more flexible implants, which are often more expensive than conventional implants, may not be medically necessary, and may carry added risks if implanted unnecessarily.\n\nFor the study, researchers reviewed data on 1,082 total hip replacements performed using computer navigation between January 2014 and December 2015, during which period no dual-mobility implants were used. The overall implant dislocation rate among this cohort was found to be 1.8 percent. Of this group, 320 patients had spinal disease and deformity as evidenced by imaging scans, and of them, 10 experienced dislocations, suggesting a dislocation rate of 3.1 percent for high-risk patients, or about three times higher than normal.\n\nBeginning in 2016, surgeons used the standardized risk prediction model and treatment algorithm developed at NYU Langone, which factored in data collected from preoperative imaging taken while the patient was sitting and standing, and other measures that might affect risk for dislocation, including presence of a previous lumbar fusion. Using the risk assessment tool, the researchers identified 192 of 1,009 patients as high risk for a dislocation after surgery. All 192 patients underwent a total hip replacement through the high-risk algorithm, with dual mobility implants being used in 143 of the cases. The researchers reported only one dislocation in this high-risk group (or 0.5 percent of high-risk patients), compared with 3.1 percent in the previous group not assessed with the risk assessment and treatment algorithm. These findings represent a six-fold decrease in the rate of dislocation in the high-risk group.\n\n""There were significantly fewer dislocations in the high-risk group once all of our patients were analyzed through our new treatment algorithm,"" explains study co-author Aaron J. Buckland, MD, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery in the Division of Spine Surgery and director of spine research at NYU Langone. ""We were able to stop these implant dislocations from occurring in the first place, sparing our patients follow-up care and the need for revision surgery.""\n\nAll patients who undergo hip replacement at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital now go through the risk assessment screening and treatment algorithm prior to surgery. Other technologies including laser-guidance, computer navigation, and robotic surgical devices are used for the especially high-risk and complex cases identified through the algorithm in order to ensure the best possible outcome free of complications.\n\n###\n\nThis research presented at the conference has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal and is currently in submission. Future studies aim to examine how the algorithm affects long-term outcomes and clinical benefits in patients at high risk for dislocation.\n\nThis poster, ""A New Risk-Assessment Score and Treatment Algorithm for Patients at High Risk of Dislocation following Total Hip Arthroplasty,"" was selected by the AAOS Central Program Committee as the Best Poster in the Adult Reconstruction Hip classification at the 2018 AAOS Annual Meeting.

Compared with those who did not undergo the protocol, these patients had lower rates of hip dislocation after their surgery, which would presumably reduce the need for revision surgeries to replace a failed implant. How did the protocol help? The release suggests that pre-operative imaging scans helped identify and guide the treatment of patients with spinal problems who needed so-called dual mobility implants. These implants allow a greater range of motion and are credited with decreasing the risk of a hip dislocation.
Here’s what we liked about the release: It features a relatively thorough description of how the study was conducted, quantifies the benefits in absolute terms, and gives good insight on why such a presurgical assessment might be helpful to direct patient care. Our main concern is this:  The release suggests that the new protocol deserves all the credit for the better outcomes, when in reality it’s not clear whether other factors played a role. Information about costs and the potential harms of dual mobility implants would also have been helpful for readers.

These findings suggest the pills may help protect against death in patients with pneumonia.\n\nStatins such as Lipitor, Crestor, and a generic called simvastatin are widely prescribed to lower so-called “bad” or LDL cholesterol — a risk factor for heart disease — and are credited with being among the most successful drugs in helping to prevent heart attacks and strokes.\n\nSeparate research published in March found that lowering cholesterol levels could help the body’s immune system fight infections, a finding that appears to be supported by Tuesday’s study.\n\n“Statins are safe, cheap, and an easy intervention in terms of delivery,” said Ian Douglas, a lecturer in epidemiology at the LSHTM who led the research.\n\n“Given the potential low number needed to treat to prevent a death suggested by this study, we believe that a strong case exists for randomized trials of statins in people with serious infection to determine if a simple and practical intervention at the point of diagnosis of pneumonia has a beneficial effect.”\n\nDouglas’s team, whose research was published in the British Medical Journal, used data from computerized medical records of doctors’ practices in Britain to identify statin users.\n\nThey then matched each statin user — who was aged over 40 when first prescribed a statin between 1995 and 2006 — with up to five non-statin users for comparison.\n\nPatients with a record of pneumonia were followed for six months to see if they died, and the researchers found that 13 percent (109 out of 847) of statin users died compared with 20 percent (578 out of 2,927) of non-statin users.\n\nDouglas noted that since this study looked at patients who were already taking statins when they developed pneumonia, a full randomized clinical trial was needed to find out whether starting a statin at the time of diagnosis has a similar effect.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was a problematic story.  Much of the content and some quotes appear to be taken directly from a news release.</span>","And here’s why that’s important: There was no discussion of costs or harms, insufficient information about limitations, and no independent perspectives.

And while this study showed some symptomatic improvement, it didn\'t have enough objective data to show that the new technique would surpass surgery, she said.\n\nBenign prostate hyperplasia, also known as enlarged prostate, is a non-cancerous condition familiar to millions of aging males. The condition occurs when the prostate gland slowly enlarges and presses on the urethra, constricting the flow of urine.\n\nEnlarged prostate is characterized by a host of unpleasant symptoms, including weak or slow urine flow, an urgent need to urinate frequently, incomplete bladder emptying and having to get up repeatedly at night to urinate.\n\nThe surgery for enlarged prostate -- transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP -- is used for men whose prostates are smaller than 60 to 80 cubic centimeters. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and involves a hospital stay.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no size limitation for PAE, which requires only local anesthesia and also lowers the risk of other side effects, such as blood loss and retrograde ejaculation, which occurs when semen leaks into the bladder, researchers said. PAE can be an outpatient procedure as well.\n\nFor the procedure, a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin. The catheter delivers tiny ""grains"" to the arteries that lead to the prostate, which block blood flow and lead to shriveling of the gland.\n\nIn this study, PAE helped most of the 67 patients who underwent the procedure, according to the researchers, who noted that 66 men who had not responded to medications experienced improvements in symptoms as well as a reduction in prostate volume.

People who experience them see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations) and/or have false beliefs (delusions). The hallucinations and delusions experienced with Parkinson’s disease are serious symptoms, and can lead to thinking and emotions that are so impaired that the people experiencing them may not relate to loved ones well or take appropriate care of themselves.\n\n“Hallucinations and delusions can be profoundly disturbing and disabling,” said Mitchell Mathis, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Nuplazid represents an important treatment for people with Parkinson’s disease who experience these symptoms.”\n\nAn estimated 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease each year, according to the National Institutes of Health, and about one million Americans have the condition. The neurological disorder typically occurs in people over age 60, when cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine become impaired or die. Dopamine helps transmit signals between the areas of the brain that produce smooth, purposeful movement -- like eating, writing and shaving. Early symptoms of the disease are subtle and occur gradually. In some people Parkinson’s disease progresses more quickly than in others. As the disease progresses, the shaking, or tremor, which affects the majority of people with Parkinson’s disease, may begin to interfere with daily activities. Other symptoms may include depression and other emotional changes; hallucinations and delusions; difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking; urinary problems or constipation; skin problems; and sleep disruptions.\n\nThe effectiveness of Nuplazid was shown in a six-week clinical trial of 199 participants. Nuplazid was shown to be superior to placebo in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions without worsening the primary motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.\n\nAs with other atypical antipsychotic drugs, Nuplazid has a Boxed Warning alerting health care professionals about an increased risk of death associated with the use of these drugs to treat older people with dementia-related psychosis. No drug in this class is approved to treat patients with dementia-related psychosis.\n\nIn clinical trials, the most common side effects reported by participants taking Nuplazid were: swelling, usually of the ankles, legs, and feet due to the accumulation of excessive fluid in the tissue (peripheral edema); nausea; and abnormal state of mind (confused state).\n\nNuplazid was granted breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease. Breakthrough therapy designation is a program designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. The drug was also granted a priority review. The FDA’s priority review program provides for an expedited review of drugs that offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.\n\nNuplazid is marketed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Diego, California.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###\n\nInquiries Media: Sandy Walsh 301-796-4669 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA\n\nRelated Information']",An anti-psychotic drug that was given priority regulatory review is now on its way to market. The release on the drug’s approval skims over the benefits and the slim evidence which could leave readers with questions about the drug’s safety and effectiveness.,"This news release from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announces the agency’s recent approval of a new drug marketed as Nuplazid (pimavanserin) for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The release leaves several crucial questions unanswered. We’re not told how much the drug will cost or how significant is the improvement offered by Nuplazid over placebo. A recent article in Stat that summarized an FDA panel’s recommendation to approve the drug, which the FDA followed, found that “In the pivotal trial behind Acadia’s marketing application, Nuplazid showed only modest improvements over placebo, and was tested in a way that makes it difficult to compare against other treatments.”
A public memo from the FDA on Nuplazid seems to suggest for about every two patients who are expected to benefit greatly from Nuplazid, another patient will suffer a significant side effect.
The release provides very little quantitative information but spends a great deal of time explaining the many symptoms of PD.

The authors, from Cleveland Clinic in the US, say considering radiosurgery earlier on could make a big difference to patients\' lives.\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a very painful nerve disorder that causes an electrical shock feeling in the face, usually in older people. Some things can trigger it, like chewing or even the wind blowing, but attacks can be random. On a scale of 1-10, patients often describe the pain as 15 - off the scale. TN is commonly treated with anti-epileptic medications. While this can reduce the pain, it makes patients drowsy and tired, and they report feeling drunk. This has an impact on their quality of life and frequently causes depression, as it stops them from driving, working or even just leaving the house.\n\nAccording to the new study, radiosurgery, which is normally a second line treatment to be used following the medication, helps improve quality of life and reduce depression in patients with TN. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly.\n\n""We knew radiosurgery results in pain relief, but we didn\'t know if the patients actually felt better,"" said Dr. Samuel Chao, corresponding author of the study. ""I think people go and see their neurologist and get the pain under control with medication, but they don\'t realize how lousy this can make them feel. Using radiosurgery earlier on allows patients to get off the medications, improving their quality of life by allowing them to return to activities they used to do.""\n\nRadiosurgery is a method for physically treating the nerve using radiation - with stereotactic radiosurgery, doctors can focus 192 beams of radiation on a single point. It is non-invasive, so doesn\'t require the healing time of traditional surgery. Treatment takes less than an hour and requires no anesthetic. However, it is often overlooked or delayed as a treatment because there is a lack of capability and experience with the method. Research has shown that radiosurgery reduces pain for 80% of patients, but the broader impact on their lives remained unknown.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Chao, Dr. Kotecha and his colleagues prospectively collected data from 50 patients they treated with radiosurgery using two questionnaires: EuroQOL 5-Dimension and Patient Health Questionnaire 9. They asked questions about the patients\' pain and facial numbness, their health and their ability to take care of themselves. The researchers analyzed patients\' answers before treatment and at each follow-up appointment, and found that patients reported an improved quality of life and lower rates of depression after radiosurgery. Importantly, the benefit of treatment was strongly driven by improvements in pain and discomfort as well as self-care.\n\n""Pain and the medication to stop the pain make it difficult for people with TN to go outside and live life,"" explained Dr. Chao. ""With radiosurgery, we can reduce pain, improve quality of life and decrease depression - people can go out and enjoy life without worrying they will have a random attack. Giving options empowers the patient to be more aware of themselves and manage their own condition.""\n\nThe team plans to analyze the impact of other treatment options and carry out a cost-based analysis to establish the best treatment options for TN.\n\n###\n\nNotes for editors\n\nThe article is ""Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia Improves Patient-Reported Quality-of-Life and Reduces Depression,"" by Rupesh Kotecha, Jacob A.

The results of this pilot study, published in the peer-reviewed journal European Neuropsychopharmacology, suggest that this may become an effective medical treatment for patients with cocaine addiction, although a larger trial is needed to confirm the initial findings.\n\nCocaine use is widespread in the Western World. Last year, 2.3 million young Europeans (aged 15 to 34) used cocaine, and the US National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that 1.4 million Americans suffer from cocaine addiction1. There is no effective drug treatment for cocaine addiction, with behavioural therapies being the main element of any treatment regime. Now a group of researchers working in Italy and the USA have shown in a preliminary clinical study that cocaine use can be reduced by treatment with rTMS (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation).\n\nAs author, Dr Antonello Bonci (Scientific Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Adjunct Professor, John Hopkins University, Baltimore) said:\n\n""Despite the fact that more than 20 million people worldwide suffer from cocaine use disorders2, there are no effective neurobiological treatments for patients with this devastating condition"".\n\nThe practical work was conducted by team of scientists led by Dr Luigi Gallimberti, from the University of Padova Medical School, Italy, who enrolled 32 patients who were seeking treatment for cocaine addiction at the hospital clinic. The participating patients were randomized to receive either rTMS or standard symptom-relieving medications.\n\nThe experimental group received one rTMS session per day for five days, and then once a week for the following three weeks, for a total of 8 TMS sessions over 29 days. Those in the control group received pharmacological treatment for symptoms associated with cocaine addiction (such as depression, anxiety and sleep problems). The study indicated the safety of rTMS in patients with cocaine addiction. There was significantly less craving and there were a significantly higher number of cocaine-free urine drug tests in the rTMS compared to the control group. In addition, 69% (11/16) patients) in the experimental group showed no relapse to cocaine use, whereas only 19% (3/16) patients) in the control group showed a similar positive result (the results are adjusted for patients who dropped out of the trial).\n\nDr Bonci said: ""rTMS is a non-invasive and very safe therapeutic approach which is used with other mental health and neurological conditions, such as depression and neuropathic pain. Our study suggests that rTMS may also represent a new treatment for patients with cocaine use disorder"".\n\nAt the end of the first 29 days of the experiment, the experimental group was given the option of continuing the treatment, whereas those in the control group were given the possibility of receiving the same rTMS treatment as the experimental group for 63 days. Results further confirmed the beneficial effects of rTMS in helping patients to maintain abstinence from cocaine.\n\nDr. Bonci continued: We consider this study promising but preliminary. We need to replicate the work in a bigger group of patients using sham-TMS as the control condition. As far as we know, this work represents the first clinical report indicating that rTMS treatment results in significant reduction in cocaine use. It is also important to emphasize that, in this study patients were seeking treatment for their cocaine addiction in a hospital setting: the group studied, albeit small, was a ""real world"" sample. We have continued to follow patients from the trial, and the improvement seems to be sustained over time, up to 12 months, although we don\'t have any hard data on that yet. It is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial.\n\nWe decided to target an area of the brain involved in decision making, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL PFC). This was because previous animal studies from our lab had shown that compulsive cocaine-seeking was associated with hypoactivity in the prelimbic cortex, which is a brain area that shares similar behavioural roles to the DL PFC. Importantly, we had found that increasing the activity in the prelimbic cortex could significantly reduce cocaine self-administration"".\n\nCommenting European Neuropsychopharmacology editor, Dr Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg (Mannheim) said,\n\n""This study represents a creative approach to a disorder that is notoriously difficult to treat in the real world. These pilot data also show that biological treatments nowadays reach far beyond medications and that new neuroscience methods may be used for targeted changes in brain regions relevant for complex mental disorders"".\n\n###']",This news release on magnetic brain stimulation to combat cocaine addiction has something we don’t often see in releases — lots of underscoring of the research limitations.,"This release reports the findings from a small pilot study asking whether rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) to certain parts of the brain in cocaine users can limit their use and affect their cravings for the drug. The results showed a decrease in both use and cravings for cocaine among the experimental group, as compared to a control group which only received medicinal drugs to address the effects of cocaine. The release did not address costs or the availability of rTMS treatments; otherwise it was a good, readable overview of an intriguing study.

For cigarette smokers who waver at the edge of a decision to quit and consider strategies to ease the transition, a new study finds that the all-in approach is more likely to work than wading in slowly.\n\nIn a clinical trial that pitted would-be quitters who stopped smoking altogether on quit day against those directed to wean themselves off the butts over two weeks, researchers found that those who went cold turkey were more likely than gradual taperers to succeed in quitting for four weeks and for six months.\n\nThe differences weren’t overwhelming: at four weeks, 39.2% of the gradualists were no longer smoking, compared to 49% of the do-it-nowers. At six months 15.5% of the gradualists and 22% of those who stopped smoking on quit day were “former smokers.” But in a group of this size, those differences are considered statistical proof that quitting abruptly is a superior strategy to tiptoeing into the decision.\n\nThe study was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose numbers also underscore a somewhat depressing truth among cigarette smokers wishing to quit: Failure is common. Most studies have shown that roughly one-in-four quitters who use medicines to aid in their effort is able to remain abstinent for six months, and many who make it that far subsequently relapse. Successful quitters tend to have one thing in common: Most of them tried to quit many times before succeeding.\n\nThe study was conducted in Great Britain, where participants included 697 people who smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day or who had diminished lung capacity consistent with regular smoking. To participate, subjects had to agree to quit within two weeks of enrollment. They were then assigned to either an abrupt-quit or gradual-quit group.\n\nEnrollees in the gradual-quit group did get to choose whether, in the two-week period over which they were to stop smoking, they would taper their daily cigarettes, observe smoke-free periods, or smoke on a schedule. While they followed those gradual-quit patterns, they wore nicotine patches and got fast-acting nicotine products, including gum, tablets, lozenges and sprays.\n\nAt a nurse visit one week before their final-quit day, the gradualists had reduced their cigarette consumption, on average, by 48% -- just short of the 50% goal. By quit-day, they had reduced on average by 68% (short of the 75% goal).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe abrupt-quitters were issued nicotine patches, which they wore for the two weeks leading up to their “quit day.” After that, they were issued nicotine-replacement products to ease their withdrawal. And despite being told not to alter their smoking patterns as their quit-day approached, they did decrease their smoking by an average of 29%.\n\nAfter the two-week period was up and cessation began in both conditions, both groups experienced withdrawal symptoms and urge intensities that were roughly the same.\n\nThe provision not only of nicotine-replacement products but of schedules, structure and professional encouragement for gradual quitters likely “optimized” those participants’ likelihood of success, the researchers said. And yet, their success rates still fell well below those of abrupt-quitters.\n\nThe latest finding falls in line with other research on quitting. It may be that those who choose to quit gradually are not as committed to quitting as are those willing to take the plunge, but since participants here were randomized to their condition, this study suggests that different levels of motivation might not fully explain the different rates of success.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that this is hardly the last word on the best way to quit. In a large population of smokers, the gradual approach might feel kinder and gentler to many smokers, and prompt more to attempt quitting more often. Quitting gradually is, at least, sometimes successful. So, over time and in a large population, getting more people to try might result in greater reductions in smoking than abrupt quitting, they acknowledge.\n\nHere’s what the American Cancer Society says about quitting, and the often-discouraging statistics:\n\n“The truth is that quit smoking programs, like other programs that treat addictions, often have fairly low success rates. But that doesn’t mean they’re not worthwhile or that you should be discouraged. Your own success in quitting and staying that way is what really counts, and you have some control over that. Even if you don’t succeed the first few times, keep trying. You can learn from your mistakes so that you’ll be ready for those pitfalls next time.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @LATMelissaHealy and “like” Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.']","Is going cold turkey better than gradually cutting back on cigarettes?

Chemotherapy before surgery might provide a false assurance that there\'s no more residual cancer, whereas microscopic tumour may remain after the surgery, leading to cancer recurrence and possibly, death.\n\nThe surgery should be aggressive in an attempt to remove all visible signs of the tumour, and to avoid leaving any residual disease. The goal is to have no cancer visible to the naked eye of the surgeon after the surgery.\n\nSurgery should be followed by intraperitoneal, or localized, chemotherapy delivered to the abdomen. Localized chemotherapy works best if there\'s no residual cancer after the initial surgery. It is the combined effect of surgery and chemotherapy that works best.\n\n""For decades, women have been treated with a combination of treatment options, resulting in poor prognosis for most women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, but there are many survivors as well,"" said Dr. Narod, senior scientist at Women\'s College Research Institute.\n\n""Women need support to endure surgery and the rigours of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, but should be encouraged to do so whenever possible, considering the potential survival benefits,"" said Narod. ""We should offer all women the possibility of a cure.""\n\n###']",Would changing the chemo-surgery treatment order and adding an adjunct chemotherapy in patients with late-stage ovarian cancer vastly improve their chance for survival?

REUTERS/Darren Staples\n\nIn the largest study yet of the effect of this type of antidepressant on stroke recovery, French researchers found that stroke patients given Prozac improved their scores in motor skills tests more than those given a placebo, or dummy pill.\n\nExperts commenting on the findings said they had “enormous potential to change clinical practice” and raised the question of whether most stroke patients with motor skill problems should be treated with this relatively cheap type of antidepressant.\n\nStroke is the single largest cause of adult disability and the third-largest cause of death in the developed world.\n\nThe cost of caring for its victims, who often have motor function difficulties like paralysis or weakness on one side, puts a heavy burden on already stretched healthcare systems.\n\nA few previous small trials had already suggested that giving drugs like Prozac, which belongs to a drug class known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), might improve motor skill recovery after stroke.\n\nProzac was developed by Eli Lilly and is now available in a cheaper generic form as fluoxetine.\n\nHemiplegia — paralysis to one side of the body — and hemiparesis — weakness on one side of the body — are the most common disabilities after stroke and scientists believe SSRIs might help improve movement by increasing the level of the brain chemical serotonin in the central nervous system.\n\n“The positive effect of the drug on motor function... suggests that the neuronal ... action of SSRIs provides a new pathway that should be explored further,” said Francois Chollet of Toulouse University Hospital, who led this research.\n\nIn the study, conducted between March 2005 and June 2009 and published in The Lancet Neurology journal Monday, 118 patients in France were given either Prozac or a placebo for three months starting between five and 10 days after they had suffered a stroke.\n\nAll patients were also given physiotherapy, and had their motor skills tested at the start of the trial and on day 90.\n\nSignificantly greater improvements in motor function were recorded after three months in patients taking Prozac, where the average test score improved by 34.0 points, than in the placebo group, where the average improvement was 24.3 points.\n\nThere were also more independent patients and depression was less common in the Prozac group than in the placebo group, and side effects of the drug were rare and mild, researchers said.\n\nCommenting on the study, Robert Robinson and Harold Adams from the University of Iowa in the United States, said it could change the way doctors treat stroke victims in future, but more research is needed to see if the effects continue over time.\n\nRoger Bonomo, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said another way to look at the implications of this trial would be as justification for treatment of post-stroke depression before it progresses.\n\n“Depression after stroke is a common enough complication to have raised the question of treating with antidepressants early after stroke,” he said in an emailed comment. “If motor function is also more likely to improve, then treating before symptoms of depression emerge is likely to be even more beneficial.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">This story’s single sentence about the need for longer studies is far from sufficient balance to the array of forward-looking statements based on early evidence.<br/>

The study is the first large, multi-institutional study of SBRT in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up.\n\nAlthough prostate tumors generally respond well to radiation therapy (RT), the possibility of radiation exposure to healthy tissue in the genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) systems can be of concern. SBRT is an advanced technique that precisely targets high doses of RT to the tumor in a small number fractions, simultaneously avoiding surrounding tissue and reducing toxicity to non-cancerous cells. The technique has become the standard of care for many non-surgical lung cancer patients, as it limits exposure to the heart and surrounding lungs. When treating tumors in the prostate, SBRT avoids the adjacent bladder, sex organs and rectum.\n\n“Single-institution studies on the use of SBRT as the primary treatment for prostate cancer have illuminated the treatment as a cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT,” said Robert Meier, MD, lead author of the study and a radiation oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. “Our study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.”\n\nA total of 309 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were enrolled in the trial at 21 community, regional and academic hospitals across the U.S. Eligible patients had either low-risk disease (CS T1-T2a, Gleason 6, PSA < 10) (n = 172) or intermediate-risk disease (CS T1c-T2b with either Gleason 7 and PSA < 10, or Gleason 6 and PSA 10-20). All of the men received SBRT via a non-isocentric robotic platform, with an RT dose to the prostate of 40 Gy administered in five treatment sessions of 8 Gy each. Intermediate risk patients received a dose of 36.25 Gy to the seminal vesicles. Concurrent and adjuvant androgen ablation therapy were prohibited among study participants.\n\nPrimary outcomes included GU and GI toxicities and relapse-free survival (RFS). Researchers measured toxicity using the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Biochemical failure was assessed using the ASTRO-consensus and the nadir+2 definitions. Overall survival (OS) was measured as a secondary outcome for the study. Actuarial OS and RFS were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier statistical method. Median follow-up was 61 months.\n\nAt five years following SBRT, 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression. In low-risk patients, the cancer control rates was superior to historical controls. Specifically in the low-risk group, the five-year RFS rate was 97.3 percent, which is superior to the 93 percent historical comparison DFS control rate (p = 0.014). Actuarial five-year OS was 95.6 percent for the entire cohort. Actuarial five-year nadir+2 RFS was 97.1 percent for all patients, representing 97.3 percent of low-risk and 97.1 of intermediate-risk patients. Actuarial five-year ASTRO RFS was 92.3 percent and 91.3 percent for low- and intermediate-risk groups, respectively.\n\nFewer than two percent of all patients experienced serious side effects in the five years following SBRT. Five grade three GU side effects were reported in four of the 309 study participants. There were no reported grade four or five toxicities nor any grade three GI toxicities. Between half and two-thirds of patients experienced less serious side effects, with rates of 53 and 59 percent for grade one GU and GI toxicities and rates of 35 and 10 percent for grade two GU and GI toxicities, respectively. These side effects were usually temporary.\n\n“Our results illustrate how advanced technology has radically improved our ability to target cancer,” said Dr. Meier. “After following patients for more than five years, we found that serious side effects from a brief course of SBRT were uncommon and that cancer control rates were very favorable compared to historical data. Our trial confirms that SBRT may be preferable to other treatment approaches for newly-diagnosed cases of prostate cancer, including more aggressive disease.”\n\nThe abstract, “Five-Year Outcomes from a Multi-Center Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer,” will be presented in detail during a scientific session at ASTRO’s 58th Annual Meeting at 7:45 a.m. Eastern time on Monday, September 26, 2016.

Pain relief was sustained in six patients who continued treatment for one year. All patients received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to their primary motor cortex once a week for at least 12 weeks.\n\nSatisfactory relief was considered a 40 - 69 percent reduction in pain scores (6 patients) and excellent relief, pain reduction of 70 percent or more (5 patients). Overall, 8 patients who had severe stroke-caused dysesthesias, such as uncomfortable numbness or prickling, experienced less relief than patients without severe dysesthesias, suggesting possible neural circuit damage was inhibiting response to treatment.\n\nThe study participants had all been treated medically after a blood clot or bleed in one side of the brain (unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke). Several weeks into their recovery, they had begun to experience severe hand or leg pain as a consequence of brain damage from the stroke. Such central post-stroke pain can be extremely disabling and difficult to treat, impacting general functioning, mood, and overall quality of life.\n\nSince the 1990s, Japan has been an active center of research into the study of electrical motor cortex stimulation (EMCS) to treat post-stroke pain using surgically implanted devices. The study reported at the INS 12th World Congress builds on observations that electrical motor cortex stimulation’s effectiveness in relieving central post-stroke pain can be predicted by rTMS, suggesting the techniques share similar pain-relief mechanisms.\n\nHowever, Kobayashi and colleagues point out in their peer-reviewed online publication of this study, “Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Once a Week Induces Sustainable Long-Term Relief of Central Poststroke Pain” (Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface: April 23, 2015)[1] that there has still been controversy about the efficacy of rTMS in post-stroke pain. Kobayashi said in comparison to EMCS, his impression is rTMS efficacy seemed almost the same, without requiring surgery.\n\nIn 2014, a review[2] suggested that there is probable efficacy (a level A recommendation) for short-term rTMS treatment of neuropathic pain, including central post-stroke pain, but did not speak to long-term efficacy.\n\nSince pain relief from rTMS increases a few days after treatment, weekly treatment sessions were selected to try to sustain pain relief at treatment intervals that could be maintained on an outpatient basis.\n\nKobayashi believes neurologists would especially have an interest in this method, which is also attractive due to its low side-effect profile. None of the 18 patients reported any serious side effects from weekly sessions of 10 trains of 10-second 5Hz rTMS, at 90 percent of the active motor threshold. Two patients reported transient, slight scalp discomfort after rTMS.\n\nIn addition to the potential of rTMS in pain relief, there has been growing research into noninvasive stimulation to augment progress in physical rehabilitation soon after stroke. It is believed that the stimulation aids in plasticity, the ability of the brain to gradually form new neural connections to take on functions previously performed by damaged areas.\n\nA first phase of the study assessed whether rTMS had a treatment effect on pain. In it, the research team randomly assigned six patients to receive either sham or active rTMS one week and the other treatment the next, measuring pain scores before and after each session.\n\nOnce that phase had shown that rTMS did reduce the patients’ pain, an open-label treatment phase began. In this second phase, the 18 patients underwent 12 weekly rTMS sessions. The patients’ pain scores were measured just before each weekly session.\n\nData were collected for eight years, ending in 2014. Kobayashi said that some patients really hoped to continue rTMS after the study because their pain worsened after rTMS treatment sessions were over, and almost all the patients said that after the study ended, their pain increased to the level before rTMS.\n\nHe added that the remaining question to answer is whether the level of the patients’ severe uncontrollable pain would continue to decrease if rTMS continued for several years.\n\n']",This release didn’t mention the limitations of an open-label study that had only 18 patients. Such context is crucial for readers to understand how much weight to give to the study.,"NIH illustration of rTMS therapy.
This news release speaks to the results of a small open-label study examining the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients who have suffered a stroke. The 18 patients studied all had chronic pain as a consequence of their stroke and did not obtain adequate relief from more traditional approaches. The release includes useful background about the burden of post-stroke pain and the history of research into rTMS as a treatment option. But the study’s small size and lack of control group are key limitations that should have been commented on, but weren’t. We also think that since the device is commercially available and is in widespread use for depression, cost should have mentioned as well as a few words about other treatment options.

""Athletes who drank the milk, compared to those who did not, scored higher after the season than before it started, specifically in the areas of verbal and visual memory.""\n\nFootball players were tested before the season, after concussions and post-season using Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing, also called ImPACT™, a widely used computer-based evaluation for concussions. Overall, 36 variables for attention span, working memory, sustained and selective attention time, response variability, non-verbal problem solving and reaction time were measured in the study.\n\nExperimental groups drank Fifth Quarter Fresh after each practice and game, sometimes six days a week, while control groups did not consume the chocolate milk. Analysis was performed on two separate groups: athletes who experienced concussions during the season and those who did not. Both non-concussed and concussed groups showed positive effects from the chocolate milk.\n\nNon-concussed athletes who drank Maryland-produced Fifth Quarter Fresh showed better cognitive and motor scores over nine test measures after the season as compared to the control group.\n\nConcussed athletes drinking the milk improved cognitive and motor scores in four measures after the season as compared to those who did not.\n\nThe remaining test scores did not show a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups over the season, according to Shim.\n\nHe suggested that the naturally occurring high levels of specific nutrients in Fifth Quarter Fresh likely contributed to the results.\n\n""Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are important for energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain,"" said Shim.

Fifth Quarter Fresh may help them prevent injuries by providing their bodies with the nutrients they need to heal and repair. This study suggests that,"" said Doak. ""Our milk provides 20 grams of protein and five grams of undamaged BCAAs per 14-ounce serving—naturally. We use no supplements and no preservatives—it is fresh chocolate milk.""\n\nOfficials in Washington County, Md., home to all seven high schools participating in the study, are now considering the broad adoption of Fifth Quarter Fresh in sports programs throughout its school system.\n\n""There is nothing more important than protecting our student-athletes,"" said Clayton Wilcox, superintendent of Washington County Public Schools.

They are almost absent from this boastful release touting vague neurological benefits of a specific chocolate milk. The release says high school football players, including some who suffered concussions, who drank the milk improved their scores on a computer-based concussion evaluation, but the release not only doesn’t say how much improvement was seen, it doesn’t even say which of the 36 measurements in the test improved. The release highlights the protein, calcium and electrolyte content of the milk, without ever mentioning each serving also contains the equivalent of eight teaspoons of sugar. Perhaps the most worrisome aspect of this case is the status of the “study” it is based on. The study does not appear to have been independently reviewed or published.
This review and a related blog post calling attention to the issues raised within have sparked much news coverage and led to a University of Maryland investigation into policies surrounding research quality, conflict of interest, and public relations. More links to our coverage can be found here.

Maugh II\n\n3:15 PM PST, January 12, 2011\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision on whether to give young children antibiotics to treat ear infections has been swinging from one extreme to the other as conflicting clinical trials have pushed pediatricians first toward widespread use of antibiotics, then toward a “watch and wait” approach in which most infections seem to clear up on their own.\n\n\n\nTwo new trials reported Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine are nudging the pendulum back toward treatment of the infections, known formally as acute otitis media, especially for the youngest children. They show that the use of antibiotics in infants under age 2 is only modestly effective and reduces the duration of symptoms by only a small amount, but it prevents relapses and progression of the disease.\n\n\n\nThe trials “are indicative of a benefit to treatment of acute otitis media in children, specifically when the diagnosis is certain,” said Dr. Wilbert Mason, an infectious diseases specialist at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles who was not involved in the study. The reduction of symptoms was marginal, he said, “but they were less likely to have a relapse or to have persistent signs of infection at the end of therapy.”\n\n\n\nThe findings “confirms the current guidelines” for treating children under age 2, said Dr. Al Lieberthal of USC’s Keck School of Medicine, who is in charge of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee that prepared the guidelines. The guidelines will be revised in light of the new studies, however, to tighten the definition of acute otitis media, he added.\n\n\n\nThere have been at least a dozen previous clinical trials studying the use of antibiotics in ear infections, known formally as acute otitis media. These have given mixed results, according to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, because of poor study design and especially because of poor diagnosis of the subjects’ conditions.\n\n\n\n“In many cases, [the children] had something that looked like otitis media but really wasn’t,” he said. The new studies “had really precise criteria to be eligible for enrollment,” which makes them “substantial studies.”\n\n\n\nIn one of the studies, Dr. Alejandro Hoberman of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and his colleagues studied 291 children age 6 months to 23 months with stringently defined acute otitis media. Half were given the antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 days and half a placebo.\n\n\n\nIn the second study, Dr. Paula A. Tahtinen of Turku University Hospital in Finland and her colleagues studied 319 children age 6 months to 35 months, half of whom were given the antibiotic and half a placebo for seven days.\n\n\n\nIn the Pittsburgh study, 80% of the children receiving an antibiotic had a resolution of symptoms by day seven, compared with 74% of those receiving a placebo. But 67% of those receiving an antibiotic had a sustained resolution of symptoms, compared with 53% of those who got the placebo.\n\n\n\nThe Finnish study looked for continuing symptoms, which is known as treatment failure. It found that, at the end of seven days, treatment failure occurred in 18.6% of those who received antibiotic, compared with 44.9% of those who received a placebo.\n\n\n\nThat sounds like a big improvement, said Dr. Richard Rosenfeld, chair of otolaryngology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, who also helped prepare the AAP’s guidelines, “but all it means is that if the eardrum looked nasty, the treatment failed. Eardrums sometimes take weeks to months to recover. That finding, to me, is a bit of a dubious way to say that everybody needs treatment.”\n\n\n\nExperts noted, however, that certain children should receive immediate antibiotic treatment regardless of age. That includes those who are under 6 months of age; those who have a draining ear caused by a ruptured eardrum; those with severe symptoms early on; and those with infections in both ears.\n\n\n\nBut physicians are reluctant to give antibiotics indiscriminately because of the side effects, which include diarrhea, yeast infections, oral thrush, allergic reactions and resistant bacteria. “You pay a price for a little bit of improvement,” Rosenfeld said.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Overall, a credible job in telling the story of the latest chapter of the long saga of debate over treatment options for common childhood ear infections. </span>","Two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine show slight decrease in recurrence of ear infections in children under 2 if antibiotics are given. The story quotes one expert saying the studies are “substantial” but also quotes a second expert who says the results are a “dubious way to say that everybody needs treatment.”
The story could have explored the shared decision-making encounter that parents could have with pediatricians based on this new evidence.  By comparison, CNN’s story did a much better job helping parents with this angle.

(Photo: Dima Gavrysh / AP)\n\nChicago — Local bans on artery-clogging trans fats in restaurant foods led to fewer heart attacks and strokes in several New York counties, a new study suggests.\n\nThe study hints at the potential for widespread health benefits from an upcoming nationwide ban, the authors and other experts say. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 gave the food industry until next year to eliminate artificial trans fats from American products.\n\nNew York City enacted a restaurant ban on the fats in 2007 and several counties in the state did the same. Hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes in those areas declined 6 percent starting three years after the bans, compared with counties without bans. The results translate to 43 fewer heart attacks and strokes per 100,000 people, said lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, a Yale University cardiology fellow.\n\nHis study was published Wednesday in JAMA Cardiology.\n\nTrans fats, also called partially hydrogenated oils, enhance food texture and structure. They were once commonly used to make restaurant fried chicken, French fries, doughnuts and other foods and found in grocery items including cookies, crackers and margarine.\n\nThese fats can boost blood levels of unhealthy cholesterol, increasing risks for heart problems. The FDA in 2006 required them to be listed on food labels and the food industry has been switching to healthier oils.\n\nThe researchers examined hospital admissions data from 2002 to 2013 in 11 New York counties that adopted bans and in 25 counties that did not.

On fertile days, users must abstain from sex or use other protection such as condoms to prevent pregnancy. The app was approved as a class IIb medical device by Tüv Süd, a notified body in Sweden where it is based.\n\nBut sexual health organisations are warning that being classed as a medical device does not guarantee that the app will effectively prevent pregnancy. Sexual health charity the FPA, Fertility UK, and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are jointly calling for more large-scale independent trials to ensure that evidence for such apps is on a par with other rigorously tested methods of contraception.\n\nNatural Cycles is one of numerous apps that help women practise a method of contraception called natural family planning, also known as the fertility awareness method.\n\n\n\nNatural family planning involves monitoring your body for signs of ovulation, like an increase in your temperature, or a change in cervical mucus.\n\n""The thing about the female egg is that it only lives for about 24 hours. So if you could reliably know when you\'ve ovulated as a woman, and then you give that egg two or three days to die, any time after that in the cycle you will not get pregnant because there\'s no egg to fertilise,"" Dr Susan Walker, a senior lecturer in sexual health at Anglia Ruskin University, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\n\nTaking your temperature is what sets Natural Cycles and other apps like it apart from standard period-tracking apps. Without temperature information an app can can guess at your ovulation day based on your average cycle length, but can\'t be sure when you actually have ovulated, and so you can\'t use it as a reliable form of birth control.\n\nYou don\'t actually need an app to practise natural family planning – although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you’re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators – temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions.\n\nBut natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs.\n\nAnd if you\'re considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won\'t like having to remember to take your temperature every morning.\n\n""You really have to commit to it, whether you\'re doing it the traditional way or you\'re using an app. You have to take your temperature every morning and record that, because without all that data it\'s not really any use to you,"" Bekki Burbidge, head of communications at the FPA, told BuzzFeed News. ""It\'s not a method that\'s going to suit everybody.""\n\nBut for women like Natural Cycles co-founder Dr Elina Berglund, who want an alternative to hormonal contraception, it\'s an option worth pursuing. Along with her husband and co-founder Dr Raoul Scherwitzl, Berglund created the algorithm used in the app for personal use, before deciding it was something she should share with the rest of the world.\n\n""When it comes to contraception it\'s all about choice. It\'s not like one solution will fit all women,"" said Berglund.\n\n""Our typical user is in a stable relationship a few years before wanting to have kids. At first she starts to use the app to prevent pregnancy, and when she\'s ready [to get pregnant] she switches to plan, and usually she gets pregnant quite quickly, because the app already knows her body and cycle.""\n\n\n\nTo use the app, you need a monthly or yearly subscription, and a thermometer that you have to use to take your temperature each morning before you get out of bed.\n\n\n\nThe app then tells you if you\'re likely to be fertile or not that day. And if the app gives you a ""red day"" – meaning you could be fertile – you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.']","The story is balanced, provides an excellent summary of the research on the app’s effectiveness for preventing pregnancy, and makes clear the limits of the evidence.","BuzzFeed’s take on an app to aid in birth control ends up being a very informative piece on the plusses and minuses of a variety of birth control methods. With the context provided, readers learn a bit about a woman’s monthly cycle and how so-called natural family planning works. This method is an alternative to such contraceptive stalwarts as the pill and the IUD, and serves a population that may have reason to avoid more medical interventions requiring doctor’s visits.
We especially appreciated that the writer noted that users must be diligent to get the best results: “And if you’re considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won’t like having to remember to take your temperature every morning.”
The story is balanced, provides an excellent summary of the research on the app’s effectiveness for preventing pregnancy, and makes clear the limits of the evidence.

Its discussion of FDA rules governing device approvals is valuable.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of rapid, irregular heartbeat that puts people at increased risk for stroke. Approving new devices or surgical techniques to help reduce risk for these patients is important, and so this story is important for helping raise the alarm about a device that might not be safe enough and might need further testing. This story does a good job with several layers of complexity — how the regulatory process may have a loophole, the freedom doctors have to use devices off-label, and the new study that concludes by recommending surgeons should hold off on using the new Lariat device until more studies are done. These strengths notwithstanding, the story could have done a better job of describing current practices to prevent strokes in patients with AF and how this device may or may not be an additional option. It is known that a variety of blood thinners can significantly decrease the risk of stroke in patients with AF. However, there are risks associated with these blood thinners, including bleeding (including life-threatening bleeds in the brain that can be as serious as the effect of the blood clot they are trying to prevent), that mean not all patients can use them.

British researchers presented the disappointing findings Thursday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas.\n\n""As a whole, the study is negative,"" study author Dr. Robert Coleman, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield in England, said during a Thursday news conference on the findings. ""There is no overall difference in recurrence rates or survival rates [between patients who got the bone drug and those who did not], except in older patients, defined as more than five years after menopause.""\n\nThat was a possible bright spot in the results.\n\n""In that population, there is a benefit,"" Coleman said. The older women had a 27 percent improvement in recurrence and a 29 percent improvement in overall survival over the five-year follow-up, compared to those who didn\'t get the drug.\n\n""There was tremendous hope that this [drug] approach would be a major leap forward,"" Coleman noted. ""There have been other trials that suggest this is the case."" In one previous study, the use of the drug was linked with a 32 percent improvement in survival and lowered recurrence in younger women with breast cancer.\n\nOther research has found that healthy women on bone drugs were less prone to develop breast cancer, so experts were hoping the drugs had an anti-tumor effect.\n\nZometa, marketed by Novartis AG, is used to relieve pain when cancers have spread to the bone -- in part, by slowing bone erosion caused by the disease. It is given intravenously, while other bisphosphonates such as Actonel, Fosamax or Boniva can be taken orally.\n\nIn the trial, known as AZURE (Adjuvant Treatment with Zoledronic Acid in State II/III Breast Cancer), Coleman and his colleagues evaluated 3,360 breast cancer patients from 174 participating centers, all with stage II or III cancers but no evidence of metastases (cancer that has spread beyond the original site). About half received the bone drugs plus standard therapy; half just got standard therapy.\n\nThe focus was on disease-free survival. After five years, about 400 women in each group either died or had recurrences.\n\nWhen Coleman\'s team looked at subgroups, however, they found the benefit among older women, a finding they say warrants more study.\n\n""The younger patients are getting no benefit,"" Coleman said. ""If anything, they are doing a little bit worse.""\n\nIn addition, there were some troubling side effects among women taking Zometa, including 17 cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (a severe bone disease that can result in death of the jawbone).\n\nDr. Sharon Giordano, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, was not involved in the study but put it in perspective. Bisphosphonates have been used to treat osteoporosis as well as bone complications of breast cancer treatment, she said.\n\n""The role of bisphosphonates in preventing cancer recurrence has been less clear,"" she said, noting that multiple studies have had conflicting findings.\n\nAs for the benefit found in postmenopausal women, she said, ""I would consider this hypothesis-generating and not practice-changing.""\n\nOther studies underway may provide a clearer answer, she said.\n\nSince the current study was presented at a meeting, its findings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nSaid Coleman: ""Zoledronic acid cannot be routinely recommended for prevention of cancer returning, but it remains a very good drug for patients where the cancer has already spread to the bone.""\n\nColeman disclosed receiving speaker fees from Novartis; the researchers also received academic grant funding from the drug maker.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on bisphosphonates, visit U.S. Food and Drug Administration.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">When something doesn’t work, say so.

The story accurately described the main conclusions of the study and did not oversell the promise of a subgroup analysis showing that zoledronic acid might give post-menopausal women a survival advantage. The story pointed out specific adverse events, including bone disease in the jaws of some women in the trial.It pointed out financial support from the pharmaceutical company that sells the drug being studied. The article wasn’t perfect. It didn’t explain the regulatory status of zoledronic acid for women with early breast cancer.  It expressed the survival advantage of the subgroup of post-menopausal women in relative rather than absolute terms.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture provided partial funding for the study.\n\nMany foods can have an effect on cholesterol levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Foods containing saturated fats, trans fats and dietary cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels, while foods with healthier fats such as olive oil can lower your cholesterol. Foods with fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, can reduce cholesterol levels, while carbohydrates that are low in fiber tend to raise triglyceride levels and lower ""good"" HDL cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the current study, the researchers wanted to assess the long-term effect that apple consumption might have on cardiovascular health.\n\nThey recruited 160 women between the ages of 45 and 65. The women were randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups. One group was given 75 grams of dried apples every day for a year, while the other group was given dried prunes daily for a year.\n\nThe daily serving of dried apples contained about 240 calories, according to the study. An apple contains about 5 grams of fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. LDL cholesterol dropped by 23 percent. Daily apple consumption also significantly lowered levels of C-reactive protein and lipid hydroperoxide, two substances that may indicate an increased risk of heart disease. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract.\n\nThe researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body.\n\nDespite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn\'t gain weight over the course of the study. In fact, they lost an average of 3.3 pounds.\n\nRegistered dietician Jessica Shapiro said she wasn\'t surprised that the women didn\'t gain weight. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.\n\n""Apples really are an amazing fruit for many reasons,"" said Shapiro, who is a clinical nutritionist who counsels cardiac patients at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. ""A large reason apples are so good is the fiber. Apples have both soluble and insoluble fiber. Insoluble is found more in the skin, and the pulp is more soluble fiber.""\n\n""The pulp of an apple gets to be a very viscous gel-like substance that grabs cholesterol and pulls it out of the body. It\'s kind of like nature\'s toothbrush, and it\'s brushing the bad stuff out,"" she explained.\n\n""Another good thing in apples is pectin. It\'s a substance that\'s used to make jellies or jams, and pectin contributes to the viscosity of what\'s going through the body, and bulks it up to help remove it. Apples also have tons of antioxidants and other natural components,"" she said.\n\nShapiro said she would recommend fresh apples over dried apples, because some nutrients are probably lost in the drying process.\n\nBut Shapiro stressed that making healthy changes to what you eat can only do so much.\n\n""Changing your diet can make a big difference, but eating a healthy diet is only part of it. Once your cholesterol is high, diet may not be enough,"" she said. ""Some people are predisposed because of their genes to having high cholesterol, and a healthy diet may not be enough.""\n\nShapiro also advised against making any changes to your medications, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, without talking to your doctor first.\n\nAlso, she cautioned, when increasing the fiber in your diet, do it slowly. This will help prevent bloating and gas that may occur if you increase your fiber intake too quickly. She said that 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily is the recommended intake, and she suggested increasing your current intake by about 5 grams daily each week to give your body a chance to get used to the increased fiber.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about the importance of fruits and vegetables from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story relies on a news release (a statement from a researcher) and an abstract of a talk not yet given at a scientific meeting.  That’s an incomplete basis for a widely distributed health news story. </span>","Granted, it sought an independent nutritionist’s perspective but she was reacting to the same incomplete information from an abstract of a talk not yet given.

The unusual fractures that may be associated with certain osteoporosis drugs called bisphosphonates occur lower on the bone. Ironically, that\'s where the femur, the longest bone in the body, is usually strongest.\n\nThese unusual fractures can occur suddenly without any trauma, such as a fall. And they can be complex breaks that are difficult to fix and slow to heal.\n\nIn the study, published in current issue of JAMA, researchers looked at 716 of these fractures in more than 200,000 Ontario women who had taken bisphosphonates.\n\nWomen who had taken the drugs for five years or longer had nearly a three times higher risk of suffering atypical fractures compared with women who had only transient exposure to such drugs.\n\nThat\'s called the relative risk, and it seems alarming. But the ""absolute risk"" of these unusual fractures is still pretty low — 13 fractures per year for every 10,000 people taking bisphosphonates for five years or longer. That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent.\n\nMoreover, the study verified that long-term use of bisphosphonate drugs reduces the risk of typical osteoporosis fractures by 24 percent. That\'s obviously a lot more benefit than risk.\n\n""The big message really is the number of typical hip fractures is much, much larger than the number of unusual thigh fractures,"" says Dr. Gillian Hawker of St. Michael\'s Hospital in Ontario, an osteoporosis specialist and study author. ""So although we believe there is an increased risk of these unusual fractures, it doesn\'t outweigh the benefit"" of taking osteoporosis drugs.\n\nMerck, which makes Fosamax, the original and leading bisphosphonate drug, criticizes the new study. The company said in a statement to Shots that women who had atypical fractures were different from those who didn\'t. For instance, they started out with a history of more fractures, so the comparison isn\'t valid.\n\n""Merck believes that the results must be interpreted with caution and should not be overstated,"" says the company\'s statement.\n\nStill, the accumulating evidence that there is a risk of these serious, unusual fractures associated with bisphosphonates is getting a lot of attention in the medical community.\n\nLast fall the Food and Drug Administration issued a ""safety update"" urging doctors and patients to be on the lookout for the problem. Often, the FDA says, an atypical fracture is preceded by pain in the thigh, apparently from a small stress fracture that signals bone weakness. ""Although it is not clear if bisphosphonates are the cause, these unusual femur fractures have been predominantly reported in patients taking bisphosphonates,"" the FDA says.\n\nThe concern is heightened by another, even rarer possible side effect – osteonecrosis of the jaw. Basically, it means that part of the jawbone dies.\n\nSome reports – including one published earlier this month in the Journal of Dental Research — have found a higher risk of the jaw problem in dental patients taking bisphosphonates.\n\nAgain, Merck disputes the connection. Earlier this month it convinced a New Jersey jury that Fosamax did not cause one woman\'s jaw problems.\n\nAmid all the debate, many specialists are wondering if women on bisphosphonates should take a ""holiday"" from the drug from time to time. The idea is that perhaps they\'d get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures. ""You could do five years on, five years off,"" Dr. Clifford Rosen, a bone specialist at Maine Medical Center, tells Shots. ""Some people are doing three on and three off.""\n\nBut at some point, should these patients start taking the drug again? ""I don\'t think anybody knows,"" Rosen says. ""The thought is you would have to put them back on at some time.""']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Good job of explaining a potentially confusing study. Extra points for including discussion of relative vs. absolute risk. Extra points for explaining a “thigh” fracture that is not near the hip.</span>","There was a very clear explanation of the difference between relative and absolute risk.  And a very clear summary statement: “That’s obviously a lot more benfit than risk.”
The story ends with another strong point: discussing some of the issues that women should be discussing with their doctors in a truly informed shared decision-making environment.

The promising data from this pilot study could have greater implications for adults with food allergies.\n\nThe cancer patients who were allergic to allergens such as cat dander and ragweed saw their allergic skin test reactivity reduced by 80 to 90 percent in one week, and this persisted with continued use of the drug for at least one to two months. The findings were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in May.\n\n""It almost completely knocked out the patients\' skin test and blood cell allergic reactivity,"" said senior author Dr. Bruce Bochner, the Samuel M. Feinberg Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\nThis FDA-approved drug, ibrutinib, is currently on the market as a successful and less-toxic alternative to chemotherapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. In this recent study, Bochner and his team performed traditional allergy skin tests and the basophil activation test, a related allergy test using blood cells, on cancer patients before they had taken ibrutinib and again after one week and after one to two months of taking it.\n\nA rather unlikely pairing - cancer and allergies - Bochner thought to test if a cancer drug could prevent allergic reactions by collaborating with Feinberg\'s oncology department.\n\nHe knew that the generally well-tolerated cancer drug was successful in blocking a protein inside a cell called Bruton\'s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). BTK plays a crucial role in B cell activation, growth and maturation and mast cell and basophil activation, the latter two cells being responsible for immediate allergic reactions. Bochner teamed up with Northwestern oncologist Dr. Leo Gordon and colleagues to test if this BTK inhibitor could shut down an enzyme inside cells that is involved when you have an allergic reaction.\n\n""Ibrutinib is considered a game changer in these two types of cancers,"" said Gordon, the Abby and John Friend Professor of Cancer Research at Feinberg. ""We understood that it might have some biologic effects in what Bruce is interested in, so we were happy to participate in his study. It\'s an interesting repurposing of that drug.""\n\nWhile the study was small - only two patients qualified out of about 35 that were screened for allergies - the implications are much larger for later phases of this study. Bochner and his colleagues Drs. Anne Marie Singh and Melanie Dispenza are now testing how successful the drug is at targeting allergies to food, such as tree nuts and peanuts.\n\n""Preventing or lessening the severity of an allergic reaction to a food you\'ve ingested that you\'re allergic to is kind of the holy grail of food allergy treatment,"" Bochner said. ""I don\'t know if this or similar drugs will ever make it possible for a peanut-allergic person to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but we\'re excited to use this approach to teach us how to lessen the risks of food allergy reactions.""\n\nCurrently, the study is being expanded to adults with food allergy to see if their skin test and basophil activation test responses show a similar reduction with just a few doses of ibrutinib and how long such benefits might last. If the results are favorable, the next step would be to get funding to actually test whether taking a BTK inhibitor will improve the ability of food-allergic adults to eat foods they\'re allergic to.\n\n""The hope is that drugs like BTK inhibitors will protect people with food allergies from having anaphylaxis, or at least increase how much of that food they can eat without reacting,"" Bochner said. ""Maybe they\'ll increase from being able to eat just one peanut to 10 before they react. Or maybe they\'ll be able to eat a full meal\'s worth of peanuts. We want to know if this would safely change their actual ability to eat foods that they currently need to avoid.""\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded by a 2016 Dixon Translational Research Grant.']","The release should have been more clear that this study has significant limitations in both sample size and duration of effect and that nothing is known about whether this effect can be repeated usefully, reliably or safely.","What we have here is a tentative demonstration of a new concept in allergy treatment, reported in a brief letter to the editor of a medical journal, which is puffed up to look like proof of effectiveness. Meanwhile, looming challenges of both safety and cost are soft-pedaled or ignored. There is legitimate news that an anti-allergy effect of a cancer drug (ibrutinib), previously observed in lab and animal experiments, has now been seen in two patients. But the release buries the limitations of the study and ignores serious safety and cost challenges, while highlighting speculative musings about food allergy treatments that were not part of this study. Most readers of this release would likely be surprised to learn that ibrutinib has potentially life-threatening side effects and that the dosage studied costs more than $100/day.

Unfortunately, new research reported Wednesday suggests that there is little women can do other than grin and bear it, since there appear to be no effective treatments.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry once weighed in on the issue heavily, with the result being the introduction of the now-notorious thalidomide, which caused severe birth defects in a large number of infants. That episode led to increased requirements for safety screening of drugs before they are marketed and led to the still-prevalent consensus that it is generally not safe for women to take drugs during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, when morning sickness is at its worst. That has led many women to try alternative treatments, including sugar solutions, ginger, vitamin B6, acupressure and acupuncture. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that any of them are effective, Dr. Anne Matthews of the School of Nursing at Ireland’s Dublin City University reported Wednesday in the Cochrane Library, a prestigious source of research on the effectiveness of medical treatments.\n\nAs many as 85% of pregnant women experience nausea, and half of those endure actual vomiting. The cause is unknown, but researchers suspect hormonal imbalances. About 1 in 200 suffer so severely that they cannot keep any food or liquids down, a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum. It requires medical treatment and can cause blood clots and damage to the infant. On the plus side, a 2007 study found that women who suffer morning sickness are less likely to develop breast cancer.\n\nMatthews and her colleagues reviewed 27 clinical trials involving 4,041 pregnant women who were as much as 20 weeks pregnant. In six studies of acupuncture and two of acupressure -- in which pressure is applied to acupuncture sites rather than needles -- they found no benefit. One study of acustimulation, in which a small electric current is applied through the needles, found some benefit over three weeks. There was also very little evidence to support the benefits of ginger (which actually made many women sick), vitamin B6, antihistamines and anti-vomiting drugs. The anti-vomiting drugs induced sleepiness in recipients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“A number of the studies we looked at appeared to show benefits, but in general the results were inconsistent and it was difficult to draw firm conclusions about any one treatment in particular,” Matthews said in a statement. “We were also unable to obtain much information about whether these treatments are actually making a difference in women’s quality of life.”\n\nYour best bet, according to most experts: Get plenty of rest, drink a little at a time but often to prevent dehydration, and eat small servings of bland food such as toast and crackers. Also, avoid strong smells; eating food cold rather than hot can minimize odors that cause nausea.\n\n-- Thomas H.

Building upon previous research, the study challenges the widely held belief that recovery from a TBI is limited to two years after an injury.\n\n""A TBI disrupts brain structure. These brain changes can interfere with brain network communication and the cognitive functions those networks support,"" said Dr. Kihwan Han, research scientist at the Center for BrainHealth and lead author of the study.\n\n""For people with chronic TBI, they may have trouble with daily tasks such as creating shopping lists and resolving conflicts with others for many years after the injury. These findings provide hope for people who thought, \'This is as good as my recovery is going to get\' and for the medical community who have yet to find a way to objectively measure a patient\'s recovery,"" he said.\n\nThe study included 60 adults with TBI symptoms lasting an average of eight years. Participants were randomly placed into one of two cognitive training groups: strategy-based training or knowledge-based training. Over an eight-week period, the strategy-based training group learned strategies to improve attention and reasoning. The knowledge-based training group learned information about the structure and function of the brain as well as the effects of sleep and exercise on brain performance.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging measured cortical thickness and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) before training, after training and three months post-training. Previous studies have shown that cortical thickness and rsFC can be potential markers for training-induced brain changes.\n\nIndividuals in the strategy-based reasoning training showed a greater change in cortical thickness and connectivity compared to individuals who received the knowledge-based training. Changes in cortical thickness and functional connectivity also correlated to an individual\'s ability to switch between tasks quickly and consistently to achieve a specific goal.\n\n""People who showed the greatest change in cortical thickness and connectivity, showed the greatest performance increases in our cognitive tasks. Perhaps future studies could investigate the added benefit of brain stimulation treatments in combination with cognitive training for individuals with chronic TBI who experience problems with attention, memory or executive functions,"" Han said.\n\n###\n\nThe work was supported by the Department of Defense, the Meadows Foundation and the Friends of BrainHealth Distinguished New Scientist Award.']",The release doesn’t tell us how physiological changes in the brain translate to meaningful cognitive improvements for a person living with long-term TBI.,"This news release from the Center for BrainHealth at the  University of Texas at Dallas describes findings from a recent study on the effects of brain training for people with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI). The release is a little fuzzy on the details.
The news release should have included numbers to put the benefits in context and explained how changes in cortical thickness — the main outcome studied — translates to cognitive improvements (and what types of improvements) for a person living with long-term TBI.

story_reviews_01569,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/2830/,2010-05-03 20:18:01,Magnetic brain stimulation fights depression,"['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A daily dose of electricity delivered to a specific part of the brain can lift depression, new research confirms, even for people who’ve already tried multiple antidepressants to no avail.\n\nWhile there’s evidence that this technique, known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), helps depressed people get better-and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved TMS for this purpose-many skeptics have questioned whether it really works, notes Dr. Mark S. George of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, the lead author of the new study.\n\nThe biggest issue with studies so far, he explained, has been that it’s tough to fake the sound and sensation of the real device in order to run a gold standard clinical trial in which some people get the treatment, and others get a sham treatment, no one knowing which.\n\nBut George and his team say they’ve solved that problem by developing a dummy device that clicks in a similar way to the real thing and causes a person’s eye muscles to twitch, just like real a TMS device.\n\nIn the May issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, George and his colleagues report the results of their 190-patient study, the most rigorous investigation of TMS for depression so far. The researchers randomly assigned participants to receive 37.5 minutes of TMS delivered to a part of the brain region that plays a role in emotion, or 37.5 minutes of sham TMS, once a day for three weeks.\n\nAfter three weeks, 14 percent of patients in the real TMS group had recovered from their depression, compared to 5 percent of the sham TMS group; people who had the real treatment were four times as likely to get better as those who got the fake treatment.\n\nBased on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover.\n\nEighty-eight percent of the study participants completed the first phase of the trial. Patients in both groups were equally likely to report side effects, which included headache, discomfort at the TMS site, and eye twitching.\n\nIn a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. Thirty percent of the patients in the second phase recovered from depression.\n\nHow long the treatment should last is not yet clear. “It’s very muddy now exactly how long we need to treat patients,” George said. “It looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up.”\n\nPatients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor — and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that’s been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects.\n\nTMS works by producing an electrical current that can pass through the skull and into the target area of the brain. George said he believes the approach works by “resetting” electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation.\n\nSomething similar is likely happening, he added, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or what is sometimes referred to as “electroshock treatment.” Sixty to 70 percent of depressed people who undergo ECT, in which electrodes placed on the front of the brain induce a convulsion while the patient is anesthetized, will recover.\n\nGeorge said he hopes that by better understanding where TMS should be delivered and by figuring out the best dose and duration of treatment, success rates closer to those of ECT might be achieved. “I’m optimistic that it’s pointing us in a path of understanding how to interact with the brain in a non-invasive way to get people well.”\n\nSOURCE: Archives of General Psychiatry, May 2010.']","A reasonably good story. More detailed info on costs, availability, and alternatives to TMS would have broadened the context for readers and increased the story’s overall usefulness.    ","A few key issues were missed:
Finally, it would have been ideal if the story had briefly mentioned the major treatment options for a patient with major depression who fails the first treatment:  change in medication or combinations of medication, psychotherapy with or without medication, and neurostimulation such as TMS or ECT.  An independent expert perspective could have helped with this.
